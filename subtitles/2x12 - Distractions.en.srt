1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,044
Whoo!

2
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:08,363
All right, hold on.
I got to turn up here.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,671
Whoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

4
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:19,864
How cool was that?

5
00:00:19,918 --> 00:00:21,881
That was way cool.

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,220
Oh.

7
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:27,417
My turn.

8
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:28,723
No, sorry, that's not allowed.

9
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:32,062
I just signed 15 pages of forms,
saying you gotta ride
on the back of that thing.

10
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:33,753
I don't see any lawyers around.

11
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:35,076
You know that's not the point.

12
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,277
No, you just wanna keep
all the fun to yourself.

13
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:41,506
Come on, Dad.

14
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,192
You go over 15,
we're pulling over.
All right, I mean it.

15
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:47,009
- You're the best.
- All right, get on there.

16
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:48,789
Put on your goggles.

17
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:51,386
Ready?

18
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,908
Got the clutch in?
All right, that's my boy.

19
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:57,069
Whoo! Hoo-hoo!

20
00:00:57,787 --> 00:00:59,788
Whoo!

21
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:03,472
Whoo!

22
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,665
Adam, you're going too fast.
Slow it down.

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,233
I mean it.
You're going too fast.
Slow down!

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,559
Adam!

25
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:25,545
Adam!

26
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,737
Let go of the throttle!

27
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,982
Adam! Adam! Adam!

28
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:43,353
2x12 - Distractions

29
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,812
Original Airdate (FOX):  14 February-2006

30
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:13,412
What do you got?

31
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:17,419
16-year-old, status post, ATV crash,
40% of burns on his body.

32
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:20,518
Nasotracheal intubation.
Start a bag of lactated Ringer's,
wide open.

33
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:21,377
Is he gonna be okay?

34
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,670
We'll be with you when we can.
Get him out!

35
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,966
Wait, wait, wait.

36
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,440
I'll start fluids.

37
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,317
Let's go get him moved up.

38
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:46,657
De-re-maki.

39
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,163
De-re-maki.

40
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:52,577
Been looking for you.

41
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,484
Been avoiding you.

42
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,785
Burn unit can handle it.

43
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,772
If they could handle it,
they wouldn't be asking for you.

44
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:02,119
Is that a journal?

45
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:03,373
A friend wrote an article.

46
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:04,527
In Hindi?

47
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:07,739
They have a cutting edge
neuroscience program in India.

48
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:10,193
Says so right on the cover.

49
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:16,400
This kid's heart rate's messed.

50
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:18,854
Tachycardia can be
explained by the burn.

51
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:21,070
I assume the burn unit knew that.

52
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:25,089
His potassium's low.

53
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:27,167
Which can also be
explained by the burn.

54
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:29,918
Except I'm sure the burn unit's
pumping him with fluids,

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,424
which means his potassium
should be going up, not down.

56
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:34,007
Could be amphetamines.

57
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:36,079
Or bacteria lunching on his heart.

58
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:39,518
Or cardiomyopathy, or
some other very bad thing.

59
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:41,227
He needs an EKG.

60
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,674
Eww.

61
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:51,459
Okay, no skin, no EKG.

62
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,453
Is he even going to survive the burn?

63
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:55,854
You got a date or something?

64
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:58,747
40% of his body.

65
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:01,179
If the burns unit can
prevent an infection,

66
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:05,257
his body will regenerate maybe 10%.
Surgeon's will do 20 or so grafts.

67
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:08,576
Six months in this room,
he'll end up with a series of nasty scars.

68
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:11,530
Maybe some pain,  but he'll live.

69
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:17,347
Unless his heart shuts down, because
we can't figure out what's causing
the low potassium and tachycardia.

70
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:22,194
We need help from a Belgian Doc,
named Einthoven.

71
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:23,463
He's dead.

72
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:27,556
While he was alive,
he invented a little ditty
called the Galvanometer.

73
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,674
Where do we get one?

74
00:04:28,756 --> 00:04:32,411
Go to any electronics store
that's been open since before 1905.

75
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,367
There's a good chance they got one
in the corner in the basement.

76
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:40,237
We need an audio/visual  setup for the lecture hall.

77
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:42,134
- What for?
- For the lecture.

78
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,889
- What lecture?
- Dr. Weber's lecture.

79
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:48,818
- Who's Dr. Weber?
- Uh, neurologist, I think.

80
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:50,740
The memo was from you.

81
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:59,613
- Where's my assistant?
- She left.

82
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:00,810
- When?
- Wednesday.

83
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:04,355
- Seriously?
- The temp agency sent someone,
but she got lost.

84
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:07,432
Well, when she gets here,
fire her.

85
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,444
Oh, yeah.

86
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,052
Did you issue this memo?

87
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,465
Look at that.

88
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,293
Congratulations.

89
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,137
The patient that has been
in a coma for two years and
counting is still in a coma.

90
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:40,891
This is not my signature.

91
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,088
I don't know
anything about this guy.
I'm supposed to introduce him?

92
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:45,487
Have lunch?

93
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:47,118
[Monitor bleeping]

94
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:49,208
The  coma patient
has a migraine?

95
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,248
Oh, no, no, no.

96
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:52,635
No, I gave him medication
to prevent a migraine.

97
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,494
That's a migraine.
Increased flow velocity
in his cerebral arteries.

98
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:59,204
I did, subsequently,
give him nitroglycerin,
which could possibly--

99
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:03,554
You induced
a migraine headache
in a coma patient?

100
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:05,164
I gave him
a little headache.

101
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:07,217
Similar to the one
you're giving me now.

102
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,905
Have you even read
an ethical guideline?

103
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:15,296
Well,  it'd be wrong to try out
a new migraine prevention medication
on someone who can actually feel pain.

104
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:16,543
Did you sign this?

105
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,568
Uh...yeah.

106
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:22,839
We can talk later about
the appropriate discipline.

107
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,197
Because of the burn, we can't
perform any of our normal tests
to see what's wrong.

108
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:32,522
So we're going to
try a Galvanometer.

109
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:36,615
It picks up a pulse
in the wrists and the ankles.

110
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:39,980
Hopefully it will tell us
why his heart rhythm is abnormal.

111
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:41,841
What have I done to him. I--

112
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,500
It was an accident.

113
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,868
All right, so...

114
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:50,476
he's got all these burns.
And now there's something
wrong with his heart?

115
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,210
We're trying to figure out
if the two are somehow connected.

116
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,376
Had  he been sick lately?

117
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,492
No, nothing.

118
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:59,288
Anything unusual
with his behavior?
Had he been tired a lot?

119
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:01,361
- Nothing.
- He was great. He was happy.

120
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,957
He was just having
a great time and then--

121
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:07,840
If he was experimenting
with amphetamines or cocaine--

122
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:08,786
No.

123
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,372
We gave him some pot
about a year ago to try.

124
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:13,497
It was just once.

125
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:17,947
We thought if we took the mystery
out of drugs and alcohol,
the less he'd experiment.

126
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:19,872
We'll know more after the tests.

127
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,906
It looks like they're gonna
electrocute him.

128
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:27,411
Plug it in.

129
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:30,848
You plug it in.

130
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,379
Fine. Gimme the cord.

131
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:41,517
Works.

132
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,431
Prominent U-waves.

133
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:46,860
No inverted T-wave.

134
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:48,439
No ischemia.

135
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:50,152
Q-wave normal.

136
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,551
That's not good.

137
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:57,668
Chase, turn it off.

138
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:58,773
Turn it off!

139
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,587
- What's happening?
- What is that?

140
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,734
He's seizing, get in here.

141
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,029
Who electrocuted my patient?

142
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,911
- He had a seizure.
- He wasn't electrocuted.

143
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,418
What does the seizure tell us?

144
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:16,864
Move.

145
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:18,035
What are you looking for?

146
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,884
Same as you.
Love, acceptance.
Solid return on investments.

147
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,518
Differential diagnosis.
Go.

148
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,547
Could be epilepsy,
or seizure disorder.

149
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,120
Not with the tachycardia.

150
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,034
It could be a virus in his brain.

151
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,936
Specificity's impressive.

152
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,061
Adrenoleukodystrophy.

153
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:37,039
Could be M.S.,
seizures could be caused
by plaques and lesions on the brain.

154
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:39,646
Well, let's find out which.
Get him an MRI.

155
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,364
No nuclear imaging.

156
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:44,960
He wouldn't survive
the move to Radiology.

157
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:47,185
MRI and CT scan are both out.

158
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:52,287
Okay. Lumbar puncture'll tell us
if his proteins are elevated.
At least we can exclude M.S.

159
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,326
Can't do a lumbar puncture either.

160
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:58,093
You're cramping my exits.

161
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,144
Don't tell me,
no skin on his spine.

162
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,020
We'd be inserting
a needle into an area
that's teeming with bacteria.

163
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:05,771
If he doesn't have
a brain infection already,
we'd give him one for sure.

164
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,037
There's no other way
to look at a brain.

165
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,980
Transcranial Doppler Sonography.

166
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:16,159
She said brain,
not pregnant woman's uterus.
They do sound alike.

167
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:17,828
I used one to look at
a brain this morning.

168
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:20,539
Why didn't you take the patient
to Radiology, get an MRA?

169
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,894
Obviously, I was
doing something illegal,

170
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,239
and using nuclear imaging
would've raised questions.

171
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,115
You're not gonna get
a diagnosis of M.S. from a sonogram.

172
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:33,179
Not definitively, but patients with M.S.
have more reactive neurons
in their occipital cortex.

173
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:38,603
Okay, then?

174
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:46,857
Thank you for all
coming to today's lecture
by Dr. Phillip Weber,

175
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:53,848
who is our guest today
at our hospital to talk
about headaches.

176
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:58,090
Dr. Weber is
at the Weber Center for Pain.
That makes sense.

177
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:01,663
Weber-Weber, um.
So please welcome, Dr. Weber.

178
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:12,424
Thank you, Doctor...Cuddy.

179
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:18,172
I suppose I should tell you
a little bit more about myself.

180
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,267
I went to school in Virginia,

181
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,182
You've never to one of
these things in your life.
Who is this guy?

182
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:26,982
No idea.

183
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,576
What's with the outfit?

184
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:33,363
Sudden chills,
and light sensitivity.

185
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,046
Inexplicable.

186
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:39,269
I received my medical degree
at Johns Hopkins University,

187
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,442
where I studied under
Brightman and Gilmar.

188
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:45,791
Hmm...he must be good.
You went to Hopkins

189
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,556
and studied under
Brightman and Gilmar.

190
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:49,213
Shh...

191
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:52,633
...helped me win
the Doyle internship
at the Mayo clinic.

192
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:55,561
You were supposed to
get the Doyle internship.

193
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,182
This guy's Von Lieberman?

194
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:01,873
The guy got you
thrown out for cheating?

195
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:03,817
The Dean threw me out.

196
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:05,788
Von Lieberman just ratted on me.

197
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,868
This guy's name is Weber,
not Von Lieberman.

198
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:09,870
I call Weber Von Lieberman.

199
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:12,346
Way eviler. Shh...

200
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:18,045
...and five HT Sub 1D receptors
have improved the acute
treatment of migraines.

201
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,026
To this point...

202
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:21,863
So what's the plan?

203
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,882
You wanna wait 'til he bends over
and make a fart sound?

204
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,017
I'm not here about the past.

205
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,224
He's a bad scientist.

206
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:34,143
Well, you cheated off him,
how bad can he be?

207
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:37,233
He got the answer wrong.

208
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,724
Doug:
Are they trying to wake him up?

209
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:48,891
They can't do that, right?
He'll be in too much pain.

210
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,030
Don't worry, he's still under.

211
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:54,481
But the brain never completely
sleeps, it's always working.

212
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:58,460
Controlling your heart rate.
Breathing. Temperature.

213
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:01,406
Cameron:
The eyes respond
to visual stimuli.

214
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,541
Blood flow increases
in certain areas of the brain and
we can track that with a sonogram.

215
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:10,670
With M.S., blood vessels are
more reactive, so flow is faster.

216
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:12,960
If Adam has an infection,

217
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:15,430
there'd be swelling which
would constrict the arteries,

218
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,429
and the flow would be slower.

219
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:21,313
Chase, near the subarachnoid space.

220
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:25,241
[Monitor bleeping]

221
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:34,427
Data from control subjects were analyzed
with a two-way ANOVA with status
and side as within-subject factors.

222
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,635
You stalked this guy for 20 years
just for the shot to humiliate him?

223
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,394
Shh. I'm trying to learn.

224
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,713
...vessels without significant rebound.

225
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,851
He doesn't even know
what that means.

226
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,033
You're going to
interrupt him, aren't you?

227
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:49,569
If I have a question.

228
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:51,448
And what's that
going to accomplish?

229
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:53,847
Why can't you just enjoy this?

230
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:55,598
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

231
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:59,963
You have got to find
less debilitating outlets
than humiliating people.

232
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:03,817
I hear bowling is
more fun than stalking.

233
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:05,420
But I'm better at this.

234
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:08,186
If P is less than point zero...

235
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,864
Blow a ton of money
on a plasma TV.

236
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:14,368
We found a subarachnoid bleed.

237
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,140
Bleed in the head
isn't causing seizures.

238
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:21,526
It could be. 10% with damage
to the cerebral cortex have seizures.

239
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,171
Or bacterial meningitis.

240
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:24,331
Viral encephalitis?

241
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:25,446
There's no way
to tell without--

242
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,901
Shut up!

243
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,413
Excuse me?

244
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:31,703
Not you.

245
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,382
If my lecture is interrupting
your meeting, I can wait.

246
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:37,372
[Says something in Hindi]

247
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,644
As your people say in India.
Appreciate it.

248
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,386
We'll figure out why later.
Um, fix the bleed, or he dies.

249
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,990
Talk to you
in a couple of hours.

250
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:51,983
De-re-maki.

251
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:03,667
I'm in the subarachnoid space.

252
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,107
Can you get it?

253
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:07,438
I think so.

254
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:11,748
Put the probe back where
it was so I can see the wire.

255
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,556
- We're looking for the bleed--
- Look when I get there!

256
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,418
I'm flying blind
without a contrast CT here.

257
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:30,907
And with a p value of less than .001,

258
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:37,669
we have strong statistical evidence that
this drug prevents migraine headaches
without daily administration.

259
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:39,959
Uh, excuse me, Doctor.

260
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:41,746
He knows this field
better than you do.

261
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,019
It's always been
my understanding that, uh,

262
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:47,960
unless you follow a daily regimen,
no drug can prevent a migraine.

263
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,754
That's why they call it
a breakthrough.

264
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,821
That's why YOU call it
a breakthrough.

265
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,798
No, the, uh, pharmaceutical company
sponsoring my clinical trials
also hails it as a breakthrough.

266
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,649
I'm sure your wife
and lawyer do too.

267
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,636
Is there anybody who doesn't
stand to make a fortune from it,
calling it a breakthrough?

268
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:06,594
Who are you?

269
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:09,476
Just a lunatic who
desperately needs a hobby.

270
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:11,459
How exactly do
these studies work?

271
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,419
Do you give this drug
to a bunch of people and

272
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:16,856
they don't get a migraine,
you go, voila, my drug works?

273
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,902
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

274
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:21,135
Uh,  do you have cancer?

275
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:25,800
Wow. Mango juice
prevents cancer.

276
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,000
Perhaps I should've
taken my medication
before this lecture.

277
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:31,359
[Roars with laughter]

278
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:33,852
Dr. Weber:
We had a very
specific control group.

279
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,818
Chronic migraine sufferers.

280
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:37,774
I don't have time to go through
all the math right now,

281
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:41,781
- but the incidence was dramatically--
- Sure, in India.

282
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,687
Two plus two
equals five there, right?

283
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:46,937
Do I know you?

284
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:49,159
I know your math skills.

285
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:50,836
They blow.

286
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:52,296
Touché.

287
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,267
You sound very familiar.

288
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,222
Why did you publish it
in an obscure journal in India?

289
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,916
Why not publish in Really Really
Cool Head Cases of South Philly?

290
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:04,556
Neuroscience New Delhi
is a respected journal.

291
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,312
Yeah, the guy running
Slurp 'N' Gulp tells me
it's one of the best.

292
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:10,072
Get a hooker.
Anything.

293
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:11,800
See, I'm thinking that

294
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:16,783
publishing studies is
probably the easiest way
to get a pharmaceutical company
to give you a reach-around.

295
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:21,083
And choosing a journal that
no one can actually read,
well, that's, that's shrewd.

296
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:22,807
I know I know you.

297
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:24,169
Sure  you do.

298
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,400
Dick.

299
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,629
The name's Philip.

300
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,126
Oh, my bad.

301
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,784
Something to do
with your face.

302
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:31,772
I always think
your name is Dick.

303
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:33,395
House?

304
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,739
Here.

305
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:38,127
Medical school was 20 years ago.

306
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:39,913
Give it a rest, grow up.

307
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:43,413
Yeah, you were
always the grown-up,
do the responsible thing.

308
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,014
Tattletale.

309
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,214
- You cheated.
- I cheated then,
you're cheating now.

310
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,433
Your drug doesn't work.

311
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:52,744
Oh, yes, you would like to believe that,
because it plays right into your fantasy--

312
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:54,854
- I tested it.
- Oh, really?

313
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:57,415
What are your parameters?
Where's your study?

314
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:02,435
Room 2134.

315
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:03,572
One patient?

316
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:05,254
The coma patient?

317
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,961
You haven't changed a bit.

318
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:12,962
You took short cuts in med school,
you're taking short cuts now.

319
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,345
You cannot test this
on an abnormal brain.

320
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:20,379
That's so closed-minded.
He's not abnormal, he's special.

321
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:24,342
Cerebral cortex atrophies
in coma patients.

322
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:28,832
You need live,
conscious people.

323
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,996
You don't know
everything, House.

324
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:41,218
It's something that
disrupts brain function.

325
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:45,045
Plaques are perfect.
Interrupt neuronal communication.

326
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,328
-  M.S.?
- No.

327
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:50,996
M.S. is complicated.
I think this is more basic.
It's just tachycardia and seizures.

328
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:54,302
How much longer
the burn unit guys gonna
keep him in that thing?

329
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:57,209
Lecture's over. Let's go.
House wants to...

330
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,872
Adam's waking up.

331
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:04,305
Get the anesthesiologist
in here now.

332
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:05,849
Cameron:
He's in pain.

333
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,922
That's not pain.

334
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,605
Need some help in here.

335
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,533
[Gasps for air]

336
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:15,529
Adam had an orgasm.

337
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:18,273
What?

338
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:20,023
You mean while he was--

339
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,334
Oh!

340
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,286
God!

341
00:19:26,585 --> 00:19:27,819
What's wrong?

342
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:31,678
I'm having a migraine.

343
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,367
Are you okay?

344
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:36,291
Uh, yes.

345
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,882
I was right.

346
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:42,878
Oh!

347
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,318
We'll knock you out
for a couple of hours.

348
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:54,227
No, I got work to do.

349
00:19:54,458 --> 00:20:00,108
Just gimme sumatriptan
for the pain and verapamil
so it doesn't recur.

350
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,144
I heard the patient had fun
in the hyperbaric chamber.

351
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,227
Yeah.

352
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,593
Gotta schedule me
some time in there.

353
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:16,204
Weber's meds aren't
even legal in the U.S.

354
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,351
It's legal in India.

355
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,887
I was disoriented.

356
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:29,847
Um, moving around
is a bad idea.

357
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:32,676
Hey, if you feel chest pain,
you need to let me know.

358
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,396
Verapamil can cause
congestive heart failure.

359
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,447
Nothing can hurt my heart.

360
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:43,631
Foreman:
Hey, you're gonna
feel some dizziness.

361
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,846
Definitely gonna be constipated.

362
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:54,302
Differential diagnosis
for getting off.

363
00:20:54,512 --> 00:20:55,579
Is he gonna be okay?

364
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:58,021
No, something's seriously
wrong with him.

365
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:03,521
Differential diagnosis
for ejaculation.

366
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,506
Don't make me say it again.

367
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:08,779
We're not stalling,
we just don't know.

368
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:10,348
Then guess.

369
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,155
Could pain medication
cause an orgasm?

370
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:13,965
I wish.

371
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:15,729
Maybe pain
caused the orgasm.

372
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:19,667
You get a tattoo,
the brain releases endorphins
which create pleasure.

373
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:22,109
Most people don't orgasm
from a needle prick.

374
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,768
Well, Chase has a point.

375
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:27,867
The brain is like
a huge train station.
If the switches--

376
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:30,132
Ow.

377
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,884
You're the neurologist,
talk for me.

378
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:37,037
If sensory information
got misinterpreted by
the medial forebrain bundle,

379
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:40,046
it's possible
for bad to feel good
and good to feel bad.

380
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:43,805
He's a lucky kid.
Let's not fix him
until the burns heal.

381
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,826
So what attacks
the medial forebrain bundle?

382
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,249
Infective neuropathies.
Vasculitic neuropathies.

383
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,631
Krabbe's disease,
metachromatic leukodystrophy.

384
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:53,233
House:
All very bad things.

385
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,065
No way to look for
any of them in his condition.

386
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:57,411
Could be an infection.

387
00:21:57,473 --> 00:21:59,239
I said infection
about eight seconds ago.

388
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:00,872
You listed some
brain infections.

389
00:22:01,323 --> 00:22:05,803
But what if it's just
a regular old infection
festering in the burned skin?

390
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:08,492
Pus on his arm isn't causing
problems in the forebrain.

391
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:13,805
He's on 20 different medications
to manage his pain, his heart,
how often he urinates.

392
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:16,690
His brain is like a waiter
that's got too many--

393
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:17,588
Hey, hey.

394
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:19,569
I do the metaphors.

395
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:23,004
The brain is stressed.

396
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:25,019
An infection elsewhere
could put it over the edge.

397
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,054
So we just wait for his burns
to heal to see if you're right?

398
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,924
If you're wrong, he doesn't
have that kind of time.

399
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:35,249
Dominic Larrey.

400
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,194
He another dead doctor?

401
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:40,499
He was Napoleon's Surgeon in Chief.

402
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,115
Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.

403
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,430
By amputating legs.

404
00:22:43,581 --> 00:22:45,668
And with bugs.

405
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:52,869
Cameron:
Maggots are implanted
directly into Adam's burns.

406
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:57,093
Maggots--eat dead people. I--

407
00:22:57,177 --> 00:23:01,006
Maggots eat dead flesh.
Only dead flesh.

408
00:23:01,195 --> 00:23:03,644
So they're perfectly suited to clean wounds.

409
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,633
They also kill the bacteria
that thrive in injured tissues.

410
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,443
Ho!

411
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:49,058
Dr. Jekyll, I presume, they found
a half-eaten sheep in the zoo.

412
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:50,773
The police want to
ask you a few questions.

413
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:52,435
I need something to wash it down.

414
00:23:52,852 --> 00:23:56,485
Coffee? Bad idea.
You're better off with water!

415
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:58,272
Coffee's closer.

416
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:01,891
Foolproof plan, by the way.

417
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:03,698
Either his meds would work,

418
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:08,673
and you'd be in psychic pain,
because Von Evil is gonna be rich.

419
00:24:09,635 --> 00:24:13,642
Or they wouldn't, and
you get to be in agony all day.

420
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,354
Perfect lose/lose situation.
Very you.

421
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:18,758
I had to prove--

422
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:20,353
You proved nothing.

423
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:23,685
Right.

424
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,002
This isn't a migraine.

425
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:31,361
Yeah, Dear New England Journal of Medicine,
I took this guy's drug,
and still got a headache.

426
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:34,954
Thus scientifically proving that my arch enemy is an idiot.

427
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,348
You just wanted the pain.

428
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:39,647
The meds are supposed
to prevent migraine.

429
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:44,207
You get distracted by pain.
Leaves less room for the things
you don't wanna think about.

430
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:47,965
Like the Flyers sucking,
or the price of gas, or,

431
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:51,215
oh, the fact that you pushed
the love of your life out of your life.

432
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:54,182
God, I wish
the pain would go away.

433
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:57,202
Next time you need to
get your mind off her,
stick a needle in your eye.

434
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:59,755
It's less annoying to the rest of us
when you can still walk.

435
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:09,896
Did you sleep here?

436
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:15,332
Lower.

437
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,642
Do you want a pillow?

438
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:20,630
Not softer, lower.

439
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,343
The frequency of your voice is grating.

440
00:25:23,427 --> 00:25:25,124
You should've been better by now.

441
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,683
I'm super.

442
00:25:27,203 --> 00:25:28,380
The patient?

443
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,762
The maggots did great for the burn.

444
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,790
But the brainwaves are
still all over the map.

445
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:38,095
Which means your regular old infection
isn't causing his brain dysfunction.

446
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:42,464
Which means there's an underlying condition.
Which means we gotta get inside his head.

447
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,495
Do a lumbar puncture.

448
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:46,868
We've already established
that we can't get a lumbar--

449
00:25:46,952 --> 00:25:48,989
C2, C3.

450
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:51,818
No, no, no way.

451
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:55,134
I only saw a cervical tap once,
and that guy got paralyzed.

452
00:25:55,371 --> 00:26:00,274
Ask the parents
if they prefer to have their son
in a wheelchair, or dead.

453
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:06,928
Something's causing
his brain to lose control.

454
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,099
Eventually it will shut off.

455
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:13,681
We need to do a lumbar puncture
to get some of the fluid in his spine
so we can test it.

456
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:15,693
You need us to sign a consent?

457
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:17,453
I have to warn you.

458
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:21,269
There's a serious risk of
paralysis or death.

459
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:23,556
Are you saying
we shouldn't do this?

460
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:25,404
You have to do this.

461
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:27,436
Then why are you telling us
what can go wrong?

462
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,624
I just think you should know.

463
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:32,410
Either you're cruel or this clipboard
is a way for you to cover your ass
in case you cripple our son.

464
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:34,868
- This isn't his fault--
- No, it's not, it's yours.

465
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:36,458
That's what you
keep telling me.

466
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:40,757
My son is lying in there
half dead. I am just trying to
find a way to get through this.

467
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:44,251
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I know.

468
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,627
Needle.

469
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:22,505
- It's not going in.
- Don't force it.

470
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,396
I'm going one space higher.

471
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,070
It's too close to his brain stem,
it'll herniate.

472
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,982
- You're gonna paralyze him.
- Not helping.

473
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,191
[Monitars start beeping]

474
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:32,998
His blood pressure's spiking.
Stop.

475
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:33,776
I can get it.

476
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:36,591
He's 180 over 120.
He's gonna stroke.

477
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:40,447
I'm in the space.
Gimme the vial.

478
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:53,524
[Monitars stops beeping
and go back to normal]

479
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:00,606
He doesn't have M.S.
or an infection.

480
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:04,702
His proteins aren't elevated?

481
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:07,860
Wrong protein.
IgM, not IgG.

482
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:10,319
Elevation was probably
caused by the bleeding.

483
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:16,415
What if there was tingling
in his extremities prior
to the crash?

484
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,438
How can you still be on M.S.?

485
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:20,089
You gotta be on something.

486
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:24,763
Something's interrupting
his neurons' chit-chat.
Like lesions.

487
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:26,527
We can't scan for them.

488
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,668
Only test we can do we just did,
and it was negative.

489
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:31,967
He has no tingling,
no numbness.

490
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:34,570
You read his history.
Parents didn't say anything about--

491
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:36,227
What about Adam?

492
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:40,829
We can't look into his brain,
but you want us to read his mind?

493
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:43,831
Good point.

494
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:55,855
Yeah, you can finish
the sponge bath in a minute.

495
00:28:55,939 --> 00:28:57,756
They're just redoing his dressings.

496
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:59,357
He's out, he's fine.

497
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:02,913
I didn't page you to put him out,
I paged you to wake him up.

498
00:29:03,314 --> 00:29:05,467
Why are these lights
so damn bright?

499
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,608
Thank you.

500
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:09,633
Come on, I need to talk to him.

501
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:12,600
House, you can't
wake up a burn victim
to play 20 Questions.

502
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,547
- It's torture.
- He won't remember.

503
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:16,392
He's gonna be
in extraordinary pain--

504
00:29:16,476 --> 00:29:19,184
God, you're good.
You're putting me to sleep.

505
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:24,541
I know he's gonna be in pain,
I know you disapprove,
I'm his attending, wake him up.

506
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:45,227
Mmm...Oh, my God.

507
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,719
I'm Dr. House.

508
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:47,987
It hurts!

509
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:50,166
It's gonna get a lot worse,
so answer fast.

510
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,609
Before the accident,
did you experience any numbness
or any tingling in your fingers?

511
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:57,311
You got burnt, it's healing,
I need an answer.

512
00:29:57,368 --> 00:29:58,670
Ow! It really hurts!

513
00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,990
Any tingling in your arms or legs?

514
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:02,311
Do something! I can't--

515
00:30:02,373 --> 00:30:05,249
Adam, you gotta listen to me.
Did you feel anything?

516
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:12,429
I pissed my pants
and then I don't...remember--

517
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,692
Ahh! Ahhhh!

518
00:30:51,274 --> 00:30:52,506
Is he okay?

519
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,430
Get everyone in my office.

520
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:56,419
Where are you going?

521
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:59,111
Kid's screaming
gave me a headache.

522
00:30:59,282 --> 00:31:00,907
I gotta take an aspirin.

523
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,135
House.

524
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:03,539
You okay?
We've been waiting for you.

525
00:32:07,944 --> 00:32:10,281
I'm hallucinating.

526
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:15,760
Hallucinations with migraines
are pretty uncommon.

527
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,501
What'd you see?

528
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:20,652
I saw music.

529
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:24,015
Sensory deception
makes no sense.

530
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:25,382
Shh...

531
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:31,498
You took something.
[Sounds hollow]

532
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:34,548
The kid's fighting for his life.

533
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:41,235
<i># Get miles away #</i>

534
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:44,342
<i># Get miles away #</i>

535
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:47,101
<i># Get miles away #</i>

536
00:32:47,495 --> 00:32:50,158
<i># Get miles away #</i>

537
00:32:50,444 --> 00:32:53,126
<i># Get miles away #</i>

538
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:56,091
<i># Get miles away #</i>

539
00:32:56,297 --> 00:32:59,081
<i># Get miles #</i>

540
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:04,680
Hey, you find him?

541
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,727
He was hallucinating
in the locker room.

542
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,440
He okay?

543
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,323
He's feeling no pain,
he's high.

544
00:33:10,385 --> 00:33:11,720
Vicodin high?

545
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:14,269
Past that.
He's seeing sounds.

546
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:15,918
Took something.

547
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:21,820
Why is it so dark in here?
Beautiful day outside.

548
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:24,432
Open the shades.
Let the sunshine in.

549
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:26,199
It's nighttime.

550
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:29,262
It's still Tuesday, right?

551
00:33:29,329 --> 00:33:30,442
You look better.

552
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,299
I took something.

553
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,031
Mind if I ask what?

554
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:37,340
Uh, little of this,
little of that.

555
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:39,484
I know what's wrong
with our patient.

556
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:41,212
He's depressed.

557
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:43,018
- He told you that
when you woke him up?
- No,

558
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,861
he told me he pissed his pants
and blacked out.

559
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:46,555
That's not a diagnostic
of depression.

560
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:47,999
Lack of appetite.
Isolating yourself--

561
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:51,438
Uncontrollable urination
and blacking out are
good predictors of what?

562
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:52,141
Seizure.

563
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:56,093
Which means the seizure he had
when you tested his heart was
at least his second seizure.

564
00:33:56,177 --> 00:33:59,025
So what?
Depression and seizures
aren't correlated.

565
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:01,162
No, but you know what is?

566
00:34:01,502 --> 00:34:04,120
Depression and
anti-depression medicine.

567
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:05,604
Tox screen was clean.

568
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:09,277
Yeah, but you know how much crap
he's got in his system for
dealing with those burns.

569
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:13,246
The guy could have the Spanish Armada
floating through his bloodstream,
we wouldn't know about it,

570
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:14,918
'til they started firing cannons.

571
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:18,683
Antidepressants have been
known to cause seizures in kids,
but not orgasms.

572
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:19,894
This is a brain in trouble.

573
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:22,912
This is a brain with
too much serotonin.

574
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:26,816
Serotonin affects mood,
appetite. It doesn't cause
a brain to shut down.

575
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:31,365
Antidepressants fake brains into
thinking they have more serotonin
than they actually do.

576
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:35,056
Every 10 million or so cases,
it sets off a chain reaction.

577
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:37,950
It produces too much,
enough to fry itself.

578
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:40,369
If Adam has
Serotonin Storm,
it's deadly.

579
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,588
But treatable.
Cyproheptadine.

580
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,380
Unless he doesn't have
Serotonin Storm.

581
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:46,767
He could just as easily have
too much dopamine as serotonin.

582
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,609
But if it's dopamine,
the cyproheptadine will kill him.

583
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:51,451
Where are you going?

584
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:53,676
I'm gonna
talk to the kid again.
Seems nice.

585
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:54,722
You can't.

586
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,953
Why? Did he say
he doesn't like me?

587
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:59,521
The anesthesiologist told
the parents what you did.

588
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,286
Everyone's a tattletale.

589
00:35:08,728 --> 00:35:10,665
Is your son depressed?

590
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,511
No, who are you?

591
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:14,707
I'm Dr. House.

592
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:15,667
Oh, you're the idiot who--

593
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:17,713
I heard him screaming
all the way down the hallway.

594
00:35:17,797 --> 00:35:20,276
If I didn't wake him up,
I wouldn't have learned
what caused the crash.

595
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:21,996
I think he had a seizure.

596
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:27,261
Th-this wasn't my fault?

597
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:31,767
Well, if he hadn't had
the brain problem,
he wouldn't have the burns.

598
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:35,072
On the other hand,
if you hadn't put him on the ATV,
he also wouldn't have the burns.

599
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:37,506
You can debate
your personal responsibility
after I leave.

600
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,838
I need to wake him up again.

601
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:41,158
I need to know if he's
taking anti-depressants.

602
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:42,307
He's not.

603
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,686
He's the happiest kid I know.

604
00:35:44,745 --> 00:35:46,308
But you don't know, do you?

605
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:50,176
He's my son.

606
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,586
Mmm, that's sort of my point.

607
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:55,133
At 16, they'll tell
anyone anything.

608
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:56,396
Except their parents.

609
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,942
Adam talks to us about everything.

610
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:00,255
Yeah, I know about
the pot and the cocaine.

611
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:02,987
- There was never cocaine--
- You sure?

612
00:36:03,316 --> 00:36:04,997
You having him followed?

613
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:07,868
He told us when
he got drunk at a party.

614
00:36:07,937 --> 00:36:09,849
He told us when
he started having sex.

615
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:11,656
16, way to go.

616
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,197
He told us when
he cheated on a math test.

617
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:15,576
He told us when
his girlfriend cheated on him.

618
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,310
He doesn't hide
anything from us.

619
00:36:17,394 --> 00:36:19,945
- But if he was depressed?
- He'd tell us.

620
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:23,158
We don't judge.
He's not depressed,
we're sure.

621
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:25,735
"Bet his life on it" sure?

622
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,797
Just hypothetically.

623
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:31,736
Yeah.

624
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:36,837
Okay.

625
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:40,755
Kid's happy.

626
00:36:41,648 --> 00:36:43,693
Happy, happy, happy.

627
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:46,845
Then we're back to
where we started,
seizure disorders.

628
00:36:47,362 --> 00:36:50,312
Seizure disorders aren't
causing orgasms.

629
00:36:50,396 --> 00:36:51,987
Vascular malformations.

630
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:54,085
Would've seen it
on the sonogram.

631
00:36:54,187 --> 00:36:55,854
Hepatic encephalopathy?

632
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:58,629
Liver enzyme tests were normal.

633
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:05,655
Where are you going?

634
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:07,209
Take a leak.

635
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:16,131
What are you doing?

636
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:17,385
Can't come in here.

637
00:37:17,553 --> 00:37:18,247
You're not sterile.

638
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:19,506
Don't touch our son,
we told you.

639
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,387
Seriously,
millions of bacteria,
microbes on you.

640
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,532
He'll die of sepsis.

641
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,183
If you go in there...

642
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:30,821
I think he's gonna wake him up again.

643
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:32,347
I know he is.

644
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:36,109
House, you can't do this.

645
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:39,302
Oh, if I had a nickel
for every time I've heard that.

646
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:41,667
Relax. They gonna sue us?

647
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:44,010
If I'm right,
I save his life.

648
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:47,233
If I'm wrong,
he's dead no matter what I do.

649
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:49,430
Either way, how much
have I really hurt them?

650
00:37:50,245 --> 00:37:51,804
Leave him alone!

651
00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:53,806
You're not sterile.
You wanna kill the kid?

652
00:37:54,224 --> 00:37:55,192
Give me the syringe.

653
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:58,542
- No pain, no gain.
- Hey, you gotta stop this.

654
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:03,646
You're right.

655
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:07,344
- He's not depressed.
- Yeah, sure.

656
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,147
I'm not letting you go
until you give me that syringe.

657
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:11,898
What's that on his wrist?

658
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,445
A burn.

659
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:16,831
- Why on his wrist?
- Why not on his wrist?

660
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:20,856
His back, his torso,
everything's a mess.
His forearms are clean.

661
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,147
Except right there.

662
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,425
So what?

663
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:25,954
It's a perfect circle.

664
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,990
So a drop of burning gasoline
fell on his wrist.
A screw from the ATV.

665
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,364
Maybe.

666
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,778
Why are you torturing him?

667
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:45,421
Does your son smoke?

668
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:47,880
I'd kill him.

669
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:52,694
So he talked to you
about sex, crack.

670
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:54,622
Anything except cigarettes.

671
00:38:55,618 --> 00:38:58,066
He has a cigarette burn
on his wrist.

672
00:38:58,723 --> 00:39:02,433
Also a fading nicotine stain
between two fingers.

673
00:39:02,732 --> 00:39:05,929
Bad news, you son has
a filthy, unhealthy habit.

674
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,398
Good news,
he's trying to quit.

675
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:10,650
Bad news,
the quitting's killing him.

676
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:12,364
Good news,
I can cure him.

677
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:13,691
Bad news...

678
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:16,641
nope, that's the end of it.

679
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,068
Quitting smoking can kill?

680
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,634
No-smoke meds are
anti-depressants.

681
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,843
The crappy ones
you get over the Internet.

682
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:26,555
They're loaded with
whatever anti-depressants
they can get cheap.

683
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:29,919
Since Mommy and Daddy
obviously didn't take him
to a pediatrician...

684
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,003
Sorry, I was wrong
about him being depressed.

685
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:38,044
Treat him.

686
00:39:56,368 --> 00:39:57,835
Cuddy:
Hey.

687
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:01,367
Did you drop acid?

688
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:03,977
Why would I do that?

689
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:05,352
To annoy me.

690
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:07,803
Or maybe because
you're miserable.

691
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:11,418
Or because you
wanna self-destruct.

692
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:12,761
Pick one.

693
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:19,801
How 'bout because LSD acts
on serotonin receptors in the brain,
which can stop a migraine in its tracks.

694
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:23,068
I'm just saying
it's also a possibility.

695
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:25,967
- How did you know--
- Cameron is worried about you.

696
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:30,446
I told her that
LSD lasts up to 12 hours.
If you were functional,
she must be wrong.

697
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:35,714
Either that, or I also took
a whole bunch of anti-depressants,
which short-circuited the LSD.

698
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:37,436
I'm just saying
that would also explain it.

699
00:40:37,622 --> 00:40:40,045
Thank you for
ruining my clinical trials.

700
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:42,111
Pharmaceutical company's
shutting me down.

701
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,201
You're kidding, really?

702
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:44,252
How could that surprise you?

703
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,658
You sent them an email
complaining about my math.

704
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:48,159
Telling them about your stunt.

705
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:50,517
I didn't know
people actually read emails.

706
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:52,405
Delete button is
so conveniently located--

707
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:53,264
So what's next?

708
00:40:53,413 --> 00:40:55,782
You gonna follow me
my whole life, torture me?

709
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:56,808
Why would I do that?

710
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,425
You waited 20 years to do this.

711
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,821
What's next?
Break up my marriage?

712
00:41:01,861 --> 00:41:04,279
No. We're even.

713
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:05,564
Right.

714
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:09,886
Oh, thanks for
setting me up.

715
00:41:13,146 --> 00:41:16,523
Eye for an eye,
LSD, and antidepressants,

716
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:19,193
everything in balance.

717
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:23,987
Buddhists call it Karma,
Christians call it the Golden Rule,
Jews call it...

718
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:26,575
I don't know.

719
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,326
Rabbi Hillel said
something poignant.

720
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:33,455
Universe always
settles the score.

721
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:34,977
Does it?

722
00:41:35,848 --> 00:41:36,729
No.

723
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,901
But it should.

724
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,718
Do you think you'll ever
be able to look at him
and not blame me?

725
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:56,009
Yeah. Will you?

726
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,458
[Knocking on the door]

727
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:48,598
I'm Paula.

728
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,277
Hey, Paula.

729
00:42:50,659 --> 00:42:51,915
How you doing?

730
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:56,088
You work over at the college?
Or are you full time over at--

731
00:42:56,144 --> 00:42:58,338
I'm looking
for a distraction.

732
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:02,044
You don't need to talk
to do that, do you?

733
