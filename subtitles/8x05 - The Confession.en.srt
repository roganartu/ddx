outstanding citizens.

8

Now, many of you
may recognize him

as coach Bob of our champion
little league team.

10
00:00:41,304 --> 00:00:43,037
And some of you may know him

of our harvest scholarship fund.

as the new dean of medicine,

36
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:52,882
I'd like to personally welcome
all of our new employees

do you want to come back?

He has no choice.
He's the boss now.

He has to be
professional.

48
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:18,710
He has to base
his decisions

49

He said he got them
playing flag football.

93

I'm sure that's true if "flag"
is a euphemism for "penis"

94
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:11,693
and "football" is a euphemism
for "entering a vagina."

see if you can get him
to go back into v-fib again.

108

another cardiac arrest.

Why would he do that?

I just mean the part about
the odds of it happening.

he pounces,

is the fact that other people

find a donor for anyone again.

524
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,339
Everybody doesn't lie,
cheat, or steal

525
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:55,443
from their friends.
Yeah, they do.

526
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:57,479
Maybe not as much
as this guy,

527
00:25:57,513 --> 00:25:59,780
<i>but if people told
nothing but the truth,</i>

528
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:02,336
the world would probably
burn down overnight.

529
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,866
Some people think
it's burning now.

530
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:06,878
Maybe if everybody
didn't lie...

531
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,760
<i>(House)
Aw, that is cute.</i>

532
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,406
I'm talking
about your breasts.

533
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:15,802
<i>They always get perky when
you're being painfully earnest.</i>

534
00:26:15,836 --> 00:26:17,506
Truth.

535
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:19,255
<i>It's uncomfortable,
isn't it?</i>

536
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:20,684
More truth... I only noticed

537
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,257
because Chase
was staring at them.

538
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:25,956
He'd never admit it, because
he doesn't want to offend you.

539
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:27,169
Same reason
he'd never tell you

540
00:26:27,214 --> 00:26:28,779
that he's thought
about having sex with you.

541
00:26:28,872 --> 00:26:30,680
<i>Although, to be fair,
every man you've ever met</i>

542
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:32,951
has thought
about having sex with you.

543
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:34,820
They'll lie,
because if you knew...

544
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:37,057
You probably wouldn't want
to have sex with them.

545
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:40,300
And that's just some of the lies
from the last minute.

546
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,668
And here's a bigger one...

547
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,823
you already kn this,
but you pretend you don't

548
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:47,104
because it makes you
feel civilized.

549
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:50,340
Most people find it easier
to ignore the truth.

550
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:52,059
Ask Taub.

551
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:54,755
Our patient can't wait
for a transplant

552
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:56,775
that's never gonna come.

553
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,515
We need to get reckless
and extreme.

<i>C.T. his liver,

<i>and cut it out.</i>

556
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:04,082
Hopefully, what's left
will be enough

557
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:06,807
so we can start treatment
with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

558
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,529
I'm sorry the first time
I had both of you together

559
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:16,704
I had to wk.

560
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:20,644

we call a jackass.

Good. Stay right there.

563

[Normal voice]
I'm also sorry...

00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,335
For what I'm about to do...

565
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,010
Because...

566
00:27:40,012 --> 00:27:45,628
Because nothing will ever change
how I feel about you guys.

567
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,295
But...
[Babies cooing]

568
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:03,276
But daddy is weak
and needs to know.

569
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:05,248
[Whispering]
Okay.

570
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,722
Just gonna put this
right here...Okay?

571
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:22,889
It's 3:30 in the morning.
Why are you still here?

572
00:28:22,923 --> 00:28:24,031
House is here

573
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:25,678
and apparently prepping
for an operation

574
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,017
that will probably
kill a patient.

575
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,975
I wouldn't be doing this if
I thought there was another way.

576
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:30,911
There is.
He needs a transplant.

577
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,906
You have one lying around?

578
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,693
'Cause he'll be dead
if he doesn't get one

579
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:35,927
in the next few hours.

580
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,941
That falls
under natural causes.

581
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:39,478
If you kill him, we're
looking at... dead is dead.

582
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:43,397
Not as far as our lawyers
are concerned.

583
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:45,027
I'm not being a dick.

584
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:46,506
This is a real issue,

585
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:48,781
and I have to worry
about the big picture now.

586
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:50,047
I don't.

587
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,704
I'll be doing what you
would have done a year ago.

588
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:54,531
I'll be in surgery.

589
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:57,100
<i>(Adams)
Chase...</i>

590
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,633
You need to check
this out.

591
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:02,775
This is a C.T. scan
of his liver

592

<i>from ten hours ago...</i>

593
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,133
This is from now.

594
00:29:07,135 --> 00:29:09,378
It's healing itself.

<i>(Taub)

597
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:18,731
he was telling her
about the strippers

00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:20,315
from his bachelor party.

<i>buys us a few extra days
before he'll need a transplant.</i>

601
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,172
Interesting question is,
why is it regenerating?

602
00:29:36,251 --> 00:29:38,093
And scene.

603
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:42,520
Now we're back
to boring reality reality.

604
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:44,356
His liver was in shock
before.

605
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,697
He's been having an allergic
reaction since he got here.

606
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:48,975
Could explain why his symptoms
appeared so rapidly.

607
00:29:48,977 --> 00:29:50,429
And maybe starting
to go away.

608
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,488
We need to run a scratch test
to find out what set it off.

609
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,224
Or who. This all started
when he cheated on his wife.

610
00:29:55,323 --> 00:29:57,655
He's allergic
to a person?

611
00:29:57,768 --> 00:30:00,592
Or something
she's wearing...

612
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:02,265
makeup, perfume,

613
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,122
birth control method,
her "Hello Kitty" doll.

614
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:07,385
Two of you go find her
and find out what.

615
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:09,784
Two of you start treatment
with corticosteroids

616
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:12,277
and epinephrine
while you run the scratch test.

617
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:18,293
You think
I did this to him?

618
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:21,118
Or something you wear,
own, use, or gave him.

619
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,173
I gave him a condom.
He didn't have one.

620
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,725
What kind?
I don't know what kind.

621
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:27,233
I got it from the health fair
I was working at.

622
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:29,577
You're in the medical profession?
I'm Miss Cedarville.

623
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:31,396
The health fair
is one of my responsibilities.

624
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:34,629
Is another one hooking up
with 38-year-old married men?

625
00:30:36,154 --> 00:30:38,988
I guess I'm supposed
to be the good cop.

626
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,095
I know this is tough.

627
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:46,638
But anything you can remember
might help save his life.

628
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:49,535
He was giving me
a ride home, and...

629
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:52,048
He always seemed
so nice.

630
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,351
And then we ended up
at the motel.

631
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:58,341
And now everybody's talking
about it.

632
00:30:58,376 --> 00:30:59,716
And if they find out
it was me,

633
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:02,415
I'm gonna lose my title
and probably my job.

634
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:06,785
And no one in town is ever
gonna speak to me again.

was gonna happen?

00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:19,391
I was sick
of living a lie.

Everybody loved me.
Everybody looked up to me.

641

broadcast all of them

This doesn't make any sense.

660
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:02,929
He broke out with a rash

661
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:04,736
right after I tested
with the wheat-allergy swab,

662
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:07,724
but none of his blood samples
show he's allergic to it.

663
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:09,047
Then he's not allergic to it.

664
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:11,393
Could the corticosteroids
have somehow caused it?

665
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:13,502
I didn't hook them up yet.
After he broke out,

666
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:16,047
I wanted to confirm it was
gluten before we dosed him.

667
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:17,538
Could be
a latex allergy.

668
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:18,930
Started with a condom,

669
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:21,033
and we kept it going
with our gloves and equipment.

670
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:23,061
He doesn't test positive
for that either.

671

None of his samples
test positive for anything.

672
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,553
Then he's allergic
to something not on the tests.

00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:46,066
the Corticosteroids
and Epinephrine

696
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,510
<i>would have made him better,
not worse.</i>

697
00:33:51,617 --> 00:33:53,780
Is everyone trying
to think of an answer?

698
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:58,128
Or is everyone afraid to say
what they think the answer is?

699
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:01,264
I take it you're in
the latter category.

700
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:04,593
Stevens-Johnson syndrome...

701
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,830
<i>it fits all of his symptoms
and exains</i>

702
00:34:06,895 --> 00:34:08,772
<i>why he got worse
after the steroids.</i>

703
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:11,631
Most medication
exacerbates the condition.

704
00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:13,275
There's no treatment
for it.

705
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:18,010
[Pen clicking]

706
00:34:18,044 --> 00:34:19,260
It fits.

707
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:22,289
<i>Case closed.</i>

708
00:34:22,316 --> 00:34:24,794
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

709
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:50,287
[Wheezing]

710
00:35:07,201 --> 00:35:10,819
[Wheezing]

711
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,802
I feel like I'm in hell.

712
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:17,396
We can't give you
too much pain medication,

713
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,914
or we'll make
your condition worse.

714
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,553
I got one final
confession to make.

715
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:29,936
What's left...

716
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,320
you cheated
on your taxes?

717
00:35:32,419 --> 00:35:36,214
I'm a murderer.

718
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:38,373
<i>I killed
my business partner.</i>

719
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:43,764
I shot him in the head.

720
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,668
I made it look like
suicide.

721
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:50,188
<i>And he was just
the first.</i>

722
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:52,337
You killed more?

723
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,170
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

724
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:56,988
Three...

725
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:01,598
Or four.

726
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:10,994
Try not to kill anyone else
until I get back.

727
00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:17,070
(Chase)
It's neurological.

728
00:36:17,104 --> 00:36:18,418
There's an aneurysm

729
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:20,573
in the anterior communicating
artery of his brain...

730
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:23,610
the area moderating
impulse control and compulsion.

731
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:24,745
<i>As it grew larger,</i>

732
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:27,175
so did the confessions.

733
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:29,214
Watch.

734
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,597
Bob, one of my shoes
is missing from my locker.

735
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:34,934
I'm so sorry.

736
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,419
<i>I... I needed the cash,
and, um,</i>

737
00:36:38,421 --> 00:36:39,752
<i>the locker was open.</i>

738
00:36:39,786 --> 00:36:41,377
I never heard
of a neurological problem

739
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:43,259
that causes someone's skin
to fall off.

740
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:46,649
Because there isn't one.

741
00:36:51,187 --> 00:36:54,475
The aneurysm
is just another symptom.

742
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:55,825
<i>It's not the cause.</i>

743
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:58,686
You add them all together,
we get...

744
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,627
We get Kaw...
Kawas...

745
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:06,647
<i>Kawas...</i>

746
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,649
It's Kawasaki's Disease.

747
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:10,689
It's autoimmune.

748
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:12,265
Yes, we knew what
"kawah" meant.

749
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,206
We just figured since it
basically presents

750
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,138
only in Asian children...

751
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:17,181
which you might have,
by the way.

752
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,855
Which is basically
why we missed it.

753
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:21,385
Rug burns...

754
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:22,836
<i>certain carpet-cleaning
chemicals</i>

755
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,052
<i>have been linked to it.</i>

756
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:25,810
Start treatment with
intravenous immunoglobulin.

757
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,336
Monitor the aneurysm.

758
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,196
If it doesn't resolve itself,
we'll have to repair it.

759
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:30,790
The rest of you...

760
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:34,125
Aren't surfing enough.

761
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:43,239
Monkey DNA...
nice touch.

762
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:44,743
Really?

763
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,048
You don't think
I should have gone with rat?

764
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:48,826
I've been second-guessing
myself all day.

765
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,971
Where are
the DNA results?

766
00:37:50,996 --> 00:37:53,504
First admit
that I was right.

767
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,304
You manipulated me
into doing it.

768
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,644
Yeah, I'll admit to that.

769
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:58,344
Now you admit
that it was incredibly easy,

770
00:37:58,346 --> 00:37:59,595
because you can't cheat
an honest man.

771
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:01,126
I love them.

772
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:03,280
I don't care if one of them
isn't biologically mine.

773
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,902
What about both?

774
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:07,211
Could be.
Haven't read these.

775
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,690
Now say I was right.

776
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:13,828
No. I'll admit
I was weak for a moment,

777
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:15,330
but I'm not doing this.

778
00:38:15,366 --> 00:38:16,613
I don't care.

779
00:38:16,648 --> 00:38:20,667
You do,
and I'll prove it.

780
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:22,193
I will shred this.

781
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:24,351
I will call off my pool,
return the money,

782
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,762
and we'll forget
all about it.

783
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,834
Or we'll go to the light box
in the lab

784
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,250
and know the truth
once and for all.

785
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:36,277
Stop.

786
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:41,437
Let me see them.

787
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:56,568
Just wanted to make sure
all three were inside.

788
00:39:24,184 --> 00:39:26,652
<i>The mayor checked.</i>

789
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:29,325
There wasn't any money missing
from the scholarship fund.

790
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:31,961
Dr. Chase told me...

791
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,446
About your disease,

792
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,816
how it made you confess
to crimes you hadn't committed.

793
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:52,714
[Sniffles]
The affair with that girl...

794
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,938
Is that real?

795
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:00,371
Honey, I...

796
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:09,933
Would never...

797
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,156
Have never cheated
on you.

798
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:18,696
[Crying]

799
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,139
I knew you could never
do that to me.

800
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:22,881
I don't know how...

801
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:24,544
But I knew.

802
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:43,541
Glad to see taking a year off
didn't dull your skill set.

803
00:40:43,555 --> 00:40:45,301
I got lucky.

804
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:48,863
About the other night...

805
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:52,132
<i>I have enough problems
with this job.</i>

806
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:54,448
Second-guessing
my best doctors

807
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:57,104
shouldn't be one of them.

808
00:40:58,954 --> 00:41:00,240
Why are you up here?

809
00:41:00,274 --> 00:41:01,878
You have your own bathroom
and office now.

810
00:41:01,912 --> 00:41:05,530
Shower. I haven't left
the hospital in four days.

811
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:07,197
Why?

812
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,776
House won't go home.

813
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:11,039
And there's no way I'm leaving
him here unsupervised.

814
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:22,277
House is screwing
with you...

815
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:25,020
By not screwing
with you.

816
00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:28,019
He's watching tv
d drinking martinis all night.

817
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:30,656
Meanwhile, he's keeping you here
searching for a plan

818
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:33,418
that doesn't even exist.

819
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:36,036
How the hell
did I not see that?

820
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:47,114
I'm glad you're back.

821
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:50,617
Me too.

822
00:42:00,913 --> 00:42:04,059
Either a hot tub
or a sauna.

823
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:07,093
(Park)
A hot tub would be cool.

824
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:09,670
New team, old team...

825
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:12,056
I present...

826
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:17,319
Phase one
of operation outer office 2.0.

827
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:28,024
Nothing's changed.

828
00:42:29,782 --> 00:42:32,313
Oh, everything has changed.

829
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,956
No.
