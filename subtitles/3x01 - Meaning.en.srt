You can take a whole
two minutes
to ease into being back.

82
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,042
I would've taken
a whole month to ease back,

the maximum rehab time

found the guy.
There's no new leads.

What? You think
he might have
shot this patient, too?

It could be MS.

It's not MS.

She had no symptoms

climbed onto her head.

Unless she's been upside-down
for the last 10 years,
MS ain't it.

91
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,690
Could be transverse myelitis,
swelling in the disks,
choking off nerve function.

92
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,775

Redo the tests.

of the problem is in the limbs
or the spine. Do an EMG.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

to cover. This guy's still got
fluid in his lungs.

103
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,522
You don't think
that's from the pool he drank?

104
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,525
Give him an O2 mask.
His leg muscles
have atrophied.

105
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,070
Tendons have shortened
from disuse,
causing intense pain.

106
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,073
Tendon surgery
will make him
more comfortable.

107
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,741
Comfortable?

I know my dad.
Mark, the doctor's
just trying to...

114
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,645
- He wouldn't kill himself.
- Fine. I'm wrong.

115
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,565
You obviously have
a better understanding of this man

118
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,030
Look, he must have been
confused, all right?
It must have been an accident.

119
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,408
I hope it was
a suicide attempt.

120
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:33,620
If he was trying to
kill himself, then he knows
how miserable his life is.

121
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,623
It means there's still
something there to kill.

122
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,626
It means your dad's
still there.

123
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,215
Sorry. Need you.

124
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,551
Thank you.

125
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,560
We were doing the EMG, but we
never got past the insertion
of the conduction pin.

126
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,520
Did she just say, "Thank you"?

127
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,814
I loaned her some money.
What went wrong?

128
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,982
Nothing went wrong.

129
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,901
If nothing went wrong,
then something went right.

130
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,444
You're not gonna tell me
why she thanked you?

131
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,654
You're not gonna tell me
what went right?

132
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:12,409
You did something
for which she is grateful,
and you're embarrassed?

133
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,829
For you. She saw you
coming up, thought you
were a 14 year-old boy.

134
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:16,997
I set her straight.

135
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,791
I am not telling you
what went wrong or right

136
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,294
until you tell me why
she said, "Thank you."

137
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:27,257
Oh, you got me.
You know I need to know.
I am so gonna fold.

138
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,844
Except you're forgetting
there's one thing
I can do now.

139
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,225
It's either that
or a reflex response.

140
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,809
What happened?

141
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:38,977

00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,439
Pleasure's all mine.
What happened?

144
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,192
When we inserted
the conduction pin,
she flinched.

145
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,194
She flinched? Did you hear?

146
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,362
Does that mean
I'm getting better?

147
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,282
How big is a flinch?
Bigger than a twitch?
Smaller than a spasm?

148
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,703
Do you smoke?
Socially, not a lot.

149
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,372
You do yoga, and you smoke?

150
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,915
I know it's hypocritical,
but...

151
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:04,545
No, the world sees your legs.
No one's checking out
your lungs.

152
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:05,838
How would smoking cause...

153
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,048
It wouldn't.
I just needed a lighter.

00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,760

Oh, my God!

156
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,265
The case was looking
so promising.
Hey, I'm not faking.

157
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,934
You moved,
therefore you can move.

158
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,939
Get this lunatic out of here
before she bores again.

159
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,482
I'm not faking!

160
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:51,175
I heard you were
watching surgery
with a patient's family,

161
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,761
talking to a patient's family.

162
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,933
It's because of your
hallucination, isn't it?
After you were shot.

163
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,269
You chose life.
You decided
you wanted meaning,

164
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:07,107
so you took a case
with no mystery,
something any doctor could do,

165
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,028
a case with no upside
except the satisfaction

166
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,238
of helping
another human being.

167
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,241

And you felt nothing.

169
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,207
I wasn't sure what
I was supposed to feel.

170
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:29,755
It's like your leg.
It's atrophied. Keep working
it. The feeling will come.

171
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,924
Sorry. Need you again.

172
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,091
I told you to get rid of her.

173
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,801
It's a good thing we didn't.
Tightness in her chest.

174
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,595
She can't breathe.
It could be pleural effusion.

175
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:40,474
Right. Either that
or she's holding her breath
like a four-year-old.

176
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,561
(GASPING)

177
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,862
Relax. I'm not gonna
burn you again.

178
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,740
I'm going to stab you!

179
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:06,625
Look, either you're faking,
or you've got
a pleural effusion.

180
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,044
That's a buildup of fluid
around the lungs,
which is very serious,

181
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,505
and I would have no choice
but to stab you in the back
with this needle

182
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:14,049
and suck all of the fluid
out of you.

183
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,845
So...
CAMERON:
We should give her a local.

184
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,764
That would defeat
the point of me being nasty.

185
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,558
Ready?

186
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,434
(GASPING)

187
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,401
Down.
She can't breathe
if she's down.

188
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,485
Down.
She can't...

189
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,445
Down, down, down! Come on!

190
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,614
(GASPING)

191
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,165
That's not a pleural effusion.

192
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,833
The problem's in her heart.

193
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,460
Can't fake that.

194
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,808
Had to relieve the pressure
three times
in the last two hours,

195
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:08,187
so either we figure out
what's causing blood to
build up around her heart,

196
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,355
or I follow her around
with a needle
for the rest of her life.

197
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,399
Echo was clean.
No structural abnormalities.

198
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,526
It could be
an infectious process, TB.

199
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,528
Or vasculitis would also
explain the effusion.

200
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:21,325
But not the paralysis.
Let's assume that
she wasn't faking it.

201
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,703
She moved,
therefore she could move.
She wasn't paralyzed.

202
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,581
Doesn't mean she was faking.
It could have been a delusion.

203
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,124
Now, either she was faking

204
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,084
and coincidentally
got a real cardiac problem

205
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,545
at the exact same time,
or it's a delusion,

206
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,632
and the fake paralysis is
a real neurological symptom.

207
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,675
Are you thinking
vascular tumor on her spine?

208
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,801
Her platelets are normal.

209
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,803
And she's been scanned up
and down. It's all clean.

210
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,889
So open her up and find it.

211
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,600
FOREMAN:
So what do you want us to do?
Just start at her neck

212
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,603
and just keep on cutting down
her spine until we stumble
on something?

213
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,230
That should work.

214
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,364
His heart rate's
a little high.
Should I be worried?

215
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,325
Probably just means
he's still in discomfort
from the surgery.

216
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,786
I'm gonna up his
morphine a little.

217
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,788
You've been so nice to us.

218
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,331
It's the job.

219
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:13,085
No, I mean, all the other
doctors, all they did was
obsess on the cancer,

220
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,089
the treatment, the damage,
just trying to fix him.

221
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,927
You're the first doctor
that's ever given a damn
about the quality of his life.

222
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:28,392
His heart rate's come down.
The morphine worked.
I was right.

223
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,608
What a touching moment.
That's why we become doctors,

224
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,194
for these rare moments
when our hearts are warmed...

225
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,405
Would you like to get a drink?

226
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,157
Are you serious,
or are you just trying to
change the subject?

227
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,951
No, I'm serious.

228
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:51,248
I drink. You drink.
We could do it at the same
time, the same table.

229
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,710
If you eat,
we could do that, too.

230
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:59,631
I mean, if the answer's no,
that's cool, but...

231
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:07,431
No, it's just you're just
coming off of surgery,
and you're not yourself yet,

232
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:11,059
and I work for you,
and even though last year's...

233
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,230
You're smiling.
I'm saying no,
and you're smiling.

234
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,901
Well, don't take it
personally. It's just
'cause you're full of crap.

235
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,946
You have no interest in
going out with me. Maybe you
did, when I couldn't walk,

236
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,325
when I was a sick puppy
that you could nurture
back to health.

237
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,203
Now that I'm healthy,
there's nothing in it for you.

238
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,456
You are not healthy.

239
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,585
Cuddy wants to see you.

240
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,261
You've been back at work
24 hours,

241
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,640
and you're already
playing hide-and-seek
in a woman's spine.

242
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,724
Who won the pool?

243
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,184
There's no tumor.

244
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,977
Her platelets are normal.
The scans didn't...

245
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:58,398
What's the worst that can
happen? Might paralyze her.
She won't even notice.

246
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,068
Her lawyers might.
You're not doing the surgery.

247
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,945
And lower the morphine
on your other patient.

248
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,948
Fine, I'll lower it
if you let me do the surgery.

249
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,575
What? You want to trade?

250
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:12,830
We're not swapping
a couple of goats for your
help putting up a barn.

251
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,915
You want something.
I want something.
We compromise.

252
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,500
It's the grownup way
to resolve our differences.

253
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,001
There already is
a mechanism for that,

254
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,003
it's called
the employer-employee
relationship,

255
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,464
I get what I want,
and you don't.

256
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,273
You tried to swap?

257
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,235
Ran a few more tests.
They came back negative.
The surgery's on.

258
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,413
You really don't give a crap,
do you?

259
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,165
Does that make me evil?

260
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,624
Yeah.

261
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,210
The girl's life is at stake.
All we're talking about
with the guy is...

262
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:04,006
All we're talking about is
the reason you took the case,
to help someone.

263
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,757
Too bad for them.
Too bad for you.

264
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:10,095
The reason we crave meaning
is because it makes us happy.

265
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,182
The first level
of happiness...

266
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,350
I'm not going away.

267
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:19,605
WILSON: The fifth level of
happiness involves creation,
changing lives.

268
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,983
HOUSE: The sixth level is
heroin. The seventh level
is you going away.

269
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,695
You're saving lives,
which is tantamount
to creating lives,

270
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,573
but all you're taking away
from this is the game.

271
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,991
You don't have to listen
to them thanking you.

272
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,785
You don't have to change
the cases you take
or even how you handle them.

273
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,080
You just have to know
that you made a difference.

274
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,091
House! You're not...
I'm not an idiot.

275
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,594
Move.
SURGEON: House,
leave her alone.

276
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,137
Close her up.
You want to know why?

277
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,514
The room's no longer sterile.

278
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,725
True, but it's not
the most interesting reason.

279
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,269
HOUSE:
That is not a sexy big toe.

280
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,646
You'd never put that
in your mouth.

281
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,772
What the hell does
that got to do...

282
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,275
I told you it was interesting,
but it gets even better.

283
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:09,988
Scurvy?

284
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,323
Yeah. Drink.

285
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,867
Like what sailors get
when they don't eat right?

286
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:17,412
Aye, aye.
Your arms and leg tissues
are choked with blood.

287
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:20,958
It makes it hard to move.
It also damages your hair
and toenails.

288
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,335
But I'm on this great diet,
lots of protein, lots of...

289
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,797
No vitamin C. Now drink.

290
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:27,881
(SLURPING)

291
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,426
Well, thank you.

292
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,847
And thank Doctor House.

293
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,598
You can send him a note.

294
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:42,396
The nurse changed his
morphine. I thought
you were worried about...

295
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:47,109
It's just post-op discomfort.
He's ready to go home.

296
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,069
So he won't have any pain?

297
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,696
Eventually.

298
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,282
Thank you.

299
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,409
Everything else
will be the same.

300
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:59,079
Well, you took away his pain,
and that changes a lot.

301
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,587
Why don't you put him
in some sort of facility,

302
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,923
some place without a pool?

303
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,304
Yeah, I could dump him there,

304
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:18,348
except he's my husband.

305
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,517
He's my son's father.

306
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,312
Right. Kids need a dad,

307
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,898
someone to play catch with,
talk about girls.

308
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,317
You know, Mark's learning
that you don't have to
abandon someone

309
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,610
just because...
Get a dog.

310
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:35,782
I'm taking care of him
for the same reason
you helped us.

311
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,785
Because some guy shot you,
and you hallucinated?

312
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,913
I have a responsibility.

313
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,832
So he's just an anchor,
weighing you
and your family down,

314
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,294
sapping your energy, wasting
your life? That's the meaning
you take from this?

315
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,921
I want to take care of him.

316
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,631
You enjoy this?

317
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,382
I can't abandon him.

318
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,221
So you don't want to
take care of him?

319
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,724
Taking care of him
doesn't fulfill you,
make you happy,

320
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,978
but not taking care of him
would make you miserable?

321
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,233
Hmm.

322
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,367
Okay, here we go.

323
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,327
(GRUNTS)

324
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,831
ARLENE: Okay, slowly.

325
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,545
I don't need your help.
I've done this
a million times.

326
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,505
Here, lie him like that.

327
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:39,054
Do that again.
Make that sound.

328
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,226
(GRUNTS)

329
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,404
What was that?

330
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,198
That was talking.

331
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,748
You guys are lousy doctors.

332
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,959
You were in such a rush
to make the patient
feel better,

333
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,878
you forgot to check
what was wrong.

334
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,213
Yoga girl walked out of here
two hours ago. You fixed her.

335
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,674
Not her. The other guy.
He had brain cancer.

336
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:19,136
They removed it eight years
ago. His condition's been
the same ever since.

337
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,305
Until last night. He spoke.

338
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,848
What'd he say?

339
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,559
(GRUNTS)

340
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:27,853
He grunted?

341
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,521
You want us to
dissect eight years

342
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,107
of medical history
with grunting
in the differential?

343
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,693
Sounds good.
Call me when you're done.

344
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,825
You're fabricating a mystery
because you're bored.

345
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,494
I am not bored.

346
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,289
Damn it!

347
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,208
You didn't tell the wife
it was only a grunt?

348
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,542
Of course not.

349
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,504
'Cause then she would
never have consented to

350
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,547
I don't remember
you being this bitchy.

351
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,467
The Vicodin dulled it.
In the sober light of day,
I'm a buzz-kill.

352
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,969
You're giving false hope
to a family
that's been wrecked.

353
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,764
Don't torture them.
Let it go. Tell the wife
it was only a grunt.

354
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:04,806
Tell her to go home.

355
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,600
I can't let her down
like that.

356
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,810
I pumped her up
with too much false hope.

357
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,524
(EXCLAIMS)

358
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:17,444
I stuck that primo!
How rad am I?

359
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,927
FOREMAN:
2002, patient had dry eyes.

360
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,762
Dry eyes plus a grunt.

361
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,140
It all makes sense.
Could be a neurological issue.

362
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,977
I get hay fever,
I put drops in my eyes.
I don't go to a neurologist.

363
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,604
Dry eyes could indicate
an autonomic dysfunction.

364
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:53,605
It goes on the board.

365
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,399
What about coughing
or boogers?

366
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,441
Should we include boogers?

367
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,026
I'm happy we're doing this.

368
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,863
I'd much rather do this
than lengthen
some guy's tendon.

369
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,366
Patient's headaches increased.
Doc scanned his head,
found a tumor.

370
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,410
You like wasting your time?
I'm learning.

371
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,413
To do what?
Reconsider solved cases

372
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,248
because you don't wanna deal
with the real world?

373
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,666
He's pushing
where there's nothing.

374
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,793
Cameron,
you are an excellent doctor.

375
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,254
You'll get lots of tearful
thank-yous
from grateful patients.

376
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,256
Yeah, aren't I
such a bitch for wanting that?

377
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,967
No, it's not a bad thing,
but it's not why I'm here.

378
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,594
I took this fellowship
to learn from House.

379
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,846
He's teaching you
to be a masochist.

380
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,098
Dry eyes goes on the board.

381
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,605
FOREMAN: In eight years,
the patient experienced
214 symptoms,

382
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,148
many of them repeated.

383
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,274
Any patterns?

384
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:41,278
Fever plus frequent urination
could mean prostatitis.

385
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,030
Or a urinary-tract infection.

386
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,199
White count was normal.
No infection.

387
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,618
FOREMAN: If you add pain
into the mix, fever,

388
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,829
frequent urination
could indicate
a kidney problem.

389
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,122
I like it.

390
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:55,000
No, creatinine and BUN
were both normal.

391
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,127
Not the kidney part.
The pain part.

392
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,255
HOUSE: Abdominal pain
plus all that stuff could
equal a pancreatic cyst.

393
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,425
Perfect. You managed to pick
the one symptom he never had,

394
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,551
abdominal pain.

395
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,386
It's the first symptom
on the board, "grunt."

396
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,639
Grunting isn't pathognomonic
for abdominal pain.

397
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:12,726
No, the traditional diagnostic
marker is compression
of the diaphragm,

398
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,521
vibration of the larynx,
leading to the audible sound,

399
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,897
"I have a pain in my abdomen."

400
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,900
Richard's symptoms are culled
from eight years
of medical history.

401
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:23,403
They're not patterned.
These are random,
individual events over time.

402
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:27,282
Illnesses have incubation
periods. Do an upper
endoscopic ultrasound.

403
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,659
His throat will collapse.

404
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,119
Muscle degeneration
in his neck won't
tolerate the scope.

405
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,871
It's an automatic trach.
You're talking about him

406
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:33,914
like he's an invalid.

407
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:34,998
We were insensitive.

408
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:38,961
Does he drool? Can he
hold his neck straight?
Does he choke on his food?

409
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,799
His neck's fine.
His throat's
not gonna collapse.

410
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,884
Cameron,
get consent from the wife.

411
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,180
Open.

412
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,022
I need you to swallow.

413
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,450
Sorry about that.

414
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,500
Here we go.

415
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,678
We're passing through
the lower esophageal sphincter

416
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,430
into the antrum
of the stomach.

417
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,059
There's the tail
of the pancreas.

418
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,269
Looks clean.

419
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:40,606
Moving medially. The body
and the head of the pancreas
look clean.

420
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,649
Get it out. Get it out.

421
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,277
It's stuck.
I can't move it.
His throat's collapsed.

422
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,486
(CHOKES)

423
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:49,239
His vitals are all over
the place. We're losing him.

424
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,659
Cutting.

425
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,915
We trached him, endoscopically
removed the probe,
and he's breathing again,

426
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,417
so, all in all, great idea.

427
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,419
Get a look at the pancreas
before the world ended?

428
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:03,545
It was clean.

429
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,047
Which means,
barring anything else,

430
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,132
meaning you,
he can go home tomorrow.

431
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:09,218
This man nearly died.
How can you discharge him?

432
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:11,386
His throat collapsed
because of what we predicted.

433
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,180
You stick something
down someone's throat,

434
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:17,684
they gag, spasm, which he did.
It took us a half an hour
to get the thing out.

435
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,853
Except our patient's throat
was sedated,

436
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,440
which means the brain
should have sent a signal
not to do anything.

437
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:28,612
This could be cancer
or some bizarre
neuro-degeneration,

438
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:32,950
even a new type of vascular...
Stop it. You're enjoying this.

439
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:34,952
I find it interesting.

440
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,370
It's interesting
only if you're right.

441
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,039
If you're wrong,
we're torturing this guy
to amuse you.

442
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,043
Half hour to remove the probe?

443
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:45,587
House.

444
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,214
It's not a spasm.

445
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,717
His throat didn't collapse.
It locked down.

446
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,595
The brain is supposed to tell
every muscle in the body
to relax and contract

447
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,806
at the same time.
This muscle was
only contracting,

448
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,891
which means the signal
from the brain
was not getting through.

449
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,727
There are no lesions
on his brain, nothing
to interrupt any orders.

450
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,104
All it takes is one wire down.

451
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:03,605
You have no evidence
of any wires down.

452
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:07,109
A few microtumors on
the meninges, and suddenly
you're choking to death.

453
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,404
You want to look at
the lining of his brain?

454
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:13,448
The amount of contrast
material you need to
pump up there just to see...

455
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,993
He'll bleed into his brain!
No, he won't.

456
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:20,706
Because that wouldn't be
interesting. You can get
permission this time.

457
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,670
HOUSE: The brain is enclosed
in a sack called the meninges.

458
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,630
Does this mean
the cancer's back?

459
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,716
No. No, no, no.
House.

460
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:40,684
If we found cancer, it
wouldn't be the original
cancer. It'd be new.

461
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,271
So, what, more surgery,
more radiation.

462
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,564
Might not be the worst thing.

463
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:51,195
If this isn't just ancient
history, then maybe it's
something we can correct.

464
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,947
Might even get some
brain function back.

465
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:56,158
He could get better?

466
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,284
No.

467
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:07,211
But understanding
what you're saying
will be nice.

468
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,671
Maybe you could figure out
ways to communicate.

469
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,800
Thank God he spoke to you.

470
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:18,972
Mrs. McNeil, the test to do
this is very risky.
He could die.

471
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,479
He's already dead.

472
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,536
<i>FOREMAN.: Chase, go slow.</i>

473
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,788
I've already injected it
into his spinal canal.

474
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,916
Next stop, his brain.

475
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:54,550
FOREMAN:
Contrast material entering
into the fourth ventricle.

476
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,051
No parenchymal bleeds.

477
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,762
CHASE: Blood pressure's high,
but it's holding.

478
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:02,057
Meninges are intact.
No bleeding.

479
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,814
Oh, God. Foreman, get in here.

480
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,290
Surgeon repaired the CSF leak.

481
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,749
You're lucky he didn't die.

482
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,918
I'm lucky?
He's the one who didn't die.

483
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:31,295
We told you he'd hemorrhage.

484
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:34,131
You told me he'd bleed
into his brain,
not out of his ear.

485
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,507
You've got to drop this.

486
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:37,217
We're missing something.

487
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:41,555
We did a dangerous test,
and something bad happened.
That's all this is.

488
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:46,852
Give me a tour of the brain,
Foreman.
Walk me through the scans.

489
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,897
1998, what happened?

490
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:53,400
Five-centimeter,
grade-four astrocytoma
between the parietal...

491
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:57,571
Nothing. Next?
The speck on the superior
temporal region.

492
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,281
It's a re-growth, benign.

493
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,241
The star thingy
next to the Rathke cleft?

494
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:02,784
Scar tissue from a biopsy.

495
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,661
House, every speck
is not a suspect.

496
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:08,332
It's years of surgeons
digging around in his head.
Let him go.

497
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,753

those words.

there since the surgery.

He had a hypothalamic
