1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,478
It's almost 11:00.

2
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:11,689
She needs a lot of sleepthese days.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,096
Please, Mrs. Bardach.

4
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:16,768
I haven't seen her for a week.

5
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:19,372
I'll see how she's feeling.

6
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:21,812
- Thank you.
- You know what to do.

7
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:37,471
Bardach: All done?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,618
I, uh, scrubbed
for 45 seconds,

9
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:43,136
did the nails,
all the way downthe elbows,

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,159
the whole deal.

11
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:46,675
[Sneezes]

12
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:48,203
- Are you sick?
- No, no, no.

13
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:50,431
- Cough, sore throat?
- No, no.

14
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:53,250
I just--Sometimes I sneeze
when I look at lights.

15
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,462
I always have.

16
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:55,298
I'm sorry. You better--

17
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:57,739
I would never get her sick.

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,492
Please.

19
00:01:05,835 --> 00:01:07,238
A mask.

20
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:08,879
Got me by the bouncer.

21
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,488
She's crazy.
She's let me out like six times
in the last two months.

22
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,087
Every time it's just
to go to the hospital.
I'm a prisoner.

23
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:16,695
Aw, it's okay.

24
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:25,492
- It's ugly.
- No.

25
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:31,857
I wasn't looking
at the scar anyways.

26
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:38,655
Take off your mask.

27
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:43,684
Uh...If your mom
comes in here, she--

28
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:47,188
Hey, give me a kiss
or I'll kill you.

29
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,061
Your skin.

30
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:58,915
Are you okay?

31
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:01,449
[Wheezes]

32
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:03,545
Augh.

33
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:09,610
Melinda, can you--

34
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:12,730
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Can you breathe?

35
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,092
What's wrong?
Is it your heart?

36
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,577
What's wrong?

37
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,821
Mrs. Bardach!

38
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:28,828
Melinda, I don't know how to use this.
I've never used one of these before.

39
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,508
[Choking]

40
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:43,041
[Catches her wind]

41
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,545
What did you do to her?

42
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:53,073
2X16 - Safe

43
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:18,570
Original Airdate (FOX): 4 APR-2006

44
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:50,949
Cuddy called.

45
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,719
I know.
Saw the caller ID.

46
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:56,257
Young girl,
anaphylactic shock.

47
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:57,907
You answered?

48
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,855
Turns out that's
what stops the ringing.

49
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:03,184
It's a weird case.

50
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:07,865
I thought you did
the dishes last night.

51
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,076
It was your day.

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,070
I did. Those are new.

53
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:12,669
Midnight snack.

54
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,904
For a midnight snack,
you made a pot roast.

55
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:18,304
The same pot roast
I made last night.

56
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:21,736
Yeah. Actually,
it was after midnight.

57
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:24,163
Today is your day, right?

58
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,638
You want me out of here.
I get it.

59
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:28,274
No, it's fine if you stay.

60
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:30,859
The place I was gonna move,
the guy never called.

61
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:33,628
- Otherwise, I'll already be there.
- I said it's fine if you stay.

62
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:35,765
Yeah. That's why you're
making me miserable.

63
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:38,880
Maybe I just want to make sure
you do your fair share around here.

64
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:39,860
Tha--

65
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:41,351
What's weird about it?

66
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:46,083
The girl with the allergies.

67
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,251
Yeah.

68
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:50,298
- She's immunocompromised.
- What are you doing?

69
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:51,520
What? You asked me--

70
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:53,133
You knew that I was interested.

71
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,835
That gives you
a valuable bargaining chip.

72
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:58,566
You could've had me
doing dishes for a week.

73
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:02,758
Okay.

74
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:10,393
The allergic reaction happened
while she was in a clean room.

75
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,032
Why does she have
a clean room in her home?

76
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:23,514
Heart transplant.
Immune system's in the toilet.

77
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:27,414
Mommy builds her little angel
a John Travolta-quality bubble.

78
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:30,904
Six months after the transplant,
she doesn't need to be
confined to a clean room.

79
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:34,876
Six months without putting out,
Dr. Cuddy doesn't need
to wear thong panties, but

80
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:36,103
it's not our call.

81
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:38,360
I was wondering when
you'd get around to my panties.

82
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,416
She's had four days of workups.

83
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:43,799
They've tested everyone who
came anywhere near that room,
everything in the room.

84
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,830
It's like an Agatha Christie mystery.

85
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:48,342
Maybe it's not what was there.
It's what she was doing.

86
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:51,010
Exercise allergy.
Love it.

87
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:57,197
What sort of exercise could
a strapping young man and
a nubile teenage nymphet possibly--

88
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:59,452
Mom was in the room
within seconds.

89
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:02,641
So the boyfriend brought in
an allergen and is lying about it.

90
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:04,358
Or the girl snuck out and
she's lying about that.

91
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:07,120
Or the parents are lying
about the room being clean.

92
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:09,054
These are your big ideas?

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,388
Somebody's lying?

94
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,064
Hasn't let me down yet.

95
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:16,083
Recheck  Mom, Dad, the girl,
the boy, the room, and the home.

96
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,136
Any of you have a new soap,
detergent, perfume?

97
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,731
No. Barbara's really
careful about that stuff.

98
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,666
And you haven't been
outside recently?

99
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,776
How could I?
I'm trapped up there.

100
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,072
You're not trapped.
It's just safe--

101
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,905
They won't even
tell me the alarm code.

102
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:36,029
Just tell her I can
go back to school.

103
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:37,401
Till we clear this up.

104
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:38,295
Fine.

105
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,110
Find out what I'm allergic to,
and I'll stay away from it.

106
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:45,251
Then I can go back to school, right?

107
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,952
It's up to your parents.

108
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:50,038
But medically,
there's no reason--

109
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,418
Told you.

110
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,144
Could I speak to you outside
for a second, please?

111
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:02,023
You know, this is hard enough
without you in there giving--

112
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:02,740
She asked my opinion.

113
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:05,071
She is 16 years old.
Lie to her.

114
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:07,482
When I was eight,
my mom, she hated--

115
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,475
I  know.
I-I need to loosen up.

116
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:12,172
I'm overprotective.
I saw Finding Nemo. I get it.

117
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,447
I  don't need another story.

118
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,078
But you're not just
being overprotective.

119
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:17,084
You're one of the most
overprotective parents
I've ever seen.

120
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,200
She has the best private tutors.

121
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:22,129
I let her friends visit.
I'm not going to apologize.

122
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,944
Just giving you my thoughts.

123
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,932
She almost died three times
during her childhood.

124
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:29,247
Penicillin,
bee stings, peanuts.

125
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:30,003
I've seen her file.

126
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:33,560
Six month ago,
we leave her home alone
for the first time on a weekend.

127
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:36,124
She goes out,
buys one chocolate chip cookie.

128
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:37,617
Peanut butter in the dough.

129
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:42,277
She's forgotten her epi pen,
she drives to the hospital,
passes out, has an accident.

130
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,534
Steering wheel
crushed her chest.

131
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:46,410
She ended up losing her heart.

132
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:49,506
So when you say to me

133
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:53,741
that I'm one of the most
overprotective parents
you've seen, please...

134
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:58,910
please introduce me to the ones
who were more protective

135
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:01,634
so that I can find out
what they're doing right.

136
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:11,829
She's allergic to having
a sucky social life.

137
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:14,913
Give the parents a break.
They're just trying
to keep her healthy.

138
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:16,929
Everything in here's
labeled "hypoallergenic."

139
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,232
Check it anyway.

140
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,114
Cameron.

141
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:28,130
This place is cleaner
than her hospital room.

142
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,520
No alarm on this window.

143
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,020
It's 20-foot drop.

144
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:35,625
You can get to the tree from here.
There's some bark scraped off.

145
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,783
Sure. Heart-transplant girl
swung down there on a vine.

146
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:41,891
Maybe she was hooking up
with Tarzan and Cheetah
down by the elephant graveyard.

147
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,935
Or...Jane stayed in the tree house
and Tarzan came up.

148
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:54,124
Okay. Um, I spent
most of the night Friday.

149
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,716
But if her mom finds out
about that, she will totally freak.

150
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,018
You guys had sex?

151
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,721
Yeah, but, you know,
I did everything I could
to make sure she wouldn't get sick.

152
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,060
A latex allergy?

153
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,390
What do you mean,
like a condom? We didn't--

154
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:08,589
You had unsafe sex?

155
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,465
The whole unsafe thing
didn't tell you something?

156
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:14,244
Yeah, but we didn't like
plan on it, you know? It just--

157
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,878
I don't know. We're in love.
We've been dating for two years.

158
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:18,134
Practically a lifetime.

159
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,006
How about a semen allergy?

160
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:22,683
We're gonna need
a semen sample.

161
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:26,212
You can use
the bathroom over there.

162
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:28,617
Right. Uh, how do I...

163
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,185
Aim and shoot.

164
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:34,959
No thinking about Dr. Cameron.
We'll know.

165
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:37,724
We should tell her parents.

166
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:39,322
Why stop there?
Call the cops.

167
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,313
Melinda's a minor.

168
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,268
And if we nip it in the bud here,
teenagers will never again have sex.

169
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:46,195
The parents will find out
when they get the bill anyway.

170
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,812
Oh, so you're fine with them
finding out as long as you don't
have to tell them personally?

171
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:49,763
Pretty much.

172
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,230
Too bad it's not you
giving the sample.

173
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,801
We'd be done by now.

174
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:02,786
Test was negative.
No semen allergy.

175
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:07,153
Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak
on the night before the anaphylaxis.

176
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:08,560
I don't buy that it's unrelated.

177
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:11,581
He loves her.
Did everything he could
to make sure she wouldn't get sick.

178
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:13,427
What does that mean?

179
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:16,935
Love is an emotion
certain people experience,
similar to happiness.

180
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,755
No. Maybe I should give
a more relatable example.

181
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,551
Oh, snap!

182
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:24,093
What did he do to protect her?

183
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,794
Brillo-pad his privates?

184
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,104
- I assumed he washed and he--
- Oh, good work.

185
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,143
Assumptions are so much
faster than actual questions.

186
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:42,160
House:
You the boyfriend?

187
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,431
Need to borrow you.

188
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:46,094
What is going on?

189
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:49,604
Don't worry. I'll return him
in roughly the same condition.

190
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,869
Do you take anything
to stay healthy?

191
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,099
Something stronger
than an apple a day?

192
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:01,049
Is he okay?

193
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:04,417
He's just tired...
from being in a coma so long.

194
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:05,527
What'd you take?

195
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:08,081
Don't worry.
He can keep a secret.

196
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:12,911
Antibiotics?

197
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,773
Penicillin?

198
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,608
Any of those names ring a bell?

199
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:23,658
Yeah, uh...my friend Elliot,
his dad had, like, a whole bottle
that he hadn't finished, so...

200
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:27,301
I swiped it and took a bunch
for, like, a week.

201
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:30,261
There's no way I was gonna risk
breathing germs on Melinda.

202
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:33,797
This is the one downside
of teenage sex:

203
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:35,287
You're idiots.

204
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,645
You almost killed
your girlfriend.

205
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:40,659
She's allergic to penicillin.

206
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:43,170
What, do you think there was
still some on my lips?

207
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:44,775
I brushed my teeth.

208
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:47,755
Think lower and more fun.

209
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,829
I mean, it can--

210
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,769
It can go through your stuff?

211
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:55,813
Totally, dude.

212
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,547
There's this administrator here,
whenever she gets sick,
she just gives me the prescription.

213
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:07,422
But you know, they tested Melinda,
they said...she wasn't allergic to my stuff.

214
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:09,068
Yeah, four days later.

215
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:13,184
By that time, the penicillin
was crusting up a sock
at the bottom of your hamper.

216
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:15,721
Do you have to tell her
it was my fault?

217
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,739
No.

218
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:23,373
Great part of being a grownup,
you never have to do anything.

219
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:32,115
You're releasing her?

220
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,605
What happened?
What did you find out?

221
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:36,305
Tests on your house ruled out
any environmental allergens.

222
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,595
Yeah, but what caused this?

223
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,942
We believe it's highly unlikely that
this set of circumstances will repeat itself.

224
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,122
What set of circumstances?

225
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:45,806
It's good news.
She's healthy.

226
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,824
- But you might want to talk--
- Cameron!

227
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:53,087
- I can't breathe.
- Getting the epi.

228
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,718
Lewis: Give her the shot!
- No murmurs, no friction rubs.

229
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:01,567
- What are you waiting for?
- Quiet.

230
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,684
She's coughing up white sputum.

231
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,114
Crackling two-thirds
of the way up.

232
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:09,760
Look at her neck.

233
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:11,839
Please. She is vomiting.
Would you give her the shot?

234
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:14,110
It's not an allergy.
It's her heart.

235
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:21,895
What's the good news?
What's the bad news?

236
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:23,820
Congestive heart failure.

237
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:25,187
Is which?

238
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:27,225
- Good news.
- Why?

239
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:30,520
I don't know.
It just sounded like you.

240
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:34,311
New puzzle piece.
Always good news.
What's the bad news?

241
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:37,384
We've got two puzzle pieces
from two different puzzles.

242
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:39,126
Seems that way.

243
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,863
What if her anaphylaxis
wasn't anaphylaxis?

244
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:45,995
Toxicity from the anti-rejection meds could
cause a seizure and then heart failure.

245
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:50,286
And get cured by
a mommy-wielded epi pen?
It's anaphylaxis. What else?

246
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,194
What if they really are two puzzles?

247
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:55,242
You think she had two unrelated
rare conditions in one week?

248
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:58,951
- We explained the anaphylaxis.
- What do you mean, we? I did!

249
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,283
At least I thought I did.
Maybe I didn't.

250
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:03,107
Still, it was all me.

251
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:07,050
Heart problems aren't so rare for
someone who's had a heart transplant.

252
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:09,989
I say we assume House was
right about the anaphylaxis.

253
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:11,522
It is tempting.

254
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:16,924
Heart failure could be either infection,
coronary disease, or rejection.

255
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:19,914
Sorry. There's a reason
they call it the white board.

256
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:21,457
It's not my rule.

257
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:25,498
What ties both
these conditions together?

258
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:39,238
Okay, we can all stare at each other,
or we can investigate
what caused the heart failure.

259
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:41,372
Just the heart failure.

260
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,171
You wanna give me
that black marker?

261
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,211
There's no fever,
so it's probably not infection.

262
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:56,612
Or no fever because she's been
on immunosuppressants
for the last six months.

263
00:14:56,696 --> 00:15:00,763
Let's do a C.T.,
get a heart biopsy
and redo the blood work.

264
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:04,548
- Anything?
- Not yet.

265
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:07,747
So I hear you don't want
teenagers having sex.

266
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:09,841
Teen suicide rate isn't
high enough for you already?

267
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,298
I just think
those two are brats.

268
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:13,381
The girl undercuts her mother
any chance she gets.

269
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,522
Yeah, it's the daughter's fault.
Has nothing to do with
mom infantilizing her.

270
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:17,395
Good point.

271
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:21,221
Explains why parents
who don't pay attention get
such nice, well-adjusted children.

272
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,976
What's this?

273
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:24,687
Think it's vegetation?

274
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:25,837
Yeah.

275
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:28,865
The kind made of muscle
that opens your heart valves.

276
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:30,447
It's nothing.

277
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:32,188
She's clean.

278
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:37,471
It's good news.
You don't show any signs
of coronary artery disease.

279
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,795
So  what's next?

280
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,495
Well, blood work
to rule out infection,

281
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,649
and then a heart surgical biopsy
to rule out rejection.

282
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:48,013
But you don't think you're gonna
rule out both things, do you?

283
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:49,348
N o.

284
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,386
I'm gonna lose this heart, right?

285
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,592
Hopefully we'll find
the problem and fix it.

286
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:58,507
You'll keep
your heart a long time.

287
00:15:58,633 --> 00:15:59,576
How long?

288
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:03,253
Well, there could be
drug breakthroughs that allow you
to keep it for decades more.

289
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,019
[Chuckles] Yeah.

290
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:08,172
That's the answer
my cardiologist always gives me.

291
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:09,975
I looked it up on the web.

292
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,902
It's like five or ten years, right?

293
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:16,815
That's about the average.

294
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,845
That's why I need to have a life.

295
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:23,455
Why can't you convince my mom
to let me go back to school?

296
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:28,157
Melinda,
you've got bigger worries
right now than missing school.

297
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:33,620
Until we figure out
what's wrong with your heart,
the safest place for you to be is right here.

298
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:04,868
"Pain in My Heart"
by Otis's Reddings

299
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:10,514
# Pain in my heart #

300
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:14,821
# Is treating me poor #

301
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:18,505
# Where can my baby be #

302
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:22,889
# Lord, no one knows #

303
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:27,811
# Pain in my heart #

304
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:32,475
# Just won't let me sleep #

305
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:36,443
# Where can my baby be? #

306
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:40,262
# Lord, where can she be? #

307
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:44,442
# And now the days #

308
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:47,401
# Has begin to get tough #

309
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:49,833
# Said I want you to come back #

310
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:54,451
# Come back, come back, baby #

311
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:58,282
# I've had enough, oh-oh...#

312
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:08,120
Where's...
the hooker, I assume?

313
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:10,473
Right up here, buddy.

314
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:17,276
You said
you'd hang the stethoscope
if you were having sex.

315
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,035
I didn't say it had to be
with another person.

316
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,037
Can you think of anything
that would tie together
anaphylaxis and heart failure?

317
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:24,919
No.

318
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,953
I was waiting
out there for hours!

319
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:30,034
I need a lot of foreplay.

320
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:32,601
And then there's
the cuddling afterwards.

321
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,925
Any  way that
anaphylaxis isn't anaphylaxis
even it responds to epi?

322
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:39,180
No. Oh, no wonder
you were in the mood.

323
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,762
This month's
New Jersey Journal of Cardiology.

324
00:18:41,846 --> 00:18:42,989
Have you seen the centerfold?

325
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,354
There's no way
those valves are real.

326
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:48,544
Any chance that the heart failure
could be unrelated to--

327
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,167
No. If you need
time alone to work,

328
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:54,289
you just have to say so.
You don't have to lie about it.

329
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:57,773
- Lying's more fun.
- Being lied to, not as much fun.

330
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,483
Please have an answer
to this question:

331
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:01,125
What's for dinner?

332
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:03,990
Wilson:
You still haven't done the dishes?

333
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:06,970
You want one of these?
I think I got a couple of blueberries.

334
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:10,564
Nope. Sorry. Just one.

335
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:14,697
Oh, don't look all weepy.

336
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,358
You got a problem with me,
deal with it.

337
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:19,233
Short my sheets or something.

338
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,214
[Sighs]

339
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,968
[Wilson does the dishes]

340
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,200
Biopsy was negative for rejection.

341
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:29,218
Thank God.

342
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,567
And what about the blood tests?

343
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:31,827
Showed no infection.

344
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:34,602
So we still don't know
what caused her heart failure.

345
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,022
Let's just be happy
she doesn't need a new heart.

346
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,801
Mrs. Bardach, it could have
just been a one-time thing.

347
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:42,013
So she has
an allergic reaction
and heart failure,

348
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,944
and neither of them
can be explained.

349
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:46,320
Are they doing
any more tests on her?

350
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:48,134
- No.
- She's not here.

351
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:54,693
Notify local hospitals, cab companies,
the state troopers, and local cops.

352
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,197
Any security officers off duty
are back on duty.

353
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,204
Woman:
<i>We're on it.</i>

354
00:19:58,288 --> 00:20:01,295
And I'm going to need some pictures.
And go through those drawers.

355
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:04,746
And I want at least two people
going over the surveillance tapes.

356
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,136
That work?

357
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:07,932
Are those all her clothes?

358
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:09,411
Uh, yeah.

359
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,362
She's obviously
still in the building.

360
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,247
So where did she go?
What does she want?

361
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,903
See her boyfriend?

362
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:17,199
She didn't take her phone.

363
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,926
She wants to be outside.

364
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:36,506
If you're trying to
scare your parents, great job.

365
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,737
Can we go back now?

366
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,586
I hate her.

367
00:20:44,481 --> 00:20:48,401
When I was eight years old,
I was sick.

368
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:52,983
- Not really sick,
but the point is, my mom, she--
- She was like this before.

369
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:56,914
Home by 9:00 every night.
Can't go out on the weekends.
Can't do sports.

370
00:20:57,281 --> 00:21:00,450
- Transplant just gave her
what she always wanted.
- Melinda...

371
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:03,028
You had heart failure.

372
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:08,045
This is kind of an insane time
to be criticizing your mom
about being overprotective.

373
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:15,499
I know. I mean, this is
what makes it even worse.
All of her craziness, it just...

374
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:19,072
It makes sense now.

375
00:21:19,198 --> 00:21:21,519
Everything's gonna be all right.

376
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:24,906
I didn't even try to get outside.

377
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:27,678
I was too scared.

378
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:28,853
Come on.

379
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:44,024
Whoa, whoa. Melinda,
please walk back towards me.

380
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:45,245
Why?

381
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:47,184
Please?

382
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:54,525
It feels kind of weird.

383
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:58,510
It's called steppage gait.

384
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:00,027
Lewis:
Is it serious?

385
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:01,637
No, not necessarily.

386
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:04,223
All right,
stick your leg out, hold it up.

387
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:09,835
She was under anesthesia
for the biopsy. If she lost oxygen--

388
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,066
C.T. ruled out brain damage.

389
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:15,634
Put your leg down.
Relax.

390
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:20,183
Why is her leg
twitching like that?

391
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:22,803
Fasciculation.

392
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,257
Is that serious?

393
00:22:24,632 --> 00:22:27,612
It's paralysis,
and it's ascending.

394
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:30,536
She's going to
lose the use of her legs?

395
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:37,197
To start with.

396
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:42,375
It's ascending fast.
She can hardly extend her leg now.

397
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,856
At this rate, it'll be up to
her lungs in a matter of days.

398
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:50,877
So, anaphylaxis,
heart failure, paralysis.

399
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:54,247
Couldn't put the first two together.
I'm guessing we can't put all three together.

400
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:55,579
Tick paralysis?

401
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,737
Could also explain the anaphylaxis,
maybe even the--

402
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:00,580
Penicillin allergy explains
the allergic reaction much better.

403
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:04,419
Particularly
because tick paralysis is
usually accompanied by a tick.

404
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:07,309
We did
two comprehensive physicals
looking for insect bites.

405
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:09,891
Can we put any two
of those together?

406
00:23:09,975 --> 00:23:11,682
How about we stipulate?

407
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,476
You argued that there must be
something to connect all three symptoms,

408
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,154
you mocked us for not figuring it out,
and finally you let us discuss the paralysis

409
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:20,608
on its own because
it's what's gonna kill her.

410
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:21,770
Now, it's ascending.

411
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:24,347
Her MRIs are clean,
so rule out stroke or aneurysm.

412
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:26,338
- ALS? MS?
- Progression's too quick.

413
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:28,554
- Spinal lesion from leukemia?
- Too slow.

414
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:30,083
It's most likely
Guillain-Barre.

415
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,534
She's immunosuppressed.
What about botulism?

416
00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:34,723
Not unless she's been
walking around on her hands
the last couple of days.

417
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:36,919
Botulism paralysis is
descending, not ascending.

418
00:23:37,003 --> 00:23:37,871
Could be a virus.

419
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:40,278
West Nile, even polio
with her immune system shot.

420
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:43,645
Get an LP and
do PCRs for the viruses.

421
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:46,043
And get an EMG
to check for Guillain-Barre.

422
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:48,852
Foreman's right. We gotta
find out why she's paralyzed.

423
00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:54,351
But not before staring at me
dumbly for a few seconds.

424
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,730
Foreman:
We ran more tests
on your daughter.

425
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,891
We took a lumbar puncture,
got some spinal fluid.

426
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:14,978
Then we brought her to the lab
to look for infections that
could be affecting her brain.

427
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:22,672
We also did an EMG to check
how her muscles and nerves are
responding to electrical impulses.

428
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:26,709
Unfortunately, her muscles are showing
increased weakness above the knee.

429
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:28,492
You mean she's getting worse?

430
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:31,804
The LP and PCRs ruled out
polio and West Nile.

431
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:33,892
We think it's Guillain-Barre.

432
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:37,779
The body's immune response
goes haywire and starts
attacking the peripheral nerves.

433
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:40,640
It causes
muscle weakness and paralysis.

434
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:42,320
How bad is it?

435
00:24:42,404 --> 00:24:46,881
It's serious, but
Guillain-Barre usually responds
very well to plasmapheresis.

436
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,984
Foreman:
You see, the plasma,
the clear liquid part of her blood,

437
00:24:57,068 --> 00:25:01,437
contains most of the antibodies,
which are overreacting and
attacking her nervous system.

438
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:06,390
The machine spins her blood
in a centrifuge and separates parts
of the blood based on weight.

439
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:10,835
White blood cells are the heaviest,
then the red cells, then platelets and plasma.

440
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,797
We discard the stuff that's causing
all the trouble and return the good blood cells
back to her body in a replacement fluid.

441
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:21,217
If it works, we'll see results
in a couple of days.

442
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:30,725
You didn't get any messages
for me last week, did you?

443
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:31,745
Nope.

444
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:33,120
That's funny.

445
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,878
The guy finally called back.
The place I lost?

446
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,957
He said he left
three voice mails.

447
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:38,612
Gotta pee.

448
00:25:38,696 --> 00:25:42,762
Which I never got,
if that wasn't clear.

449
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:44,481
He must be lying.

450
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:46,447
You wouldn't want
to live with a liar.

451
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:48,818
- You erased my messages?
- Yup.

452
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:50,871
Decided I wanted you to stay.

453
00:25:50,955 --> 00:25:52,165
Told you that, didn't I?

454
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:58,806
You're...miserable, and you're lonely, and
you're gonna trap me here to keep me
every bit as miserable and lonely, too.

455
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,934
- Yeah, and you're
happy, happy, happy.
- Okay.

456
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,951
Hey, I'm obviously going
through a rough patch here.

457
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:07,784
Wife leaves, tends
to bum somebody out.

458
00:26:08,982 --> 00:26:10,933
Do you know
where my pee went?

459
00:26:13,784 --> 00:26:15,151
You're missing some?

460
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:18,285
No. Came out of me and
went right into the toilet.

461
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,028
Now, why would that be?

462
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:22,042
You're William Tell.

463
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:23,834
You could pick an apple
off someone's head?

464
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:26,862
No, it's because there was
no clear plastic wrap over the toilet.

465
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:29,946
Stuff's in the kitchen.
You have plenty of time.
All that was missing was the will.

466
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,868
This isn't a college dorm.

467
00:26:31,978 --> 00:26:33,184
It could be.

468
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:35,079
We're not 18!

469
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,295
So what?

470
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:37,444
What did I do to you?

471
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:40,879
I scammed you into doing the dishes,
I made you sit on the steps.

472
00:26:40,963 --> 00:26:42,960
I didn't kill your puppy.

473
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:45,029
I did not make you miserable.

474
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:47,041
Oh, so this is therapy?

475
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:51,289
No. It's just...
makes me smile.

476
00:26:51,828 --> 00:26:53,842
All right, I'm finding
a new place tomorrow.

477
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:56,327
Right, but not tonight.
[Pops cork]

478
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:59,335
Well, I figure you wanna shave
my eyebrows while I'm asleep.

479
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:01,570
I wouldn't wanna
deprive you of that last smile.

480
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:03,160
You're not going anywhere.

481
00:27:03,244 --> 00:27:04,816
You're gonna sit on my couch,

482
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:08,430
and depress us both,
because you just can't admit
that it's over with your wife.

483
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:10,125
That's right.
I'm here on vacation.

484
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:11,712
Have you gotten a lawyer yet?

485
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:17,650
- That's--That's not...
- You even called one?

486
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,153
As long as you're here,
it's just a fight.

487
00:27:22,215 --> 00:27:26,742
As soon as you get a place,
then it's a divorce.

488
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,329
Everything sucks.

489
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:37,102
Might as well find
something to smile about.

490
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:50,051
Reflexes are
marginally weaker.

491
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:51,623
The paralysis is getting worse?

492
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:54,820
Sometimes it takes a few treatments
for the plasmapheresis to work.

493
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,189
Why do these things
keep happening to me?

494
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:01,727
Dan's back.

495
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:04,758
Hey, baby, did you hear that?
Dan's here.

496
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,952
I don't want to see him.

497
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:13,349
I'll tell him
to come back later.

498
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,249
No.

499
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:18,132
Mommy, stay here, please.

500
00:28:19,527 --> 00:28:21,125
Of course.

501
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,563
...

502
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,235
Is she okay?

503
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:57,404
She's sleeping.

504
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:59,252
I'm sure she's exhausted.

505
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:02,055
Mood swings are common
with the anti-rejection meds.

506
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,014
No. She's had mood swings.
This isn't it. This is--

507
00:29:07,337 --> 00:29:09,438
She's given up.

508
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,647
I know you think I'm--

509
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:17,341
This isn't what I wanted.

510
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:21,550
She's always fought with me.

511
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:26,429
Ever since she was a baby,
she was so damn stubborn.

512
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:29,460
But I never
wanted her like this.

513
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,857
I just wanted her safe.

514
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:37,367
Doctor! Doctor!
[Beeping]

515
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:40,473
She can't breathe!

516
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:42,298
She couldn't get
a whole sentence out.

517
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,821
She's using accessory muscles.

518
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:48,804
- 02 sat's down to 90. Lungs clear?
- Yeah.

519
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,470
Does your tongue feel
swollen? Is it itchy?

520
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:51,622
No hives.

521
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:53,250
It's not an allergy.

522
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,455
Lips are cyanotic.
We got to intubate.

523
00:29:55,717 --> 00:29:57,165
What are you doing?

524
00:29:57,249 --> 00:29:58,807
Pushing lorazepam.

525
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:02,064
She's not getting enough oxygen.
We've got to assist her breathing.

526
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:15,088
What was that?
Was that a reaction
to the treatment?

527
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,724
It's the paralysis.

528
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:18,159
It's reaching her lungs.

529
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,023
Chase:
Melinda's dying.

530
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,274
We're all dying.

531
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:30,609
How fast?

532
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,495
Too fast for Guillain-Barre.

533
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:35,468
Cuddy wants to get her an MRI
to rule out a spinal lesion.

534
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,934
Cuddy?
What's shedoing on this?

535
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,198
The family lost confidence in us.

536
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:42,869
I don't blame them.

537
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,816
I'll be right in.

538
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:01,249
It's like she got poisoned
with a nerve agent.

539
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:03,523
Glue inhalation. Would explain
why she hasn't admitted it.

540
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:05,013
Tox screen was clear for pot.

541
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,145
Middle-class heart transplant
patient's gonna huff glue?

542
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,414
Pesticides?

543
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:11,017
Cameron:
This time of year,
they're not spraying.

544
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:12,571
This girl's tough.

545
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:14,870
She gets what she wants.

546
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:18,902
She's deprived of human contact,
she gets herself a backdoor man.

547
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:22,351
Or in her case, a side window boy.
What else has she been deprived of?

548
00:31:22,435 --> 00:31:24,364
She's on a special diet
because of her allergies.

549
00:31:24,476 --> 00:31:29,216
The boyfriend brings the hot beef.
He also brings a side dish: botulism.

550
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,331
This is paralysis is
ascending, remember?

551
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:33,807
Not if the heart problem's
really a paralytic problem.

552
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,774
Why would she admit the sex
and not the food?

553
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:37,909
She didn't admit anything.

554
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:40,835
He admitted the sex, and
we didn't ask him about food.

555
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:41,906
Get me a rat.

556
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,818
- You have a rat.
- What?

557
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,996
I'm not gonna kill Steve.

558
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:47,827
Only way to confirm this...

559
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:52,846
inject the rat with her blood and wait
for it to get all botulistic on your ass.

560
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:57,879
In the meantime,
I'm going downstairs to browbeat
a scared, dying teenage girl until she...

561
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:01,428
breaks down like
a scared, dying teenage girl.

562
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,173
- You're up early.
- Cuddy needed a consult.

563
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:10,967
We're checking for
spinal lesions from leukemia.

564
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:13,607
Yeah, I know.
Fits perfectly.

565
00:32:13,754 --> 00:32:16,755
Unless this is the patient with
the anaphylaxis, the heart failure, 

566
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,072
and the paralysis, in which case,
you're wasting your time.

567
00:32:19,156 --> 00:32:20,419
We wanted a second opinion.

568
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:22,500
Second? We must have
given you at least eight.

569
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:24,473
Okay, well here's nine.

570
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:27,615
Botulism.

571
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,165
Listen to me.
Have you eaten anything abnormal?

572
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:31,995
- Any canned foods?
- No.

573
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:37,682
You sure? Lying to your parents is
usually the right thing to do, but
there is an impending death exception.

574
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:39,009
Don't talk to her like that.

575
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:41,987
You're right. She never lies.
I was being rude.

576
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:44,167
When your boyfriend
snuck in on Friday night--

577
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:45,849
surprise--

578
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:48,718
perhaps he got you some
sexy little treats, huh?

579
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:54,004
Some honey or some edible underwear,
some massage oils. Come on, anything.

580
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:55,708
[Gags]
We didn't--

581
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,720
Yeah, yeah,
we know about the sex.

582
00:32:57,824 --> 00:33:00,471
Turns out that Danny's
little Danny is full of penicillin.

583
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:02,624
That's what caused
your anaphylactic shock.

584
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:04,189
You didn't tell us that's what--

585
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:10,078
It was--
He took clindamycin.
What I use.

586
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:14,410
He said he was on penicillin.

587
00:33:14,512 --> 00:33:15,700
I saw the bottle.

588
00:33:15,803 --> 00:33:17,866
It's a non-penicillin antibiotic.

589
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,623
If the antibiotics didn't
cause the anaphylaxis...

590
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,282
It's still on the table.

591
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:23,942
Everything is connected.

592
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:25,895
What did we discuss?
What was the differential?

593
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:27,577
Cameron said...

594
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:33,801
When Dan came to your house that night,
did he go through any tall grass?

595
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:35,799
Climbed a fence.

596
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,568
What are you doing?

597
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:44,771
Your daughter had
two visitors on Friday night.

598
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:46,598
One of them is still in the room.

599
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:49,391
She has tick paralysis.

600
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:53,602
Dan tracked a tick onto his jeans,

601
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:55,974
which wouldn't be a problem.
But being a teenager,

602
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:58,237
Dan couldn't keep
his tick in his pants.

603
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:00,165
Foreman:
We already checked her.

604
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,135
Now I'm checking her.

605
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:04,798
Tick bites don't ordinarily
cause anaphylactic shock.

606
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,789
This girl's allergies
are not ordinary.

607
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:10,291
House, get out of here.
We have to re-intubate her,
get her into the MRI.

608
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,977
The time course is perfect.

609
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:14,195
The bite itself sets off
an allergic reaction.

610
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:18,301
Venom takes four days to kick in,
heart's vulnerable, hits that first,

611
00:34:18,386 --> 00:34:20,447
and a day later sets off
the ascending paralysis.

612
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:22,456
Except that ticks
aren't usually invisible.

613
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,216
They are until you find them.

614
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:30,069
Oh no, that's dandruff.
That wasn't nearly
as dramatic as I'd hoped.

615
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,254
Just means the next time
it'll be even better.

616
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:34,800
[Monitors start beeping]

617
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:36,423
What's happening?

618
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,225
That's the tick venom ascending.

619
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,551
That or you stressed her
into heart failure. BP's dropping.

620
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,202
- Heart rate, 47.
- I'm administering atropine.

621
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:46,747
She's going to need
a transvenous pacing wire.

622
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:48,900
Okay, magical tick hunt is over.

623
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:50,618
Only real doctor stuff now.

624
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,524
This is just gonna get worse.

625
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:55,539
Ticks produce more toxins
the longer they feed.

626
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:58,832
She's gonna be dead in an hour
even if you pump her heartfull of jet fuel,

627
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,568
unless you let me find the tick.

628
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:01,414
Could he be right?

629
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:06,064
The only thing I know for sure is
that your daughter's heart won't last
another 20 minutes without treatment.

630
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:07,952
Okay, I just need
one final instruction.

631
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:10,685
When I find the tick on the autopsy,
do you want to know?

632
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:13,139
I'm thinking not.
Probably make the coping easier.

633
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:14,707

634
00:35:14,788 --> 00:35:17,446

Get her team down here stat.

635
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,011
Get them out of here.
Get House out of here, too.

636
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:20,880
Dr. Wilson, I could use your help.

637
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:24,702
Well, I don't know
if the dopamine's enough.

638
00:35:24,871 --> 00:35:26,554
She may need
inamrinone lactate.

639
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:28,080
Why? What's that?
She doesn't--

640
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:30,956
She might need stronger pressors.
They don't have any in radiology.

641
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,297
Inamrinone can cause
arrhythmia and thrombocytopenia.

642
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:37,274
Not inamrinone could cause death.
Death's worse.

643
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,907
We have to get her up to the ICU.

644
00:35:54,557 --> 00:35:56,462

645
00:35:56,546 --> 00:35:57,955

650
00:36:13,196 --> 00:36:16,552
Well, as long as we're stuck here,
this might be a good time
to look for that tick.

651
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:18,001
Turn the elevator back on.

652
00:36:18,085 --> 00:36:19,539

Temporary's fine.

We've got to get her upstairs
and put her on norepinephrine.

658
00:36:36,955 --> 00:36:38,279
It wasn't penicillin.

659
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,844
You still think
the symptoms are unconnected?

660
00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:41,255

of her heart before--

your paint's peeling,
your curtains are gone,

Which problem do you deal with first?

663

- House--
- None of them!

We treat her symptoms, she dies.

We find the cause, she lives.

666
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:55,966
That tick is an I.V. drip of poison.
We unhook it, she'll be fine.

Left foot's clean.

678
00:37:38,951 --> 00:37:40,508
If it's not here,
we've only got--

679
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,718
[Beeping]
- Heart rate's 46.
- It's here.

680
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:46,522
Looks like a mole or a freckle.
Something we missed.

681
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:48,243
Check the armpits.

682
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:52,871
[Wheezes]

683
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:55,743
Dr. Foreman's an excellent doctor.
He'll be able to handle it.

684
00:37:55,743 --> 00:37:57,270
Yeah? You know that
from experience?

685
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:58,944
You lose a lot of patients
on elevators?

686
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:02,932
The maintenance guy said
it didn't just stop on its own, that
they hit the emergency stop button.

687
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:06,051
Well, I'm sure
he must be mistaken.

688
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:10,508
- Perineum.
- We checked it.

689
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:13,417
- If we get her upstairs--
- Maxilla.
- Checked.

690
00:38:16,284 --> 00:38:18,420
Down to 38.
We don't have a lot of time.

691
00:38:18,503 --> 00:38:21,239
Eyebrows, eardrums,
pubic hair.

692
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:23,592
Checked, checked, checked.
We checked everywhere!

693
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,142
It's not--
[beeping]

694
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:29,159
35. We got to get her to the ICU.

695
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:30,708
We haven't found the tick yet.

696
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,779
We already kidnapped her!
You want to add murder?

697
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,660
We've looked over every inch of skin on her body, House!

698
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:37,531
It's over.

699
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,664
Hey, is that the first time
you had sex?

700
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:54,194
With all the other stuff
going on down there,
she might not have realized.

701
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:55,806
Oh...

702
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,824
[Elevator dings]

703
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,291
You sick, miserable--

704
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:12,354
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God!

705
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:13,526
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

706
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:18,298
See? Told you it'd be
even more dramatic.

707
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:27,486
Push norepinephrine.
Get her heart back to normal.
She'll be completely cured by tomorrow.

708
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:31,897
Foreman, let's get her into the ICU.

709
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,384
Inamrinone was a stupid idea,

710
00:39:50,045 --> 00:39:52,317
unless you wanted me
to get that girl on the elevator.

711
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:53,816
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

712
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,518
Wouldn't respect you
if you did.

713
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:10,388
Wow. Looks like somebody filed
halfway through your cane
while you were sleeping.

714
00:40:36,862 --> 00:40:40,489
Reflexes back to normal.
Heart's looking good, too.

715
00:40:40,636 --> 00:40:45,216
I'll send in the nurse,
we'll get you transferred out of ICU,
you'll be discharged in the morning.

716
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:48,498
Thank God.
I just want to get home.

717
00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:50,992
And back to school
on Monday.

718
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:54,717
I'm-I'm not ready.

719
00:40:55,284 --> 00:40:56,923
You're ready.

720
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,216
I'm sick, Mom.

721
00:40:59,548 --> 00:41:01,248
You're not sick.

722
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,641
You're gonna go to class,

723
00:41:04,057 --> 00:41:07,316
and you're gonna see your friends
and your boyfriend.

724
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,483
[James Stewart on TV]
<i>What's this doohickey?</i>

725
00:41:18,444 --> 00:41:20,114
Barbara Bel Geddes:
<i>It's a brassiere.</i>

726
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:23,446
Bel Geddes:
<i>You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.</i>

727
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:25,850
James:
<i>Well, I've never across one like that.</i>

728
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:30,481
Bel Geddes:
<i>It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift.
I've explained to you--</i>

729
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:35,997
Stewart:
<i>I know, I know. I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo. And I get dizzy.</i>

730
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:39,956
Stewart:
<i>What a moment to find out I had it.</i>

731
00:41:40,022 --> 00:41:44,285
Bel Geddes:
<i>You've got it, and there's no losing it.
And there's no one to blame. So why quit?</i>

732
00:41:44,286 --> 00:41:47,062
Stewart:
<i>You mean, and sit behind a desk,
chair-borne?</i>

733
00:41:47,063 --> 00:41:48,824
Bel Geddes:
<i>Where you belong.</i>

734
00:41:48,824 --> 00:41:50,497
Stewart:
<i>What about my acrophobia?</i>

735
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:52,716
I called a divorce lawyer today.

736
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:56,664
Does that mean you're leaving?

737
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,133
At some point.

738
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:08,098
You might not
wanna sit exactly there.
