1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,467
The trick to onions...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,734
cut them in half lengthwise,

3
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:07,101
but leave the roots on.

4
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:09,467
Then make your vertical slices.

5
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,333
Need a dozen. Think you can handle this?

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,801
A dozen is 12, right?

7
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:19,434
Next, we add mustard greens...

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,367
spicy, and they pack a nice punch.

9
00:00:22,434 --> 00:00:24,634
Plus, they're really good for you.

10
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:26,567
Improve mental function,

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,600
protect against rheumatoid arthritis.

12
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:31,801
Even inhibit certain types of cancer.

13
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:33,001
Are you going to chop those onions

14
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:34,567
or give them a thai massage?

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,867
Well, i guess a happy ending|is out of the question.

16
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:39,734
I don't recall adding|making snide remarks

17
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:42,767
to your list of duties.

18
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:44,300
Just taking initiative.

19
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,567
Secret ingredient: porcini mushrooms.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,333
You want to reconstitute|them in a bowl of water.

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,600
You also want to hire an assistant

22
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,467
who can stay focused for|longer than 30 seconds.

23
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:55,867
Why don't i hear you chopping?

24
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:57,834
Just give me a second.

25
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,233
You're kidding me, right?

26
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,634
So sorry. Are you okay?|You want to sit down?

27
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,867
My lips are blue. Cyanosis.

28
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:07,333
Pain in my back and chest.

29
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,267
Spontaneous pneumothorax.

30
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,233
What are you talking|about? I'm a doctor.

31
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,034
You are? And i need a doctor.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,834
You drool.

33
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:06,667
Shut up.

34
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
I know gas is expensive,

35
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,333
but i could've given you a ride.

36
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:09,901
Elevator's broken.

37
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:11,234
It was fine when i came up

38
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,867
from admitting.

39
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:14,333
Dana miller, the cancer researcher.

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,500
Spontaneous pneumothorax.|Awfully thin file.

41
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,101
She just got admitted.

42
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:20,867
Lots of things can cause pneumothorax.

43
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,433
Why don't we let eight|or ten other doctors

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,467
rule out the boring stuff?

45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,767
We wanna take this case.

46
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,433
She's maybe five or ten years away

47
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,867
from curing retinoblastoma.

48
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:30,500
Which would make this|case attractive to anyone

49
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:33,600
who has some vested interest|in people curing the incurable.

50
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:34,433
She hasn't suffered from copd.

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,767
She doesn't smoke.

52
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,634
She hasn't been scuba diving.

53
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,500
O2 sats are low even|after chest tube insertion.

54
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:41,801
Pneumothorax could be|secondary to a bunch of things.

55
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:43,433
Cystic fibrosis, lung cancer.

56
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,034
Or, to be slightly more optimistic,

57
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,333
late-onset asthma triggered|by an unknown allergen.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,001
We have a case? Did|you just get to work?

59
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,400
Am i in trouble?

60
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:54,801
Did you take the elevators up? Yes.

61
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,034
So, steroids for asthma?

62
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,934
Yeah.

63
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:02,400
Do a ct looking for|hyperinflation to confirm.

64
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:10,134
I thought my hospital was high-tech.

65
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,901
I'd have to wait all day for a ct.

66
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,801
Dr. House gets a few perks.

67
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,500
He has his own scanner?

68
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:18,034
No, just very loose interpretations

69
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,400
of hospital procedure.

70
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,400
I appreciate the extra effort, but...

71
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,801
our gift to society.

72
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:24,634
We want to get you back to|work as soon as possible.

73
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,001
Well, i'm not working.

74
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,934
At least not as a doctor.

75
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,734
I quit.

76
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:33,634
I left eight months ago.

77
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,601
You mean, like, a sabbatical?

78
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,467
I had a uterine myoma. Benign.

79
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:42,067
But it ruptured and i|needed emergency surgery.

80
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:43,701
I was lying there on the table thinking,

81
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:45,868
"i can't die now. I|haven't been happy yet."

82
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,734
Couldn't you just buy an|overpriced german sports car,

83
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,334
or have an affair?

84
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:55,167
My sports car is doing|what i want when i want.

85
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:56,701
Right now i'm learning|how to run a kitchen

86
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:58,067
from one of the best chefs in new york.

87
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:01,567
You're washing pots and smashing garlic?

88
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,768
Smashing garlic makes me happy.

89
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:05,868
Before that it was eight years studying,

90
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,234
12 years in that lab.

91
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,200
It was always what i was supposed to do,

92
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:10,701
and never what i wanted to do.

93
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,334
Come here. Look at this.

94
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,634
Come here.

95
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:33,768
Adorable. Elevators keep crashing.

96
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,868
Is mercury in retrograde or what?

97
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,567
Elevators can be capricious.

98
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:40,768
Sometimes it just seems|like they're out to get you.

99
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:42,134
She keeps playing with the blanket.

100
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,234
Why would she do that?

101
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,334
Why do you think the elevators

102
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,868
would be out to get me?

103
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,300
I don't know.

104
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:50,868
Maybe they wanted to take time off

105
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,667
to spend with their little dumbwaiter.

106
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:54,967
But they the had to leave it|at home with an elevator sitter

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,900
because you drove the|replacement elevator

108
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,167
to quitting

109
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,667
because you're incapable of|listening to anybody but me.

110
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,467
That's just a theory.

111
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:05,933
You're wrong. I don't|even listen to you.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,667
Either do your job or go|home. Leave me out of it.

113
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:09,967
I am gonna do my job.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,534
It doesn't mean i have to do it happily.

115
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,734
Doesn't mean i have to|do it without resentment.

116
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,434
And it definitely doesn't|mean i have to do it

117
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,200
without seeking vengeance on|the person making me be here.

118
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:19,900
Congratulations.

119
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:22,033
You've officially dragged|me down to your level.

120
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,200
Okay.

121
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:50,868
Hey, blue.

122
00:06:58,467 --> 00:06:59,667
It's not asthma.

123
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,601
Lung volume is normal.

124
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,334
She did have a uterine myoma|removed eight months ago.

125
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:06,900
Central line iv could have|made a hole near the lung

126
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,567
that slowly expanded.

127
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:09,834
No pleural thickening.

128
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,000
I can't believe she quit.

129
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:15,167
People have the right to be happy.

130
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,534
I saw a four-year-old|with retinoblastoma

131
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,634
on my oncology rotation.

132
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:21,467
The cancer had eaten through|her eye and into her brain.

133
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:22,801
Horrible diseases exist.

134
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,267
It doesn't mean people should give up

135
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,768
recreational anything.

136
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:27,234
Why not? Big picture...

137
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,701
i don't care if jonas salk's life

138
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:29,967
is a miserable shell.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,567
I just want him to cure polio.

140
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,434
You can't live your life "big picture."

141
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:34,567
You've gotta look out for yourself

142
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:35,701
and the people you care about.

143
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,534
Well, then, why are you a doctor?

144
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,534
Why aren't you sitting by a pool in fiji

145
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:40,000
knocking back mai tais?

146
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:41,734
People act in their own self-interests.

147
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:43,933
You're all here because|you're happy to be here.

148
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,534
Or at least because|it's your best option.

149
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,634
I'm here because i want to help people.

150
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,801
No, you're here because

151
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,167
it makes you feel good to help people.

152
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:52,567
Taub and foreman are here because

153
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:54,234
they've got no other viable choices.

154
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,701
And thirteen is desperate|to make her life matter

155
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:58,367
before it's over.

156
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,434
So... you're happy to be here?

157
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,801
Does it show?

158
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:06,701
Are those... increased|interstitial markings?

159
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:08,501
Could be pulmonary fibrosis.

160
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:10,401
Do a biopsy.

161
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,967
Foreman.

162
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:20,367
"You've got to look out for|the people you care about."

163
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,868
That wouldn't have|anything to do with you

164
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,768
screwing over your clinical trial

165
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,900
by slipping thirteen|the real drug, would it?

166
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,734
You said that would be stupid.

167
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:30,601
Does she know?

168
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,734
Because jonas salk would not approve.

169
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:35,567
There's nothing to know.

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,601
Got it?

171
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:49,000
Good? Yep.

172
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,267
You okay?

173
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:54,000
Just a headache. I took|some ibuprofen, but...

174
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:54,967
where's the pain: front or back?

175
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,234
Front.

176
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:57,501
Why are there never|any interesting pictures

177
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:58,834
on these cards?

178
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,868
They should make a dirty version.

179
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,967
A sharp pain, or more of a throbbing...

180
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:06,967
relax, it's not a side|effect. People get headaches.

181
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,467
True, but i can get you an mri.

182
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:11,567
If i'm on the drug, it's been weeks.

183
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,601
It's not like something's|going to suddenly crop up now.

184
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,367
Okay.

185
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:20,100
First card.

186
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:24,000
Train, duck...

187
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,401
you can't remember?

188
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,734
Piano.

189
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,933
We need a biopsy to confirm...

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,134
you need an open-lung biopsy|to confirm pulmonary fibrosis.

191
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,234
That's invasive surgery.

192
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:38,933
I'd be out of commission for weeks.

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,601
No offense, but you're not working.

194
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,334
What does it matter if you|spend a little time in bed?

195
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:45,534
Not working doesn't mean|i don't have places to go.

196
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:48,334
I've got my book group, piano|lessons, cooking classes.

197
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:49,801
They make me happy.

198
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,768
A warm apple fritter makes me happy.

199
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,834
It doesn't fulfill me as a person.

200
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,134
And working here does?

201
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,234
If it didn't, i'd have found a way

202
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,000
to go back to tucking tummies.

203
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,434
Well, good for you.

204
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:01,134
If your job fulfills you and|makes you happy, that's rare.

205
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,267
I didn't say i was happy.

206
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,367
I loved being a plastic surgeon.

207
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:09,000
The money, the lifestyle.

208
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,167
And in a lot of ways this job stinks.

209
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,467
I'm making five bucks, i'm|always annoyed... but...

210
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:17,868
you can look yourself|in the mirror and think,

211
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,900
"i did something worthwhile today."

212
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,401
Exactly.

213
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:25,601
Well, that's important.|And i do miss that.

214
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,200
But it just wasn't enough anymore.

215
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,601
That doesn't feel right.

216
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:37,933
Sit up.

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,267
Ow! Oh, that's weird.

218
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,100
What is it? Ascites?

219
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,834
First her lung deflates,|like me after a cold shower.

220
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:02,934
Now her liver starts to|bleed, like me after...

221
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,467
you okay?

222
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,001
Great.

223
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:15,567
Just practicing my|clown college audition.

224
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,667
Someone set a trip wire.

225
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,400
We were with the patient the whole time.

226
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,001
We were in the grc.

227
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:24,367
Lung, liver, go.

228
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,233
Shouldn't you be obsessing|over who did this to you?

229
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,567
Nope... anybody bother

230
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,267
mriing our patient's liver for tumors?

231
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,567
Uh, no tumors, no|cysts, no clear etiology.

232
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,867
If you're not obsessing,

233
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:38,500
you must have already figured it out.

234
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,901
Yes.

235
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,333
So i'm obsessing about|why you're not obsessing

236
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,567
about why our patient's|liver suddenly sprang a leak.

237
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:46,101
There's a tiny spot on the caudate lobe.

238
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:47,467
Could be a granuloma.

239
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:49,500
Erodes into the hepatic artery,

240
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,901
causes the bleed.

241
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,434
What caused the granuloma?

242
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,701
Blastomycosis.

243
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:56,200
Could have been asymptomatic for months.

244
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:59,034
It hits her lungs, we give her steroids.

245
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:01,200
It blossoms and attacks her liver.

246
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,567
Get a piece of her lung,|stick it under a black light.

247
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,967
If it glows, sick children|who need her souffles

248
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:08,634
can breathe easier.

249
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:10,667
Foreman.

250
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,467
Again?

251
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,200
You have a problem.

252
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,333
I told you, i didn't...

253
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,600
then you really have a problem.

254
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:24,367
They way she turned her|head to look at the mri...

255
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:25,834
i think she's losing|her peripheral vision.

256
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,400
Because she turned her head?

257
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,701
I'm happy for you.

258
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:33,567
A love so deep you're ready|to chuck your medical license

259
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:35,101
to give her powerful, unproven drugs

260
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,801
with dangerous side effects.

261
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,001
I don't want to make any assumptions

262
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:40,367
about your feelings for me,

263
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,634
but i do have a birthday coming up.

264
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:58,267
I hear cuddy's seal training|finally came in handy.

265
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,567
Should i be investing in a flak jacket?

266
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:01,901
You're safe.

267
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:04,467
No carpet bombing?

268
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:08,634
No burning of dresden|to teach her a lesson?

269
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,734
Well, since you're incapable|of taking the high road,

270
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,867
i assume there's some deeper,

271
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:14,967
more long-term strategy in effect.

272
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,834
Cuddy's not playing games.

273
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:18,801
She's not looking for leverage.

274
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,300
She wants pure, unadulterated vengeance.

275
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,200
And your counter-move|is to let her have it?

276
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:26,801
The only time to strike back|is when i want something.

277
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,634
All i want now is to get|things back to normal.

278
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,467
Which i can't get by escalating.

279
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:34,034
The only way to win|this war is to lose it.

280
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:35,667
Let her punch herself out.

281
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:38,901
Yeah, that makes sense too.

282
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:41,001
"Too"?

283
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:42,200
I was thinking you actually feel guilty

284
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:43,967
about taking her away from her baby.

285
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,333
But your explanation's good too.

286
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,300
It's completely inconsistent|with your character, but...

287
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:51,934
thank you, rationalization man.

288
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,300
You have saved the village.

289
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,734
You wanna eat?

290
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,801
You forgot your file.

291
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:01,534
Dana miller?

292
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,267
The cancer researcher?

293
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,667
Not anymore.

294
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,834
Dr. Miller, i doubt if|you'll remember me...

295
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,233
james wilson, right? Chicago.

296
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,767
The adenocarcinoma conference.

297
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:22,434
Impressive.

298
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:24,500
You want some cortisone for that itch?

299
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,267
Liver failure.

300
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,134
Itching is one of the|lovely side effects.

301
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,867
Why did you quit?

302
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:35,300
The worst thing is is|now every time i get sick,

303
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,134
i have to listen to a|dozen people judge me.

304
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,667
Do you want me to congratulate you?

305
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,400
I've got four kids in ped-onc right now

306
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:43,600
who are gonna die.

307
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,034
Three of them within a year,

308
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,333
the other in a few days, probably.

309
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,333
Breakthroughs will happen.

310
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,901
With or without me, someone|will find the answer.

311
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:53,867
Maybe.

312
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,200
I... i...

313
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,500
i'm in the trenches.

314
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,901
I'm... i'm doing triage as best i can.

315
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:04,267
You had the chance to end the war.

316
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,068
How is someone like me|supposed to keep fighting

317
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:09,267
when someone like you|just... walked away?

318
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,567
When i left my job,

319
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,834
a lot of people were furious with me.

320
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:19,467
It was easier to be angry than|to admit they weren't happy.

321
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,134
That they were stuck in a|rut somewhere in their lives,

322
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:25,168
unable to move forward.

323
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,068
What's your rut?

324
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:42,267
Okay, you're freaking me out.

325
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,267
Do you think we should have kids?

326
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:54,200
We've had this|conversation. Ten years ago.

327
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:55,734
Things change.

328
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:58,801
On our third date i told you|that i didn't want to have kids,

329
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,767
and you said that you|were okay with that.

330
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,534
I said it because i|wanted to sleep with you.

331
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,467
And then i fell in love with you.

332
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:09,333
And i realized that i|really could be okay with it.

333
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:12,967
It wasn't like i had this|burning desire to have children.

334
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:15,200
God, have you been|resenting me all this time?

335
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,600
Is that why... no.

336
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:20,634
Of course not.

337
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:23,801
I'm just... revisiting.

338
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:31,001
This isn't a whim for me.

339
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:33,701
It's not a decision that i made lightly.

340
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:35,068
Don't you ever wonder|what it would be like?

341
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:39,434
All the time.

342
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:41,434
Just not enough to|make me want to do it.

343
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,901
I like our life.

344
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:49,934
Are you okay?

345
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,834
Could you turn the tv back on?

346
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Look straight ahead.

347
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,300
Why didn't we do this test this morning?

348
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,567
You see that?

349
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:22,500
No. Damn.

350
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:27,134
I'm losing my peripheral vision?

351
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:32,168
I am on the drug.

352
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,967
Does this mean you have to tell them

353
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,134
and take me off it?

354
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,867
No, and yes.

355
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,567
As far as they're concerned,|you're on the placebo.

356
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:45,034
I found out last week.

357
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:48,967
The trial was getting|positive results...

358
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,701
so i switched you.

359
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,667
So my headaches...

360
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:03,034
i'll stop taking the drug,|and everything should be fine.

361
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:11,834
Specimen's negative for blastomycosis.

362
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,134
That's it?

363
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,333
I'll go give house the test results.

364
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,001
You can tell the patient.

365
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:20,233
Hey.

366
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:25,934
We've been dating for two weeks.

367
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:30,500
You just broke trial protocol|and risked your entire career

368
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,600
to give me a drug we're|not even sure will help me.

369
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,767
I don't think i'm ready for that.

370
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,767
Dr. Miller?

371
00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:51,967
Mm... i'm sorry.

372
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:53,701
The test was negative.

373
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,034
So i'm gonna take you off...

374
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,233
what happened to your head?

375
00:18:57,267 --> 00:19:00,068
I don't know. I was sleeping.

376
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:01,134
It's so itchy.

377
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:02,634
You were scratching it in your sleep.

378
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:08,333
You scratched right through your skull.

379
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,734
This is brain matter.

380
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,300
Need some help in here!

381
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:16,634
I did a free flap closure|to avoid any scarring.

382
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,801
She was lucky... the scratching|didn't cause any brain damage.

383
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,434
But the first thing she|said when we woke her up was

384
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:21,734
it still itches.

385
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:24,100
Itch receptors are only

386
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:26,067
in the top two layers of skin.

387
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:27,667
Which means she's not actually itchy,

388
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:28,933
she just thinks she is.

389
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,401
So the problem's in her brain?

390
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:31,634
Thank god we have you here|to interpret that for us.

391
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,567
Sorry, i have a headache.

392
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,801
Could be psychogenic.

393
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,467
She made big, sudden change in her life.

394
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:40,634
Could be the result|of a mental imbalance.

395
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,334
She wants to do what she wants to do.

396
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:44,100
What's crazy about that?

397
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:45,434
Why do you have to quit to do it?

398
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:46,900
If i want to do something, i do it.

399
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,667
If you can figure out a|balance, there's no burnout.

400
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,367
Thanks for the lesson, deepak.

401
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:53,134
The itching started yesterday,|not eight months ago.

402
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,634
Meningitis, encephalitis...

403
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,667
those are diffuse|processes. This is localized.

404
00:19:57,701 --> 00:19:59,768
Could be plaques.

405
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,334
Ms would explain, possibly the lungs.

406
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,801
So would a brain tumor.

407
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,834
Well, how 'bout we stop guessing

408
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:06,134
and mri her head instead?

409
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,300
You want to talk about your headaches?

410
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:33,167
Not particularly.

411
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:36,267
You went off the drug, but|the headaches are worse.

412
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,967
You need an mri.

413
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,300
The patient needs an mri.

414
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:41,801
If she had gangrene, would|you be amputating my leg?

415
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:43,768
Those pills have codeine in them?

416
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:46,067
You're taking twice|the indicated amount.

417
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,601
I've only been off|the drug for 24 hours,

418
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:50,000
so i think the bigger issue here

419
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,768
is that i've been off you for 24 hours.

420
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:54,501
You have worsening headaches,|loss of peripheral vision,

421
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:57,033
and a long history of pretending|bad things aren't happening.

422
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:59,601
You really think this is|just about my hurt feelings?

423
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,100
I don't remember demoting you.

424
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,234
I brought you something.

425
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:15,634
The latest issue of parent magazine.

426
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:18,367
Really interesting column.

427
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:20,467
Apparently, working moms|are actually more engaged

428
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:21,900
and attentive than|stay-at-home moms.

429
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:23,868
Something about personal fulfillment.

430
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,167
That's just a rationalization|by working moms to justify

431
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,467
not being with their kids.

432
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:29,701
Which is fine, if that's what they want.

433
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:31,300
It's not what i want.

434
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,768
And this is nurses quarterly.

435
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,267
The point is... you're|only here to get back at me

436
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:37,634
by dumping dirty mop water on my carpet.

437
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:39,801
Just get it over with so|i can get back to work.

438
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:05,367
I'm sorry.

439
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:07,167
I figured...

440
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,933
i don't know, one of us|needed to go out on a limb.

441
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,933
I thought i could help you.

442
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,234
It's hard to have a conversation

443
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:18,434
when i'm trying not to move.

444
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:27,933
Oh, god.

445
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:31,100
Patient's mri was negative.

446
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:32,300
No tumors, no lesions.

447
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:33,334
Where's your cane?

448
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:34,801
Where are your coworkers?

449
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:35,933
I paged them.

450
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It could still be psychogenic.

451
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:39,234
Technically, it can't still be that,

452
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,634
because it never could be that.

453
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,167
She scratched through her|skull while she was sleeping.

454
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,701
Unless she was having|a dream about fleas...

455
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:47,768
oh, hey! Funny you should drop by.

456
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,701
We were just talking|about this patient of ours.

457
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,067
Tell him the part about|where two of her doctors

458
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,534
don't show up... where are you going?

459
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,100
Polyneuropathy.

460
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,667
If it's not in the|brain, it's in the nerves.

461
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:58,334
It explains the itching,|the lungs, the liver.

462
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:00,033
Shock the affected|area, reboot the nerve...

463
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:01,634
she'll be fine.

464
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:02,768
Foreman.

465
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,601
How bad is she?

466
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:16,434
She's got a tumor in her optic chiasm.

467
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:17,967
You don't need your|coat to treat a tumor.

468
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:19,768
I'm going to the drug company.

469
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:22,701
To tell them that you|compromised their trial,

470
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,100
your ethics, and the patient's health?

471
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:25,601
That's a great idea.

472
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,634
They have records on|hundreds of patients.

473
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,501
I can ask them for access,

474
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,167
find out if other|patients developed tumors

475
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,267
and how they were treated.

476
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,067
This drug inhibits cell death.

477
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:35,434
I think i could take a wild guess

478
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,434
at how i treat that.

479
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:37,868
Stop taking it?

480
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,234
Yeah.

481
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,467
She tried that yesterday.

482
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:42,334
Oh, my god, it's been a whole day,

483
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:43,967
and her brain tumor hasn't melted away?

484
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:46,868
If you get on that elevator,

485
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:48,267
and it's only 'cause you're worried

486
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:49,634
about getting to sleep tonight...

487
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,100
i want to be able to tell her

488
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:52,768
this happened to other|people, and they're fine now.

489
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,067
So tell her.

490
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:55,601
I'm not gonna lie to her.

491
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:56,967
A little late for that.

492
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:02,300
You need to wait.

493
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:03,868
Because if this thing doesn't go away,

494
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:06,000
she's gonna need you to|still have a medical license.

495
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,167
So i spoke with house.

496
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,601
He thinks we should just...

497
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:15,200
my leg is bleeding.

498
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,234
What happened?

499
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:18,267
I was going for the phone,

500
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:20,634
and i fell over the table.

501
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:23,634
I can't see.

502
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:25,434
What do you mean?

503
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,401
I can't see anything.

504
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:46,601
You gonna tip housekeeping?

505
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:49,067
Get it from cuddy.

506
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:50,334
Don't tell me...

507
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:52,967
she burned your apartment to the ground.

508
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,300
The warmth would have been nice.

509
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:57,167
No heat, no power.

510
00:24:57,234 --> 00:25:00,200
Apparently mrs. House|called the utilities

511
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:01,467
and told them we were moving.

512
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,100
You have 17 messages.

513
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,167
And your non-involvement strategy

514
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,801
doesn't seem to be working.

515
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,567
Hang up, he's here.

516
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:19,434
We've been paging you all night.

517
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:20,701
By all means, let's discuss

518
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:22,134
the failed attempts to contact me,

519
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,467
not the reason behind them.

520
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,534
Patient started|experiencing spinal shocks

521
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:27,734
before the machine was turned on.

522
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:28,834
Lhermitte's sign.

523
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,401
Shocks without shock,

524
00:25:31,434 --> 00:25:33,200
an itch that won't stop.

525
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,200
She needs dr. Seuss.

526
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,300
Lhermitte's sign could mean|behcet's, b-12 deficiency.

527
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,200
No sores, no anemia.

528
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:41,033
Where's foreman? No idea.

529
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,267
Could be another demyelinating disease.

530
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,434
Why are you asking about|foreman and not thirteen?

531
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:49,601
Because both questions are|bound to have the same answer.

532
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:52,200
Ebony and ivory are joined near the hip.

533
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:53,933
Forget the brain. Look lower.

534
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,534
The spinal tumor wouldn't|explain the liver or the lungs.

535
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,900
But an aggressive|spinal hemangioma could.

536
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,000
Go find it.

537
00:26:17,768 --> 00:26:19,000
You didn't answer the door.

538
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:21,900
Probably because i didn't|want to talk to anyone.

539
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:24,601
You can leave your stolen|key on your way out.

540
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:25,868
I was looking for foreman.

541
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,300
I figured...

542
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:31,567
you can't see.

543
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:36,234
Where is he?

544
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,601
On his way to the drug company.

545
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,000
Tell him to come back.

546
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:40,167
I'll dial.

547
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
If they can help.

548
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:42,734
You think that drug company

549
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,401
has a magic tumor wand that|no one else knows about?

550
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:46,667
You need radiation,

551
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,467
not ritual sacrifice.

552
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:54,267
He asked for my advice

553
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:56,801
before he switched you off the placebo.

554
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:59,567
I told him to do it if he loved you.

555
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:03,667
He only thinks he loves me.

556
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:04,734
It's the same thing.

557
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:06,900
Yes, he's an idiot.

558
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,167
You didn't ask him to do anything.

559
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:09,200
You're pissed off that he did.

560
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:11,067
So let him torch his career

561
00:27:11,134 --> 00:27:12,000
to pay for his sins.

562
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:17,234
Unless you actually feel|something for the idiot.

563
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:22,868
In which case, you might want|to tell him to turn around.

564
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:38,701
You're hurting him.

565
00:27:38,768 --> 00:27:41,601
Good, after all the|stunts he's pulled on me.

566
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,634
You're physically hurting him.

567
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:45,401
That's the point.

568
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:46,868
What's the point?

569
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,467
What do you think you're|going to accomplish?

570
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,434
House shouldn't be allowed|to make people miserable

571
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:53,134
without paying for it.

572
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:55,567
You're not miserable!|You're telling me how i feel?

573
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:57,567
You're here because you like this.

574
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,967
You like working with him.

575
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,267
Wow, if only i'd known i was having fun,

576
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:02,734
i wouldn't have canceled|the bouncy house.

577
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:06,033
Fire him, and go be|home with your new baby.

578
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:08,200
I like what he does for this hospital.

579
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:11,933
What he does is who he is.

580
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:12,967
And the same goes for you.

581
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,134
Slow down.

582
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,167
Unless you want to radiate|her heart instead of her brain.

583
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,267
Of course, then your problems|would actually all go away.

584
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,967
Thanks.

585
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,067
I'm not beating myself up|enough already over this.

586
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,534
Entering the left common carotid.

587
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,467
You broke the rules.

588
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:41,467
Girlfriend went blind.

589
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:42,933
You gotta be ready for losing

590
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,768
to be one of the possibilities.

591
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:47,200
You're at the carotid bifurcation.

592
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,801
I knew that giving her the drug

593
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:50,167
would be bad for me if i got caught.

594
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:52,634
I never thought it would be bad for her.

595
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:54,900
Nobody else was having|adverse reactions.

596
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,401
You did it because you love her.

597
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:01,601
Ironically, you never took|her into consideration.

598
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:04,900
Can't wait to see what you|get her for your anniversary.

599
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:08,900
Catheter's adjacent to the optic chiasm.

600
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:10,834
We're in position.

601
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,801
Nukey, nukey.

602
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:32,068
What's going on with everyone today?

603
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:34,367
It involves house,|foreman, and thirteen,

604
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,168
which means it's either|dumb, dangerous, or tragic,

605
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,534
or a combination.

606
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,967
I'm embracing my ignorance.

607
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:42,034
House was right about the hemangioma.

608
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:43,101
Looks fixable.

609
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,233
What's that?

610
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,467
Hemangiomas travel solo.

611
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,901
This thing has brought a friend.

612
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:53,567
Masses in her lungs and spine.

613
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,034
One in her pericardium.

614
00:29:55,068 --> 00:29:56,867
They're everywhere.

615
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,300
Classic mesothelioma.

616
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,001
It metastasized outward|to the spine and muscles.

617
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:07,001
Ah, the irony of it.

618
00:30:07,068 --> 00:30:08,567
Maybe she wouldn't be sick at all

619
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,333
if some other lazy cancer researcher

620
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,534
hadn't gone home early.

621
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,068
Where are foreman and thirteen?

622
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:15,867
Shouldn't you be saying,

623
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:19,068
"those weren't there when|we scanned her two days ago"?

624
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,134
Mesothelioma shouldn't grow this fast.

625
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,600
Good rephrasing.

626
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,734
Have wilson do a biopsy to confirm.

627
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:27,200
No.

628
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:28,600
Something weird is going on.

629
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:30,467
It involves our|colleagues... we should know.

630
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:31,500
You want us to treat the patient,

631
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:32,667
tell us what's going on.

632
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:35,034
Actually, all he needs us to do

633
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,834
is tell wilson to do something.

634
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,534
So...

635
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:43,233
you always blab to watch people react.

636
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:45,400
So not blabbing means you|don't want us to react,

637
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:46,701
which can't be good.

638
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:49,434
Is thirteen's headache|not just a headache?

639
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,600
If i check with admitting,|am i gonna find her name?

640
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,867
A little pinch.

641
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:05,300
I'm sorry about the other day.

642
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:07,001
I... unloaded on you.

643
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:09,333
And... you're not sorry.

644
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,168
You feel bad because|mesothelioma means i'm dying.

645
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:16,168
You're a good person. I|appreciate the sentiment.

646
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,467
I'm not apologizing|because you're dying.

647
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:21,034
I'm apologizing because you were right.

648
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:22,434
I am stuck.

649
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,600
My girlfriend died.

650
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,600
She was the only person i've|loved for a long time, and...

651
00:31:30,634 --> 00:31:32,134
i'm still living in her apartment.

652
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,901
I'm surrounded by her things.

653
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,300
I have left it all exactly where it was.

654
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,734
I don't know how to get unstuck.

655
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:47,734
The only wrong thing|is... to do nothing.

656
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:54,901
Yeah.

657
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,434
All right.

658
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,567
That's not supposed to happen.

659
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,134
Have you thought about|going to the drug company,

660
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,600
see if they can help?

661
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:21,300
I thought about it.

662
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:22,434
We need to give it more time.

663
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:23,767
It's been half a day.

664
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,300
This thing keeps growing,

665
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:26,467
there's other stuff in your brain

666
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:28,034
you might need later on.

667
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:29,634
If i were any other patient,

668
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,867
you'd both be in the|lounge, eating donuts.

669
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:33,467
You're not any other patient.

670
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,300
Right.

671
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,034
Any other patient,|you don't feel guilty.

672
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:39,434
But you don't get

673
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,801
to torch your career|to pay for your sins.

674
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,867
House told her to say that, didn't he?

675
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:47,467
Does that make it any less true?

676
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
You think he's right?

677
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,200
Who cares?

678
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:52,901
You're a hypocrite.

679
00:32:52,934 --> 00:32:55,667
You don't ask her if she|wants to be on the drug,

680
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:57,467
but when there's a chance|you could help her get better,

681
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,967
suddenly you're letting|her call the shots?

682
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:01,300
That's not being noble.

683
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:04,534
That's saving your own ass.

684
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:08,567
I'd feel worse if he|destroyed his career.

685
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,767
Mesothelioma doesn't bleed.

686
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,168
So what causes masses that do bleed?

687
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:17,267
Avm's secondary to schistosomiasis.

688
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,001
She'd be crawling with|worms. We'd have noticed it.

689
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:21,367
Gorham's disease and kasabach-merritt

690
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,801
can both cause super-aggressive|vascular tumors.

691
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:27,567
Patient's heart just stopped.

692
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,934
So what causes that?

693
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:34,068
Cardiac tamponade.

694
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:35,901
She's bleeding into her pericardium,

695
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:37,200
smothering her heart.

696
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:38,634
Syringe.

697
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:43,634
B.p.'s going back up.

698
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:44,767
It's working.

699
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:45,901
No, it's not... look.

700
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:56,901
We're transfusing platelets, ffp,

701
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,267
everything to try to keep her stable.

702
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,634
But we can barely keep|up with the blood loss.

703
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,534
At this rate, she could be|dead by the end of the day.

704
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,168
We need to resect the vascular tumors,

705
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:04,534
stop the bleeding.

706
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,667
Too late... no surgeon's|gonna touch her now.

707
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:10,300
Should we give up?|Just let her bleed out?

708
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:11,500
Don't be silly.

709
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:12,667
You know what that would do

710
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:14,367
to our malpractice insurance rates?

711
00:34:14,434 --> 00:34:16,333
We go on the offensive.

712
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,567
Cut off the invading army's supply line.

713
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,701
You're talking about embolization?

714
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,801
Cut off the arteries that|feed blood to the tumors,

715
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:24,567
they wither and die.

716
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,233
Start with the ones in her lungs.

717
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,467
If they get any bigger,

718
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,300
she's gonna have a hard time breathing.

719
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,934
So she'll have a hard|time telling us she's dead.

720
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:32,168
You can't kill the tumors

721
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:33,834
without also killing healthy tissue.

722
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:36,333
If we wipe out 3/4 of her lungs...

723
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
let's hope that running marathons

724
00:34:37,434 --> 00:34:39,068
wasn't on her happy list.

725
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:49,767
I found this.

726
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:52,367
Ahem.

727
00:34:52,434 --> 00:34:54,367
In the, uh, coat closet.

728
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:56,367
Where i hid it.

729
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,134
Thought i'd never see you again.

730
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:05,001
Little, little greg.

731
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:06,434
Yeah, you heard me right!

732
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:15,267
Well, you are who you are.

733
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,333
It's annoying, but...

734
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,333
it's not your fault.

735
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,101
It isn't about you.

736
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:23,500
I...

737
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:24,767
i'm sorry.

738
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:27,834
Because you were doing|this job perfectly

739
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:29,068
until the baby came along.

740
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:31,734
What?

741
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:34,168
I'm apologizing. Can't|you just accept my...

742
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:36,101
i accept.

743
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,734
We gonna have to do this|dance again in 28 days?

744
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:40,567
What the hell is wrong with you?

745
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:42,200
Yesterday, you hate me.

746
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,467
Today, you're practically|weeping on my shoulder.

747
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:46,500
I can only assume that what i'm hearing

748
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:49,600
is your aunt flow telling me...

749
00:35:57,168 --> 00:35:59,534
when i was being a jerk,|you suddenly act human.

750
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:02,434
But when i act human,|you turn back into a jerk.

751
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,767
Guess our cycles aren't matched up yet.

752
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:07,400
This is your way

753
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,333
of saying you accept|my apology, isn't it?

754
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,300
Nope, this is my way of saying

755
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:12,467
you were doing a crappy job before;

756
00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:14,400
you will a slightly crappier job now.

757
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:16,867
Everything keeps going. Nature of life.

758
00:36:16,901 --> 00:36:18,267
Nature of parenthood.

759
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:24,101
Or this whole thing is just an act.

760
00:36:24,168 --> 00:36:27,101
And you've gone back to the|part you think you need to play.

761
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:30,901
You should go talk to wilson.

762
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:34,168
Rationalization man|needs a faithful sidekick.

763
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,134
Now, rational man|needs to go save a life.

764
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:47,068
House.

765
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:49,134
If you're looking for|returnable bottles,

766
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,400
kutner's already cleaned it out.

767
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,333
Damn!

768
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:53,434
Oh, well.

769
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:54,500
That means the only thing

770
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,734
i'm gonna get out of this...

771
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:57,734
is a diagnosis.

772
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,934
So the nurses gave her|pads instead of tampons.

773
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:03,567
Is that diagnostically relevant?

774
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,134
Fact that the nurses had|to give her anything is.

775
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,101
Means she's bleeding from her uterus.

776
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,200
Women do that.

777
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:09,233
It's perfectly natural.

778
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,434
Not scary at all.

779
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,901
She menstruating

780
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:13,801
and she's bleeding everywhere.

781
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:15,734
There's about a 3 or 4 in 28 chance

782
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,500
it's a coincidence.

783
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,867
Which leaves a much bigger chance

784
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:21,600
that the diagnosis is|ectopic endometriosis.

785
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:23,867
She had a myoma eight months ago.

786
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:25,667
Surgeons cut through her uterine wall.

787
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,901
Every cut of the scalpel could|have sent endometrial cells

788
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:30,867
spilling out into her bloodstream.

789
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:32,400
Some of them took up|residence in her lungs,

790
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:34,267
some in her liver, some in her spine.

791
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,467
And like all horny little cells,

792
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,767
they went forth and multiplied

793
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:39,934
till they reached a critical mass.

794
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,567
In the days leading|up to her next period,

795
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,434
when her uterus is supposed to swell,

796
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,034
everything swelled.

797
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:46,967
And when her uterus|was supposed to bleed,

798
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:49,367
everything bled.

799
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,168
Yes, ladies, i am blaming her period.

800
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:54,068
Granted, it's the worst period ever.

801
00:37:54,134 --> 00:37:56,901
Although, frankly, not by all that much.

802
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,367
Cut out the masses, she'll be fine.

803
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,434
Can't do surgery

804
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,867
until her cycle's over

805
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:02,200
and she stops bleeding.

806
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:03,767
Well, let's hope she|can hold out till then.

807
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:06,068
In the meantime, get her a|pint of cookie dough ice cream

808
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:07,001
and a dvd of beaches.

809
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:34,967
I'm sorry.

810
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,701
Foreman?

811
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:45,967
I can see you.

812
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,300
How you feeling?

813
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:09,434
Relative to the last few days, awesome.

814
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:13,434
You almost died.

815
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:14,500
For the second time in eight months.

816
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,333
I know.

817
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:20,333
How do you feel about your|life choices this time?

818
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:22,834
I didn't lie there thinking "what if?"

819
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:28,168
I always worry, on my|deathbed i'll think,

820
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,333
"i didn't do anything really important."

821
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,434
You're gonna spend one day of your life

822
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:33,600
on your death bed.

823
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:35,567
The other 25,000

824
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,001
are the ones we should|be worrying about.

825
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:40,634
Go to bed happy tonight.

826
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:08,434
Dr. Schmidt.

827
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:12,101
It's eric foreman.

828
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:16,801
Um... actually, the trial|isn't going too well.

829
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:29,500
You told them, didn't you?

830
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:36,233
Well, you really had no choice...

831
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,667
on account of being an idiot.

832
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:40,367
They gonna pull the drug?

833
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,901
I broke protocol.

834
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:47,834
Her results are no longer|admissible to the trial.

835
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:49,734
They don't have to do anything.

836
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:50,834
Anyone else gets a tumor,

837
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:52,034
they'll put a warning on the label.

838
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,701
Gonna keep your license?

839
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,101
They'll come after me

840
00:40:55,134 --> 00:40:57,467
if i attempt to participate|in any more trials.

841
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,233
That's very decent of them.

842
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:05,168
Well, good for me.

843
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:07,467
I'll see you tomorrow.

844
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,200
And the next day.

845
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:11,667
And the next day.

846
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,034
That wasn't your locker, was it?

847
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:18,667
It's a lock-er room.

848
00:41:18,734 --> 00:41:20,233
How else are they gonna learn?

849
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,767
Do you think you can't|be happy without a kid?

850
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:40,300
I don't know.

851
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,767
I know i can't be happy without you.

852
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,500
You snore.

853
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:20,534
Shut up.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
