out him

350
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:31,400
because you didn't
trust me?

351
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:32,819
I just didn't want you
to get involved.

352
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:35,822
I'm already involved.
We're married.

353
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,540
It was the worst time
in my life.

354
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:39,325
I wanted to block it out.

355
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:42,879
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:44,630
I gotta get out of here.

357
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:48,751
Where are you going?
I don't know.

358
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,408
Hey...

359
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:58,060
So I'm seeing you tonight

360
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:00,663
yes. And you would have

361
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,998
even it you hadn't
told me that.

362
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:05,268
I was just wondering,
your masseuse...

363
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:07,837
Brandi.
I'm sure I'm imagining this,

364
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:10,289
although I'm not as sure
now that I know her name,

365
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:13,126
but she seems a little...

366
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,910
How do I say this?
I don't know.

367
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:17,913
Um, a bit slutty.
She <i>is</i> a hooker.

368
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:21,300
If she's not slutty,
she's doing something wrong.

369
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:24,604
What?
Did you have sex with her?

370
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:27,190
Yesterday?

371
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,859
Ah, you're getting
confused by the hooker thing.

372
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:32,979
No, of course not.
I'm dating you.

373
00:17:33,063 --> 00:17:35,982
But you used to
have sex with her.

374
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:38,934
Well, it was a massage

375
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:40,369
plus happy ending
sort of thing.

376
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:43,772
Now it's more of
a sad ending.

377
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:46,125
Because of you!

378
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:51,414
I've tried 15 different
massage therapists

379
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:52,832
over the last few years.

380
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,834
I don't know why,
but she's the best I've found.

381
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:56,836
She makes my leg
feel better.

382
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,589
So you really think that
I would be okay

383
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,507
with you getting a massage
from a hooker

384
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:03,025
you used to have sex with?

385
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:04,660
You don't mind
the massage part,

386
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:07,096
you mind the sex part,
which doesn't exist anymore.

387
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:08,797
I know a great
physical therapist.

388
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,150
I will give you
her number.

389
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:13,269
Why would I give up one
who definitely works

390
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
for one who <i>might</i> work?

391
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:15,988
Because I asked you to.

392
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:18,274
That's not really
an argument, now, is it?

393
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:21,861
I won't see you until
you stop seeing her.

394
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:27,049
Well, that's an argument.

395
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:31,254
How's our patient doing?

396
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:34,423
Well, she's stable,
but it's too early to tell

397
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:37,460
if the pralidoxime
is working.

398
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:38,678
Come on, go home.

399
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:40,580
You can't re-cram
all of med school right now.

400
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:43,182
I'm feeling a lot
of pressure here.

401
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,967
You were the Editor
of your school paper.

402
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:47,503
I think you know how
to deal with pressure.

403
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:49,972
No, I wasn't.

404
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:52,942
On your resume it said
"Rutgers <i>Daily Herald</i> Editor."

405
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,243
Didn't it?

406
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:55,928
I wasn't head
of the paper.

407
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:57,363
That's called
Editor in Chief.

408
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:58,614
I was just a writer.

409
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:01,617
<i>We're all called Editors.</i>
Ah.

410
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:03,869
Did you hire me
because of that?

411
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:05,621
Not entirely.

412
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:08,207
Look, if you're having
buyer's remorse...

413
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:10,576
Oh, no, uh, I'm not.

414
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:12,695
You might want to check out
volume two

415
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:17,700
on infectious diseases.
[pager beeping]

416
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:19,685
Patient's husband just got
admitted to the E.R.

417
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:33,099
Let's say you had
a really fantastic handyman...

418
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:35,034
I was hoping you'd
interrupt my cooking

419
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:36,686
to ask about handymen.

420
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:37,887
Do go on.

421
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:40,773
Would Sam ask you
to stop using him

422
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:42,775
because you might have had
a sexual relationship

423
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,510
with him in the past?

424
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:47,196
Ah, yes, the age-old
hooker massage conundrum.

425
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:48,731
Cuddy might have mentioned
something about it.

426
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,334
Let's say you're right.

427
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:52,735
Completely right
about everything.

428
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:54,370
Give in anyway.

429
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:56,672
This is not a point of pride.
This is a point of principle.

430
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,759
Right, you're the Rosa Parks
of hooker massages.

431
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:01,577
The principle is
she's being irrational.

432
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:03,346
If I give in on this,

433
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:05,264
it sets the stage
for the whole relationship.

434
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:06,515
Putting up with
irrationality

435
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,351
is the foundation
for every relationship.

436
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:11,053
I agree with Sam when she's
calling her father a monster.

437
00:20:11,104 --> 00:20:12,388
I agree with her when
she's calling him a Saint.

438
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:14,240
And in exchange, I get
to have sex with her.

439
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:16,625
And I'm sure she has
similar tradeoffs with me.

440
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,228
Relationships are hard.
You have to make sacrifices.

441
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:22,264
So sacrifice being crazy.

442
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:24,933
Go get her a gift
and apologize.

443
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:28,871
You finally made a good point.

444
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:32,158
Which, clearly,
you have misunderstood

445
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:33,559
based on how quickly
you agreed.

446
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:35,277
The kitchen's burning.

447
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:38,331
Oh...

448
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:41,300
We've got to get you
thinking like House.

449
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:43,252
The husband's in the E.R.
if he's got similar symptoms,

450
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:44,887
it could mean environmental.

451
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:46,555
Which helps
organophosphate theory.

452
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:48,957
Or maybe it's an infection,

453
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,394
which would mean we were wrong.
Exactly.

454
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:53,646
Or maybe he just got sick
with something else.

455
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,431
Coincidence?

456
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:56,965
Yeah.

457
00:20:57,017 --> 00:20:58,967
All right, here's one
big piece of advice.

458
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:02,638
House doesn't buy
coincidences.

459
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:04,640
Okay, it's not
environmental.

460
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:06,575
What happened to you?
What's it look like?

461
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:07,943
Looks like someone
kicked your ass.

462
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:09,945
What happened?
I looked in her address book.

463
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:11,497
There's a guy named Carl
in Brooklyn.

464
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:12,782
She told you to
stay away from him.

465
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,051
I'm not so good at following
direction sometimes.

466
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:20,005
I found him, I got angry,
which I also do sometimes.

467
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,791
He said he didn't know
what I was talking about.

468
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:23,659
He wouldn't let me in.
I got more pissed...

469
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,211
Next thing I know,
I'm on the floor

470
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:27,346
and he's called the cops.
You get arrested?

471
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:30,216
No, he didn't
press charges.

472
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,217
Well, you should
press charges.

473
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,334
If he tried
to poison her...

474
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:33,352
No, he really didn't know

475
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:35,054
what I was talking about.

476
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:36,972
He's just some guy
that Margaret--

477
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:38,474
damn it, that's
not even her name--

478
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,176
Jenny just--

479
00:21:40,243 --> 00:21:43,846
some guy that Jenny
used to work with.

480
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:47,850
I was stupid.
I just assumed that

481
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:51,370
the name Carl was...

482
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:54,156
I just wanted to find the guy
that poisoned my wife.

483
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:56,542
[Cell phone ringing]
What's up?

484
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:01,163
Pyrexia.
103 and rising.

485
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:03,466
I'll be right up.

486
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:06,001
Your wife just spiked
a fever.

487
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:07,720
What's that mean?

488
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,138
She wasn't poisoned.

489
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,667
(Chase)
What are you doing?

490
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,867
Just letting you all share
in the joys

491
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:23,219
of my last trip
to Carlsbad Caverns.

492
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:25,038
Which the husband probably
would have beaten up

493
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:26,572
if he'd found it
in the address book.

494
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:28,875
Would you mind standing
next to the screen?

495
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:31,377
Yeah, she'd love to become
a target for your ridicule.

496
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:32,679
She is not ready?

497
00:22:32,746 --> 00:22:34,964
Endocarditis?
Normal EKG.

498
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,250
No osler nodes.
Right, Dr. Kelly!

499
00:22:37,318 --> 00:22:38,635
Kelly's her first name.

500
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,719
What's your point,
Dr. Robert?

501
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,387
Run an echo.
I already did.

502
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:42,939
No vegetations.
Valves are clear.

503
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,140
Snapilicious!

504
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:45,775
But as I always like
to say,

505
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:48,394
it's better to be a helpful
Helen than a negative Nelly.

506
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,363
So while you're cooking up
some ideas of your own,

507
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,200
allow me to present theory 2.0
of why Chase hired you.

508
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:58,421
Dr. Kelly,
meet your doppelganger.

509
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:00,790
Oh, no.
Hold on a second.

510
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:02,659
<i>(Chase)</i>
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

511
00:23:02,743 --> 00:23:04,377
House...
<i>(Taub)</i>
<i>Is that...</i>

512
00:23:04,444 --> 00:23:08,447
That's baby Chase and his mom.
That's adorable!

513
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:11,000
Never mind the baby,
peep the babe.

514
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:13,586
<i>Note the cheekbones</i>
<i>and eye shape.</i>

515
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:15,388
They do actually
look alike.

516
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:16,406
<i>(House)</i>
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>

517
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:17,890
Chase wants to sleep
with his mom.

518
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,326
But who wouldn't hit that
if that looked like that?

519
00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:22,795
It's a classic case of what Freud called--
<i>stop.</i>

520
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:24,463
This isn't about
Chase's mother.

521
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:26,482
You're wrong.
What do you mean he's wrong?

522
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,101
<i>It is about your mom?</i>
No.

523
00:23:28,168 --> 00:23:30,637
So it's about...
<i>I'm assuming he thought</i>

524
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:32,488
I'd be a good member
of the team.

525
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:35,325
And on that subject,
what about Legionnaire's?

526
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:37,777
<i>Taub said he saw a rattly</i>
<i>old air conditioner</i>

527
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:39,245
in the patient's house.

528
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:40,697
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>if he saw her licking</i>

529
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:42,665
a petri dish of bacilli,
there's no lung involvement.

530
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,150
<i>All we know is</i>
<i>we don't see it.</i>

531
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:46,319
Dehydration from the fever
could hide the pneumonia.

532
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,956
Okay, forget
the mom theory.

533
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:53,426
Now water the patient,
treat for Legionnaire's.

534
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:54,627
(Foreman)
Hey, Taub.

535
00:23:54,678 --> 00:23:57,163
You didn't write up
the AC system.

536
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:58,881
Did you mention it to Kelly?

537
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:00,516
No.

538
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:01,968
<i>Did you mention it</i>
<i>to Chase?</i>

539
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:04,503
Yeah.

540
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:07,890
Whose idea was Legionnaire's?

541
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:10,109
Dr. Chase's.

542
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:12,511
Well, you get major points
for trying to trick me.

543
00:24:12,563 --> 00:24:16,149
Unfortunately, you lose 'em
all for failing.

544
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,484
Hold that. Hold that.

545
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:19,902
See, now you're frowning.

546
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,987
You can really see
the resemblance.

547
00:24:24,124 --> 00:24:25,408
So who gives a crap
if I prepped her?

548
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:28,411
Uh, House. And that's just
off the top of my head.

549
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:29,579
Why are you doing this?

550
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:31,030
You trying to
make me look bad

551
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:32,531
so you look better...
Or you don't like her,

552
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,233
or you're angry at me?

553
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:36,636
What?
We hire someone unqualified,

554
00:24:36,704 --> 00:24:38,304
it's just dead weight
we'll all be pulling.

555
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:40,256
Me especially.
You especially why?

556
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:42,075
What do you mean why?
Because I'm--
you're what?

557
00:24:42,142 --> 00:24:43,542
You're my boss
or something?

558
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:45,261
Something like.

559
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:47,296
So that's what it is.

560
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:49,098
You're angry that House
gave me the chance

561
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:50,549
to hire someone
because you still think

562
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:51,884
you're at a different level
to everyone else.

563
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:54,270
That's just pathetic.
I am at a different level.

564
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:56,239
Which is reflected
in what, exactly?

565
00:24:56,323 --> 00:24:58,775
Your title? No.

566
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:01,494
Ur salary?
Not really.

567
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,645
Your responsibilities?

568
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:05,431
Hardly.
Your attitude?

569
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:06,783
Ah.

570
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,951
I think we finally
found it.

571
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:10,586
It doesn't change the fact
that you made a bad decision

572
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:12,088
because you want
to get laid.

573
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:13,873
Or the fact that you're
courageously picking on Kelly

574
00:25:13,924 --> 00:25:15,208
because you're scared
to take on House.

575
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:17,293
Congratulations.

576
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:19,912
You're a real leader.

577
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:29,972
[Typing on keyboard]

578
00:25:30,057 --> 00:25:32,225
[Door opens]

579
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:36,729
[Thick latin accent]
I am Felipe.

580
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,764
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding.

581
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,017
Dr. House was worried
how you left things.

582
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:43,202
He's giving you
a massage.

583
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,388
As an admission he was wrong?
Yes.

584
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:48,941
Well, tell him thanks,
but I have a meeting

585
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:50,510
with Dr. Schatz
in 20 minutes.

586
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:52,462
He says you would say that,

587
00:25:52,546 --> 00:25:54,297
and to say no, you don't.

588
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:57,049
Well, tell him ne needs to
stop <i>canceling</i> my appointments,

589
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:59,085
because I will just
reschedule them.

590
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:04,390
He says you would say that,
and to say...Uh...

591
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:10,963
That "Dr. Schatz is a fat,
lonely moron who,

592
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:14,634
"in an effort to have contact
with human female,

593
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:16,936
"makes the same
exact complaint

594
00:26:17,004 --> 00:26:18,771
"about parking spaces
every month.

595
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:24,694
And you know you have to
stop enabling him."

596
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:28,364
I have great fingers.

597
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:35,705
[Sighs]

598
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:38,157
That's so nice.

599
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,528
Thank you.

600
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:44,781
How long have you been
a masseur?

601
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:48,234
What is that...
"Masseur"?

602
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:50,620
A massage therapist.

603
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:56,325
Oh, no, not long.

604
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,361
How did my boyfriend
find you?

605
00:26:58,428 --> 00:27:02,265
Boyfriend?
Dr. House.

606
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:05,551
He is your boyfriend?

607
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:08,171
Why is that surprising?

608
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:11,674
I just mean,
if he found me,

609
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:14,427
I do not think he's got
no girlfriend.

610
00:27:14,478 --> 00:27:17,980
Are you a prostitute?

611
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:19,765
Are you a cop?

612
00:27:19,817 --> 00:27:24,237
[Whispering]
Then no.

613
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:25,238
Get your hands off me.

614
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:33,682
I didn't know you smoked.

615
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:34,850
I don't.

616
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:40,889
I don't mind
screwing up.

617
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:42,024
I've screwed up
in my life,

618
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:43,275
and I've gotten over it.

619
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:45,277
But I'm not a cheater,
and I'm not a liar.

620
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,463
And now I feel like both.

621
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:53,118
You're right.
I'm sorry.

622
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:55,153
You work with House
and you kind of get

623
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:56,538
a messed-up perspective
of what's permissible

624
00:27:56,622 --> 00:27:57,522
in the workplace.

625
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:00,876
Maybe I should just quit.

626
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,711
No. You're smart.

627
00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:04,713
You're hard-working.

628
00:28:04,797 --> 00:28:07,416
Yeah, but I'm not like
you guys.

629
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,968
Use what makes you different.

630
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:12,204
A lot of this job is
reading people,

631
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:13,588
dealing with them.

632
00:28:13,673 --> 00:28:16,591
You're a psychiatrist...
Use your skills.

633
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:35,444
Are you okay?

634
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:38,780
I checked with
Trenton General.

635
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:41,333
There's no support group
for abused women.

636
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,234
Maybe it was just--

637
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:46,254
if she was lying about that,
what else is she lying about?

638
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:48,406
I mean, maybe she wasn't
even abused.

639
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:51,376
Maybe she's a criminal.
Who the hell knows?

640
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:53,762
You don't know.
That's the point.

641
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,580
<i>The way she's acting,</i>

642
00:28:55,631 --> 00:28:57,299
that's the way
abuse victims act.

643
00:28:57,383 --> 00:28:58,767
Their personalities
are affected

644
00:28:58,851 --> 00:29:00,619
by what they went through.

645
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:02,771
They find coping mechanisms.

646
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,140
I gotta talk to her
about this Trenton thing.

647
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:08,393
If you wake her up,
make her feel defensive,

648
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:09,761
it'll go bad.

649
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:11,446
She doesn't need
any more hostility

650
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:13,248
or aggression in her life.

651
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,787
Okay.

652
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:23,992
Seriously?

653
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:26,995
A massage
from a male hooker?

654
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,049
He was? Huh.

655
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:33,318
That doesn't bother me
at all.

656
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:35,120
I guess we both learned
a valuable lesson.

657
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:39,641
Except that I didn't used
to have sex with him, you idiot!

658
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:42,894
Plus, he was a <i>gay</i> hooker.

659
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:44,713
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

660
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,114
to find a straight
male hooker?

661
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:48,900
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

662
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:50,952
It's a massage.

663
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,121
I don't care
who gives it to you.

664
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:55,040
Why not treat me
the same way?

665
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:57,575
I'm sure that
some part of you

666
00:29:57,627 --> 00:29:59,244
believes this idiocy.

667
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:02,047
But you can't possibly
be stupid enough

668
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:04,433
to think that you can convince
any part of me.

669
00:30:04,517 --> 00:30:06,551
And that can only mean

670
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:09,771
you're trying to sabotage
this relationship.

671
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:12,991
Why would I do that?

672
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:14,526
We're doing fine.

673
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:17,145
Because the next step
from fine is serious,

674
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,480
and you can't handle that,

675
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:19,865
so you're trying to keep me
at arm's length

676
00:30:19,932 --> 00:30:21,266
with all this crap.

677
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:24,719
How about you?

678
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:27,389
I have been completely
open with you.

679
00:30:27,457 --> 00:30:30,842
You won't let me
sleep over.

680
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,627
You basically haven't
introduced me to your daughter.

681
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:35,080
But do you want to
spend time with her?

682
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:40,268
Honestly...Before this,
I'd have said no.

683
00:30:40,353 --> 00:30:43,588
But...Yeah.

684
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,357
How are we ever
gonna be a couple

685
00:30:45,424 --> 00:30:47,425
if you keep hiding her
from me?

686
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:50,862
House...

687
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,883
I need to protect her.

688
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:58,737
I let you into her life,
and you go away...

689
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:05,610
Call it what it is.

690
00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:07,913
I'm not the only one
who's holding back.

691
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,957
Hey, baby.

692
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:21,810
I am not getting mad.

693
00:31:21,894 --> 00:31:26,147
I'm just trying
to understand you here.

694
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:29,634
There's no meeting
like you talked about

695
00:31:29,685 --> 00:31:30,735
at Trenton General.

So let's assume
it's <i>something.</i>

What kind of something?
Abscess.

Or lymphoma,

713
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:46,778
We'd have to biopsy it
to be sure.

Any of them could explain
all of the symptoms.

You know, we're assuming
everything is connected.

Because it probably is.

are consistent

You know what, I'm back
to the Cameron theory.

726
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:15,740
That you hired
the dumb version of Cameron

Put a healthy person

they'd be chilled

She's a nice warm Merlot.

I didn't want her to freeze.

757
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,457
So you titrated the blanket.

758
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:40,976
As her fever dropped, you lowered the power.
Exactly.

759
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:44,479
So it's been on
the lowest setting since when?

it's not a coincidence.
You've gotta stop doing this.

But it could have been prompted
by the physical symptoms.

by the time we spoke
to the other hospital.

800

Because you knew
what was wrong with you.

810
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,911
Is it about your ex?

811
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:15,981
The ex was not so much
a secret, more of a lie.

for us to handle this.
Medically.

842
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,811
Look, if you want me
to give you a reason

843
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,730
to leave her, fine.

844
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:54,865
Apparently you haven't
noticed,

845
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,483
but she's got a serious
mental illness.

846
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,219
It's too hard.

00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,709
It's always hard.

848
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,461
Okay, so I made
a mistake.

849
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,463
Kelly will make
a fine doctor,

850
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:29,433
but she's not ready
for the team.

00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:32,469
Up to you.

852
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,522
What?
You like her now?

853
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,191
Nope. But she got me
to the right answer,

854
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:40,010
which none of the rest
of you did.

855
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:43,413

another shot, go for it.

Okay. I will.

00:39:48,202 --> 00:39:50,487
It'll make it easier
