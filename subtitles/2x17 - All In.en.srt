1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
The human heart is a giant muscle

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,862
squeezing our contracting
over 60 times each minute.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,376
That's 3,600... 

4
00:00:07,456 --> 00:00:10,814
At this point,
your blood is a deep purple.

5
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:15,343
Because it's just finished
dropping off oxygen for
all the parts of your body.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,742
Come on, follow me.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,021
Come on.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,006
Ian.

9
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:30,564
I have a question, and
I need to go to the bathroom.

10
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,363
Which would you like to do first?

11
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:34,196
- The question.
- Okay.

12
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:35,877
Where's the bathroom?

13
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,526
Who knows where
the bathroom is?

14
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:39,407
I do.

15
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:41,005
Go with Ian to the bathroom.

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,377
I don't have to go.

17
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:44,785
We're not at school.
Nobody goes anywhere
by themselves.

18
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:45,433
Why?

19
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,763
In case you get lost.

20
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,619
Or in case
somebody kidnaps us.

21
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:51,139
If somebody kidnaps Ian,
they'll kidnap me too.

22
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:52,390
I want to stay
with the class.

23
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,802
Michael, go with Ian--
[Sharp gasp] Aah!

24
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:55,966
Do you need help?

25
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:57,492
I need you
to find a grown-up.

26
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,477
Is the baby coming?

27
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,428
Aah! Aah!

28
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:00,858
Who should I take with me?

29
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:03,095
You're fine.
Go to the front desk, or--

30
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:04,550
Or find a security guard.

31
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,393
I really have to pee.

32
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:09,596
God.

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,734
Is--is the baby coming?

34
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:13,444
I don't know
how to do this.

35
00:01:13,637 --> 00:01:15,370
Are you okay, Ian?

36
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,044
Yeah, sure.

37
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:21,492
I don't think you are.

38
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,862
You're bleeding.

39
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,119
Help!

40
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:31,277
Help!

41
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,647
2X17 - All In

42
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,038
Original Airdate (FOX): 11 APR-2006

43
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:07,686
"Deed I do"

44
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:15,777
# Do I love you?
Oh my do I "

45
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:19,942
# Honey, indeed I do #

46
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:26,246
# Do I want you?
Oh my do I #

47
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,345
# Honey, deed I do #

48
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:30,154
- 20.
- Call.

49
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:32,519
You'll call anything.

50
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,695
My stack is bigger than your stack.

51
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:37,354
You in or out?

52
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:42,590
You know that relative to their size,
gorillas have smaller testicles than humans.

53
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:46,370
Well, then you'd probably
have an edge over a gorilla.
But not over me.

54
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,364
The reason is,
primate teste size inversely corresponds
to the fidelity of our females.

55
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,618
Do you think
there might be a better time
to annoy me about my wife?

56
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:58,253
- I'm talking about poker.
- Right.

57
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,196
Women are evil.
You're right to drive them away.

58
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:02,716
Call, fold, or raise.
Story time can wait.

59
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,069
We're smaller and
better than chimps,

60
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:07,801
bigger and worse than gorillas.

61
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:12,607
For all our rationality, supposed trust
and fealty to a higher power,

62
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:16,571
our ability to create
a system of rules and laws,

63
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,966
our baser drives are
more powerful than any of that.

64
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:23,678
We want to control
our emotions, but we can't.

65
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,623
If we're happy,
things don't annoy us.

66
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:30,337
If, on the other hand, we're
sitting on crappy hole cards,

67
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,889
little tiny things annoy us
a whole lot more.

68
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:39,103
I raise.

69
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,505
So are you going to
tell me an annoying story
every time I raise?

70
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,447
God, that would be annoying.

71
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:45,862
I call.

72
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,659
Dr. Cuddy?
Got one of your patients in the E.R.

73
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:50,216
Ian Alston.
Six years old.

74
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,190
Ah... Oh, I know him.
What's the problem?
I'm all in.

75
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:57,452
Bloody diarrhea, hemodynamically stable,
but he's been developing
some coordination problems.

76
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:59,433
It sounds like gastroenteritis
and dehydration.

77
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:01,684
Order fluids, and
I'll take it on my service.

78
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:02,711
Cuddy:
Bet's to you, House.

79
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,734
They scan his head?

80
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:05,580
- No, why would they scan--
- Don't play games.

81
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,815
- You gonna call?
- How's the heart rate?

82
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:08,795
Stable.

83
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,071
I'm sorry. House?
It's gastroenteritis.

84
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,709
I'm not going anywhere.

85
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:17,640
Put the order in, and
have someone tell Alan and Sarah
that I'll be up when I'm done.

86
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:20,494
You in or out?

87
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:26,006
I'm out.

88
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,436
Stone cold bluff.

89
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:35,521
You might want to
spend a little more time
paying attention to your cards,

90
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:38,244
and a little less time
staring at my breasts.

91
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:39,955
They don't match, either.

92
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:41,799
I'm going to take some air.

93
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,659
Follow my finger with your eyes.

94
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,545
How  much longer
will Dr. Cuddy be?

95
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:14,345
Well, given the number of Mojitos

96
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:19,075
she's knocking back at the party,
I'd say it's gonna be at least three hours
before she's even conscious.

97
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:21,534
Weren't you at the same party?

98
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,222
I don't drink.

99
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,185
I want you to reach out
and grab my cane.

100
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:34,722
What's wrong?

101
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:38,091
Your son's brain is
losing control of his muscles.

102
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,807
Dr. Cuddy's message said it was
just dehydration from the diarrhea.

103
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:43,185
She's  wrong.

104
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:46,478
Is he going to be all right?

105
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,534
I don't know.

106
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,802
So were you in one of those cages?

107
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:23,983
No.

108
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:27,723
No, no, no.
Those are for tourists.

109
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:29,768
You were in the water
with a great white.

110
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:30,506
Sure.

111
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,900
It's no big deal.
You just have to keep an eye on them.

112
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:37,001
If they get too close,
punch 'em in the nose.

113
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:39,052
Send them on their way.

114
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:43,305
- I had you going.
- You are mean.

115
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,616
Hey, how's that anal fissure?

116
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:49,414
Did  it heal yet,
or is it still draining?

117
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:52,380
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you came back for seconds.

118
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:55,488
I figured that
after that girl in the stairwell,
you'd be done for the night.

119
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,556
He's joking.

120
00:06:56,618 --> 00:07:00,571
No Adam's apple, small hands.
It's no surprises this time.

121
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,850
I'll, uh, see you later.

122
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,135
Got a case.

123
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,913
Well, you could've just said that.
You didn't have to screw with me.

124
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,900
Yeah, but if I didn't screw with you,
you'd spend the whole night
thinking you might get laid.

125
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:15,688
Which means you'd be useless.
Better to extinguish all hope.

126
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:18,661
Get Foreman and Cameron
and meet me upstairs, stat.

127
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:25,540
What's so urgent?

128
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:29,178
Two cases, same symptoms.

129
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:32,428
What do 6-year-olds and
70-year-olds have in common?

130
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,859
Their immune systems
don't work as well.
Could be listeria.

131
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,201
I already checked for that.

132
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:38,890
Leukemia has a higher prevalence
in both the young and old.

133
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:39,939
Cameron:
So does asthma.

134
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,382
House:
No, no, no.

135
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,140
They can both get diabetes.

136
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,282
No.

137
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:51,761
The nearly dead and the newly bred
have more in common with each other
than with people in the middle.

138
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,601
It's weird.

139
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:55,685
Some kind of circle of life thing.

140
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,582
This kid doesn't have
kidney failure.

141
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,250
He will.

142
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:01,368
Based on this file,
the kid just ate some bad food.

143
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:02,130
Was the old man--

144
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:05,516
They were nowhere near each other
in any of the four dimensions.

145
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,577
- This case is 12 years old.
- Yep.

146
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:11,936
- And this case is Cuddy's.
- She assigned it to me.

147
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,779
She agrees with you that
this is something more
than gastroenteritis?

148
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:18,452
She wouldn't have assigned it to me
if she did, now would she?

149
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:20,904
Gohhh.

150
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,208
What were we talking about?

151
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:30,509
Two patients with
two symptoms in common.

152
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,241
And five symptoms
not in common.

153
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:36,070
While you were all wearing your
"Frankie says relax" t-shirts,

154
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:38,250
I was treating
a 73-year-old woman

155
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,306
who went through this
progression of symptoms.

156
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,362
The last of which was...

157
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,876
In case any of you missed
that class in med school,
that one's untreatable.

158
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,395
Kid's got the first two.

159
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:54,795
Took Esther
an hour and 20 minutes
to go from two to three.

160
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:57,895
And less than a day to make it
all the way to the rear exit.

161
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:01,860
This is all because a child has
some blood in his diarrhea.

162
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:03,086
He's got a tummy ache.

163
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,470
If there was any reason to think
it was anything worse,
Cuddy would be all over it.

164
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,304
Great.
Do a colonoscopy.

165
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:11,068
On a six-year-old kid who
probably has nothing worse
than some food poisoning?

166
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:14,939
If you happen to
find any purple papules,
do me a favor and grab a slice.

167
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:17,312
I want to check
for Erdheim Chester.

168
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:21,697
A disease that there have been what,
maybe 200 reported cases of? Ever?

169
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:24,336
If Esther's family had
let me do an autopsy,

170
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:26,706
there'd be 201.

171
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,677
Foreman:
See anything?

172
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:42,897
Chase:
No, and I don't expect to.

173
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:46,160
House usually avoids cases.

174
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:49,409
If he's actually
stealing a case from Cuddy,
there's got to be a reason.

175
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:51,881
It's not the first time
I've seen this file.

176
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,893
About a month before
Cameron was hired,

177
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:57,151
some trucker came in here
with these symptoms.

178
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:58,819
House decided he was dying.

179
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:03,267
Two days and a spinal tap,
bone marrow extraction, and
three colonoscopies later,

180
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:08,017
we sent the guy home
with a bunch of pain killers and
a diagnosis of a bad cheese sandwich.

181
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:14,268
One of the guys who
worked here before me said House tried
to cure Esther at least three other times.

182
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:19,085
You know how people see
the Virgin Mary in Danishes and stuff?

183
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,669
Someone died 12 years ago,
and House doesn't know why.

184
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:29,876
House sees that case now
in paint peeling, in clouds,
and now in this poor kid.

185
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:33,426
Erdheim Chester is
an abnormal growth of some
of the cells that fight infection.

186
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:35,788
Is that cancer?
'Cause he seems okay now.

187
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:38,089
Yeah, the other doctor
kind of scared us about that.

188
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:41,076
He shouldn't have.
We're just testing.
It'll probably be negative.

189
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,008
Alan:
I don't understand.

190
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:43,635
You don't think that's what it is,
but you want to--

191
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,097
you want to do
this thing to him anyway?

192
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:46,042
We need to be sure.

193
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,577
Isn't there any other way?

194
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,187
It shouldn't take long.

195
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:51,311
All right.

196
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:54,512
Those ridges look a lot
like purple papules.

197
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:57,525
They're not purple, they're red.
They're probably just blood blisters.

198
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:01,900
Give me the biopsy needle.

199
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,732
How long is this going to take?

200
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:17,920
Forget it, Chase. Your
punching-out-the-shark story's good,
but she's not waiting for you.

201
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:20,204
So?

202
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,056
We couldn't confirm
the source of the bleeding.

203
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,217
- But we did biopsy some--
- Blood blisters.

204
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,648
You mean papules.

205
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,028
Come on, Cameron.
Who's right?

206
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:30,941
Chase is.

207
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:32,632
Negative for Erdheim Chester.

208
00:11:32,716 --> 00:11:33,936
Let me see.

209
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:45,020
- If it's not Erdheim Chester--
- It's exactly what we said before.

210
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,599
Garden variety viral gastroenteritis.
Can we go back to the party?

211
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:50,366
Do a kidney biopsy.

212
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,372
Esther's shut down
in exactly--

213
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:54,766
Chase:
This kid is not Esther.

214
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,524
You screwed up,
she died. I'm sorry.

215
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,750
But that does not mean
this kid is dying as well.

216
00:11:58,768 --> 00:11:59,767
Jeez.

217
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:02,058
You get testy when
you don't get any fuzz.

218
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,219
Come on.

219
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:18,815
What did the test say?

220
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:20,453
Chase:
Colonoscopy was clean.

221
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:22,885
And the biopsy was negative
for Erdheim Chester.

222
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,529
Alan:
So Ian's going to be all right.
It was just some sort of virus.

223
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:28,057
What's that?

224
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:29,993
Urine.

225
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,633
But it's brown.

226
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:34,919
Ian's kidneys
are shutting down.

227
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,661
Still think it's
not the same case?

228
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:58,569
House:
So, what can cause bloody diarrhea,
ataxia, and kidney failure?

229
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,720
- I'll go do a biopsy.
- House: Forget it.

230
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:02,200
That battle's over.

231
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:06,354
His rising creatinine is
his kidneys' way of saying,
"Go on without me."

232
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:09,967
What explains everything?

233
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:16,683
E. Coli HO:157 causes
bloody diarrhea and leads to
hemolytic uremic syndrome.

234
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,272
Toxins from the bacteria
cause his kidneys to shut down.

235
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:20,998
We should start him
on plasmaphoresis.

236
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:24,757
Clear, concise,
and completely plausible.

237
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:27,858
And exactly what I did
last time. Didn't work.

238
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,012
- What else?
- Good Pasture's syndrome.

239
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:32,667
Circulating antibodies cause
kidney failure and bleeding.

240
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:34,219
But not the purple papules.

241
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,074
If you throw in
Esther's next symptom--

242
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:38,417
brain--makes me think
heavy metal toxicity.

243
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:40,589
His hematocrit would
have to be low. It's at 44, and

244
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:43,160
- Esther's never dropped below...
- 42.

245
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,467
You have the file memorized?

246
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,088
It's my lucky number.

247
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,280
What about lymphoma?

248
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:51,244
Causes kidney failure, GI bleed,
and can infiltrate the base of the brain.

249
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:54,738
You check Esther for that?

250
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:57,202
She never showed
any signs of...

251
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:02,487
If he has lymphoma
this far advanced, we should be
able to see it in his blood and brain.

252
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:07,077
Chase, run a blood smear
and immunochemistries.
Foreman, get an MRI.

253
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,229
- I'll page Cuddy.
- No, you won't.

254
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:11,802
She thinks the kid
has a stomach ache.

255
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:13,814
She'll come right up here
and do one of two things.

256
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,381
If she agrees with me,
I don't need her.

257
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:16,799
If she disagrees,
I don't want her.

258
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:18,847
Can't handle people
disagreeing with you?

259
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:20,189
She might have
a different take on this.

260
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,556
Subordinates can disagree
with me all they want. It's healthy.

261
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:26,270
People who can shut me down,
on the other hand...

262
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:29,278
Forget Cuddy.
I'll have Wilson keep her busy.

263
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:32,433
[Phone rings]

264
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:40,660
Keep your answers
short and discreet.
Is Cuddy still playing?

265
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:44,227
The chicken...
is still in Piccadilly Square.

266
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:45,037
Brilliant.

267
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:47,318
She'll never suspect that
Normandy is our target.

268
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:48,667
Is that House?

269
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:52,629
Tell him that the blinds
just went to 20/40, and
he's running out of chips.

270
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,467
House:
How's she doing?

271
00:14:53,618 --> 00:14:54,734
Well, what's going on?

272
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:56,694
The way you took off,
something's obviously--

273
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:58,510
Love to chat.
But got a game to play.

274
00:14:58,594 --> 00:14:59,716
How's  she doing?

275
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,539
The patient is on life support.
We're about to pull the plug.

276
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:03,466
Are you talking about me?

277
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:04,723
What have you got?

278
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:08,064
Mmm... Those sound like
high-dose cardio meds.

279
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:09,366
Two hearts.

280
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:11,315
You got the flush?

281
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:12,492
Still waiting on the final labs.

282
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,326
She drinking her seltzer?

283
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,679
No. Hydration
is not a problem.

284
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,398
House:
Means she's bluffing.
Push her all in.

285
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:24,259
Call.

286
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:25,624
Two pair.

287
00:15:26,002 --> 00:15:27,757
Show me your hearts.

288
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,689
Seven of clubs.

289
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:36,893
Oh, dear.
Sounds like I messed up.

290
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,870
You're gonna be stuck
with her for a while.

291
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:40,602
Talk to you soon.
[Hangs up]

292
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:44,119
Oh... Yes.

293
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:00,468
Why are you taking
a picture of his head?

294
00:16:00,615 --> 00:16:02,084
We're looking
for lymphoma, but--

295
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,861
So it's not
Erdheim something.

296
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:07,553
And it's not his kidneys.
But his kidneys are failing.

297
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:09,101
W hat--
Where's Dr. Cuddy?

298
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:10,841
Dr. House
mentioned another case.

299
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:13,184
Is there another patient with
the same-- same thing that Ian has?

300
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:15,722
- Not...exactly.
- What does that mean?

301
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:20,194
Dr. House had a patient
a while back who exhibited
the same symptoms as your son.

302
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:22,327
Then you know
what's wrong?

303
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:23,574
No.

304
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,986
So what do you know?

305
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,558
We know the likely course
the disease will take.

306
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:28,992
Alan:
Which is?

307
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:32,470
- She had multiple system failures--
- What happened to her?

308
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:40,091
She died 24 hours
after her admission.

309
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:49,702
Mr. or Mrs. Alston,
would you mind giving me a hand?

310
00:16:51,948 --> 00:16:54,047
He's having trouble sitting still.

311
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,484
It's impossible to get
the detail we need.

312
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:59,405
So I figured he might feel more
comfortable hearing your voices.

313
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:06,691
Ian, honey?

314
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:09,488
Just sit still.

315
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:12,646
You'll be done in a moment.
We're here with you.

316
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,413
I'm scared.

317
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:17,422
It's okay, honey. It's...

318
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:21,271
It's only a big camera.
It's going to take
a picture of your head.

319
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,053
You love it when I take your
picture at home, don't you?

320
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:26,161
Yeah.

321
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:30,406
And you have to hold still
for that too, right?

322
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:33,155
But this isn't like that.

323
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:37,172
I know it's scary, Ian.

324
00:17:37,353 --> 00:17:39,057
But you can do it.

325
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,411
You're getting
to be so grown up.

326
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:46,241
So  just...

327
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:49,745
hold perfectly still.
Just for a little bit.

328
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:52,960
Mommy, are you crying?

329
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:57,882
No. No, honey.
I'm just tired.

330
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:01,448
Okay. I'll try.

331
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,881
The base of his brain has been
infiltrated by a small mass.

332
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:34,249
- We think--
- Pituitary?

333
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:35,027
Looks that way.

334
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:36,883
Explains
the low blood pressure.

335
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,877
Pretty much confirms
the lymphoma.

336
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,809
If we'd started Esther
on prednisone...

337
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,410
Uh, did anyone see
the lymphoma?

338
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:54,151
Cameron:
No, we saw a mass.
The location was consistent with--

339
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:55,983
Didn't see any
in the blood, either.

340
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,329
White blood cells show
no spindling or abnormal nuclei.

341
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:02,478
Nothing on
immunochemistries, either.
It's not lymphoma.

342
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,721
Foreman:
House.

343
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,967
It's a train.

344
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,320
We don't know
what kind of train.

345
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:43,845
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm thirsty.

346
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:45,238
It's closed.

347
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,865
It's not now.

348
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:58,990
We got one advantage.

349
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,637
We know where
the tracks are going.

350
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:03,018
The fact that the end
of the line is death...

351
00:20:03,422 --> 00:20:04,521
is an advantage?

352
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:07,132
The fact that we know
is an advantage.

353
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:09,319
Means maybe we can
get ahead of it.

354
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,966
Next station is the liver. We've got...
About 90 minutes before it gets there.

355
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:17,145
Maybe we can cut down a tree
across the line just outside of town.

356
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:18,316
I'll do an ultrasound.

357
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:20,513
No, treatment will
tell us more, faster.

358
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,888
How can we start treatment if we have no idea what we'retreating for?

359
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:24,702
[Dishes clatter]
Treat him for everything.

360
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:28,656
Give him acetylcysteine.
And interferon. And silymarin.

361
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,347
And whatever else you can
think of to protect the liver.

362
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,526
[Phone rings]

363
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:46,399
What's going on?

364
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:49,066
Oh, just catching up
on some TV.

365
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:50,002
How are you doing?

366
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,808
Well, thanks to
your last consult,

367
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:53,552
the patient has
improved dramatically.

368
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:55,923
Tell House the patient is
about to kill the doctor.

369
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,649
- She says the pa--
- I heard. What d'ya got?

370
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:00,471
Well, Cuddy just
raised, and, uh...

371
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:01,837
- You're paired.
- What?

372
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:02,767
Nines?

373
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:06,486
How do you know?

374
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,371
Anything lower,
you wouldn't sound so excited.

375
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:10,783
Jacks or higher,

376
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:14,342
your voice sounds like
Debbie from accounting
is sitting in your lap.

377
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:16,487
Ask Cuddy if she can
beat a pair of threes.

378
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:18,052
Wait, what's--What's going on?

379
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:20,094
If you're going to mess with me,
wouldn't it be more fun to do it in person?

380
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,628
Yes, it would.

381
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:25,630
Um, can you beat
a pair of threes?

382
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,874
House:
What did she do?

383
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,158
I left orders
for PO fluids, doctor.

384
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:31,490
Enough with the codes.
She obviously knows it's me.

385
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:33,189
She's drinking her seltzer.

386
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,543
Did she stop?

387
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,224
- Yes.
- Go all in.

388
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,697
- Um...but...
- Just do it.

389
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,464
You couldn't care less
about this charity event.

390
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,371
You claim not to be
messing with me.

391
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:46,259
Obviously, you're either
trying to keep me--

392
00:21:46,343 --> 00:21:47,248
Shut up.

393
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:49,909
Look, last time,
I wanted the game to go on.

394
00:21:49,993 --> 00:21:50,987
I still do.

395
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,063
That means that this time,
you get to win.

396
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:54,176
Hold on.

397
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:02,678
I fold.

398
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:06,727
Ho, ho, ho.

399
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,528
House,
are you sure you're okay?

400
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:48,235
Meds seem to be working.
Liver's holding its own.

401
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:49,835
Good.

402
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,290
But the platelets are dropping.

403
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:52,377
Even better.

404
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:53,945
Why? It means
he's getting sicker.

405
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:56,603
It's new.
New is good.

406
00:22:57,402 --> 00:22:59,984
Because old ended in death.

407
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,377
I can't breathe.

408
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:06,127
Chase!

409
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:07,324
What?

410
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,163
What's happening?

411
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:16,469
Ian. Come on.

412
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,582
Honey, just relax.

413
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:21,594
Ian, breathe.
Come on, honey.

414
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:24,313
Breathe,
please, honey.

415
00:23:49,232 --> 00:23:51,370
[Crash!]

416
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,598
We had to put him
on a ventilator.

417
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,851
He's back
on Esther's path.

418
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:23,297
And we managed to
make the train skip a few stations.

419
00:24:23,381 --> 00:24:27,371
Which means
that instead of 12 hours,
he's probably got less than two.

420
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:29,218
Which begs the question, why?

421
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:30,344
What did we do?

422
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,031
Acetylcysteine could
mess with the lungs.

423
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,790
Mess with them.
Not shut them down
in 20 minutes.

424
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,985
Interferon modulates
the immune system.

425
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:39,993
It could affect
cancer of the blood,
like one of the leukemias.

426
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:41,839
It doesn't speed them up,
it slows them down.

427
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:43,743
It slows down
all 500 of them?

428
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:47,318
Anybody know
where we can find
an oncologist at this hour?

429
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,618
What effects would
interferon have on leukemia?

430
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,152
Depends on what type.
Could make it better,
could make it worse.

431
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,134
Four-year fellowship
to learn that.

432
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:04,770
Cuddy:
Tell House if he wants to play cards,
he should get his ass
back down here and play.

433
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,644
You hear that?

434
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:07,967
She wants me off the phone.
Means she's vulnerable.

435
00:25:08,051 --> 00:25:08,684
Go all in.

436
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:13,042
But, um, the party's over
in less than three hours.

437
00:25:13,126 --> 00:25:15,049
Cuddy:
It's over in less than two hours.

438
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:20,923
Which means you either have
three of a kind, or just 3s.

439
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,236
I'm guessing 3s.

440
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:26,714
I bet 500.

441
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:28,938
Go all in.

442
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:31,591
You obviously want to bust me.
Why would you--

443
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:32,846
Either you go all in, or

444
00:25:32,954 --> 00:25:35,868
I tell everybody in the building
that you wear toenail polish.

445
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:39,173
I'm all in.

446
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,671
I'll call.

447
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,595
I'm betting you have a pair of threes,
but even if you have three...

448
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:52,485
it's not going to beat trip nines.

449
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:56,478
Oh. Oh, oh no.

450
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:57,392
Oh, no.

451
00:25:57,476 --> 00:26:00,141
Oh, oh.
That's gotta hurt.

452
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:00,867
What happened?

453
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:02,948
I just killed two birds
with one straight.

454
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,985
Good-bye.

455
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:06,617
Fine. Keep playing.

456
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:08,229
But I need you to
recommend a good oncologist.

457
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:11,898
Because if I don't get one
up here in the next few minutes,
I got a dead six-year-old.

458
00:26:14,652 --> 00:26:16,118
Wilson:
If you need help, ask.

459
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:18,198
These games are insane.

460
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:20,560
Games have
a higher success rate.

461
00:26:20,627 --> 00:26:22,881
Well, I don't see anything
that looks like leukemia.

462
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,532
You do a bone marrow biopsy?

463
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,481
No time.

464
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:27,487
Even if there is
an occult blood cancer,

465
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,937
you wouldn't expect
interferon to make it worse.

466
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:31,453
Certainly not this fast.

467
00:26:31,537 --> 00:26:33,310
What would move this fast?

468
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:34,456
Cameron:
Autoimmune diseases.

469
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,247
If his body's own defenses are
attacking him, then beefing them up
is just going to put fuel on the fire.

470
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:40,358
Sarcoidosis could be
in his brain and lungs.

471
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:43,085
No, no enlarged hilar lymph nodes
on his chest x-ray.

472
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,193
The systemic nature suggests
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis.

473
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:47,583
Or Kawasaki's disease.

474
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:48,845
Can't be Kawasaki's.

475
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:50,721
Doesn't affect the elderly.

476
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:53,976
Uh, these...
This is a kid's x-ray.

477
00:26:54,078 --> 00:26:56,068
House had another patient...

478
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,758
Who may or may not
have had Kawasaki's.

479
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:01,210
This kid,
on the other hand...

480
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:04,874
He makes antibodies that are
eating the inside of his arteries.

481
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,872
Choking off blood to
his major organs one by one.

482
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:11,948
First the GI tract, then the kidneys,
then the brain, now the lungs.

483
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:17,341
Can anyone think of a reason why
Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly?

484
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,601
Other than that it doesn't?

485
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,313
Nice.

486
00:27:23,397 --> 00:27:24,960
Foreman:
We can confirm with blood work.

487
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,682
We need an ANA, sed rate--

488
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:28,320
Labs will take two hours.

489
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:30,365
What was the old lady's sed rate?

490
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:32,103
House:
Elevated. 98.

491
00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:35,955
You can't use another patient's labs
to diagnose Kawasaki's disease.

492
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,334
Is that like a dare
or something?

493
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:38,947
You don't have time
to be wrong.

494
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,735
Fine.

495
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:41,942
We'll look for Kawasaki
where he lives.

496
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:44,333
Ian's coronary arteries.

497
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:52,165
This other patient.

498
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:57,558
The old lady. Esther?

499
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,533
Have you read Moby Dick?

500
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:03,778
It was a book?

501
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,495
It was 10 years ago.
12.

502
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:08,162
Obsessionis dangerous.

503
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:11,062
Only if you're on a wooden ship
and your obsession is a whale.

504
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:12,444
I think I'm in the clear.

505
00:28:12,528 --> 00:28:14,116
You do realize
it's a metaphor?

506
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,074
You do realize that
the point of metaphors is to scare people
from doing things by telling them that

507
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:21,222
something much scarier
is going to happen than
what will really happen.

508
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,950
God, I wish I had a metaphor
to explain that better.

509
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:26,652
Go back to the game.

510
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,008
Don't worry.
I'm not going to
get eaten by witches.

511
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:37,050
Chase:
Coronary arteries clear.
No aneurysms.

512
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:39,185
Flip the mode.
Let's see the flow.

513
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:45,230
How did that other woman die?

514
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:49,152
She went into
respiratory distress.

515
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,979
Her heart and liver
were already com--

516
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,940
No.

517
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:55,506
Did she suffer?

518
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,928
Was she in pain?

519
00:28:58,351 --> 00:28:59,891
I don't know.

520
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:04,349
Laminar flow.

521
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:07,087
No blood clots,
no ragged edges.

522
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:08,984
Cameron:
Damn. Shut it down.

523
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:10,747
We're just wasting time.

524
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:17,954
Look at the right atrium.

525
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:19,522
That's not Kawasaki's.

526
00:29:19,606 --> 00:29:20,544
No.

527
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:23,002
Chase:
It's small. But it's there.

528
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:25,325
Esther didn't have
a mass in her heart.

529
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:26,774
Ian's younger.

530
00:29:26,858 --> 00:29:27,960
He can take
more of a pounding.

531
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:30,108
Esther died before
the disease reached her heart.

532
00:29:30,177 --> 00:29:32,056
The disease made a mass
and made it fast.

533
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,266
Could be bacteria.

534
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,950
- Muscle.
- Connective tissue.

535
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,949
Hosue:
The kid can't take
any more theories.

536
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:40,108
Only thing we know is
that whatever that mass is,
that's what he's got.

537
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:42,191
We need a piece of it.

538
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:44,219
I'm doing a biopsy.

539
00:29:58,655 --> 00:29:59,891
I'll shut the blinds.

540
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,411
No, let them watch.

541
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:04,402
I do my best work
on the big stage.

542
00:30:05,557 --> 00:30:08,225
Passing through
the superior vena cava.

543
00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:10,949
You're in the atrium.
Pull back.

544
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:14,158
You hit the wall of the heart.

545
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:18,999
These procedures would be so much simpler
if we could do them on healthy people.

546
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:22,667
And out again.

547
00:30:23,225 --> 00:30:24,486
[Monitors start beeping]

548
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:27,085
- V. Fib.
- Cardiac arrest. Call it.

549
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,155
Come on. Paddles.

550
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,899
- Come on.
- Charging.

551
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:34,853
Clear.

552
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:40,601
[Overhead speaker]
"Code blue. ISO room."

553
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:43,626
And again.

554
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:49,005
- Nothing.
- Again.

555
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,468
Have you got
a clock on this?

556
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:07,392
How much longer
you going to be doing this?

557
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,010
Clear.

558
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:15,367
Wait. Got something.

559
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:19,531
He's back.

560
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:28,139
Chase:
What are you doing?

561
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:29,853
I'm doing what
we came here to do.

562
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:32,407
- It almost killed him.
- I know. I was right here.

563
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:33,589
Give me a vacutainer.

564
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:37,020
His brain's been oxygen-deprived
for over eight minutes.

565
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,385
There might benothing left.
You might be--

566
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:41,246
Tell the parents.
Where the hell is that vacutainer?

567
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:54,543
So. What's he got?

568
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:55,747
Brain damage.

569
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,082
Good chance.
I was talking about before that.

570
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,189
You're not worried about--

571
00:31:59,189 --> 00:32:01,865
Things I can't do anything about?
I try not to.

572
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:04,941
Things just roll off you
like water off a duck.

573
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,219
Histiocytosis.

574
00:32:06,303 --> 00:32:08,359
Very unlikely
in a 73-year-old.

575
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:10,724
Whatever this is,
is very unlikely.

576
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:13,193
Come on, more ideas.
Let's go, people.

577
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:15,543
Genetic disorders could
cause masses everywhere.

578
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:16,710
Tuberous sclerosis.

579
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:19,080
If it's genetic,
he's had it all his life.
Why now?

580
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:21,492
I don't know.
It sure fits nice enough.

581
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:23,372
We haven't ruled out leukemia yet.

582
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:26,393
Or sarcoma. He could have
multiple soft tissue tumors.

583
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,695
Foreman:
Or sarcoidosis.

584
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,860
- Multiple neurofibromatosis.
Foreman: Chondrocytomas.

585
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:34,566
How's it going?
You win?

586
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:37,947
I got called away
by the angry parents of a patient.

587
00:32:37,947 --> 00:32:41,009
There are three of you here.
None of you had the sense to stop him.

588
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:43,351
- To pick up a phoneand call me.
- House: I told them you'd signed off.

589
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:45,988
The parents are mad
because their kid is dying.

590
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:47,227
It's understandable.

591
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:49,427
But if he doesn't die,
they won't be mad anymore.

592
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,772
If he's brain-damaged,
they might still be a little ticked.

593
00:32:51,856 --> 00:32:55,077
- I had to do it to save him.
- You had to do it to diagnose Esther.

594
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:57,563
You may have killed
a six-year-old

595
00:32:57,626 --> 00:33:00,963
because you're obsessed with
a woman who's been dead for 12 years.

596
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:03,228
Sometimes you lose, House.
You're not God.

597
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:04,303
He's not dead yet.

598
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:06,939
No, but you're done with him.
It's my case now. Go home.

599
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:09,670
Go ride your motorcycle.
Go brood in a dark room.

600
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,663
Just don't go near Ian again.

601
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:22,215
So, anything else?
Or is it just these seven?

602
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:23,560
Drop it, House. She's right.

603
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,892
No, she's not.

604
00:33:26,147 --> 00:33:28,397
- You know she's not.
- We should have called her.

605
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:29,779
I'm surprised you didn't.

606
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:33,262
You're going to have to find a way
to let this go--we can't go near Ian.

607
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,837
We don't need to go near him.

608
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:37,043
We have his tumor.

609
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:40,214
Cuddy may be right that
we screwed up the protocol.

610
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:42,529
She may be right about
my screwed-up obsession.

611
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,998
But I am right
about the medicine.

612
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:47,316
How many tests
can we do with that?

613
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,043
[Sighs]

614
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,755
Look, we cure the kid,
we solve everybody's problems.

615
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,059
How many?

616
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:58,141
- Maybe two good pieces.
- How many okay pieces?

617
00:33:59,012 --> 00:34:00,625
Three would be pushing it.

618
00:34:02,762 --> 00:34:05,679
Three tests, seven choices.

619
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:07,985
Okay, what's first?

620
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,882
Uh...sarcoidosis
seems most likely.

621
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:14,317
Yeah, so likely that
Cuddy's going to think of
that all on her own.

622
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:16,571
She's got the kid's
whole body to play with.

623
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,944
Let her do that test.
What's next?

624
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:21,319
It's moving too fast
to be spreading.

625
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,210
It has to be growing from
something that's already--

626
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,097
Genetic disorder--
Tuberous sclerosis.

627
00:34:25,283 --> 00:34:28,234
Or it's his immune system.
Histiocytosis.

628
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:33,322
There are more documented cases
of histio amongst older people
than tuberous sclerosis.

629
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,552
Let's start with that.

630
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:42,908
Wing or drumstick?

631
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,425
Gonna need a little
more than that.

632
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:48,013
A little more is
more than a third.

633
00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:51,454
If we have to repeat this test
because you didn't cut us enough...

634
00:34:57,675 --> 00:35:00,453
Chase:
I'm adding one microliter
of the immunoperoxidase.

635
00:35:00,537 --> 00:35:01,335
Make it two.

636
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:05,100
I don't want House biting off our heads
because we weren't sure if it turned red or not.

637
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,765
Cameron:
That's definitely not red.

638
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:22,460
The problem could still be
an abnormal cell growth,
but a different cell line.

639
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:25,008
Foreman:
Sarcoma? Muscle cells are
throughout his body.

640
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,206
Would explain the geography.

641
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,334
Cameron:
Genetic disorder is
far more likely in a six-year-old.

642
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:29,502
Tuberous sclerosis.

643
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,548
Pretty unlikely
to cause a GI bleed.

644
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:32,997
The time course fits.

645
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:35,689
So, Foreman,
you agree with both of them.
Thanks for playing.

646
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:38,271
If we have enough tissue
for two tests, why not do both?

647
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:39,684
Then we don't have to
think as hard.

648
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:42,893
Taking the pressure off the choice
makes us less likely to think critically.

649
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:45,830
Sarcoma is more likely to hita 6- and a 70-year-old.

650
00:35:45,914 --> 00:35:47,334
Tuberous sclerosis it is.

651
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:49,283
You think
sarcoma is less likely?

652
00:35:49,283 --> 00:35:50,275
It's more likely.

653
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,422
The test for it,
on the other hand, is less reliable.

654
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:06,924
Cameron:
Nestin's negative.

655
00:36:06,987 --> 00:36:08,031
Well, that's okay.

656
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:12,407
If the tumor cells haven't matured,
the Ki-67 protein wouldn't have turned off.

657
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:16,055
What happens
if we don't solve this?

658
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:18,998
- The kid dies.
- I mean for the next 12 years.

659
00:36:20,788 --> 00:36:22,971
Ki-67's negative.

660
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:29,140
And PCH antigen is negative.

661
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:42,613
Mighty Casey's
down to his last strike.

662
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:44,458
Mighty Casey struck out.

663
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,332
Thanks a lot. I was going to
read that this weekend.

664
00:36:47,432 --> 00:36:48,439
Cameron:
Chondrocytoma.

665
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,974
Connective tissue has been
in all the places we've been looking.

666
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:53,613
The kid is too sick for that.
We're better off testing for sarcoma.

667
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:56,343
We would have seen signs of that
when we tested for tuberous sclerosis.

668
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:58,724
Tumor cells look like muscle
under the microscope.

669
00:36:58,808 --> 00:37:00,779
No, they didn't.
They looked like fat.

670
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:04,895
I vote for
neurofibromatosis.

671
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,444
Why?

672
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:08,751
Because the other choices
suck worse.

673
00:37:17,247 --> 00:37:18,310
Give me a minute.

674
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,393
You want me out of here?

675
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,272
You come up with anything?

676
00:37:56,978 --> 00:37:58,134
No.

677
00:38:24,912 --> 00:38:25,829
Hey.

678
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:28,017
We can talk about it tomorrow.

679
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:37,091
I, um...

680
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:41,286
I won the poker tournament.

681
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,454
I totally played this guy Berman
from business affairs.

682
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,722
I got great cards.
But I don't bet. Just call, no raises.

683
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:52,076
Berman pairs his King on the flop.

684
00:38:52,183 --> 00:38:56,282
I keep calling,
the river turns, I check.

685
00:38:56,387 --> 00:39:00,887
He can't stand it. He goes all in.
He's sure he's won.

686
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,179
I call, I flip 'em. Pow!

687
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:07,536
Pocket aces.

688
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,316
I nailed his ass.

689
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:21,870
The aces were hiding all along.

690
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:32,007
Test him for
Erdheim Chester disease.

691
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:34,389
Erdheim Chester?
That's not even on the list.

692
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,111
Because we already did it.

693
00:39:36,195 --> 00:39:37,292
He tested negative.

694
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,190
So did Esther.

695
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:39,490
The disease lied.

696
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,704
Yeah,
the tumor's got it in for you.
Diseases don't lie.

697
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:45,113
Fine, it didn't lie.
It slow played us.

698
00:39:45,197 --> 00:39:48,709
We biopsied the colon, but
it hadn't reached the GI tract yet.

699
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,185
It's there now.

700
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:51,762
It's in his liver, his lungs...

701
00:39:51,846 --> 00:39:53,582
You want it to be there.

702
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,962
Because then you didn't
screw up 12 years ago.

703
00:39:56,046 --> 00:40:00,191
We can't waste our one test
on the one disease we know it's not.

704
00:40:02,877 --> 00:40:04,443
Run the test.

705
00:40:15,895 --> 00:40:17,203
You sure about this?

706
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,136
Wait, let me think about that.

707
00:40:19,282 --> 00:40:20,426
Don't pressure me.

708
00:40:20,573 --> 00:40:22,606
Just run the damn test.

709
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,387
Cameron:
Cells look like macrophages.

710
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:28,887
That's a good start.

711
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:38,242
Take your time
and say it loud.

712
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:49,389
CD 68 positive.

713
00:41:01,608 --> 00:41:03,603
Start the treatment.

714
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:05,372
So Esther can
rest peaceful now, huh?

715
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:07,046
Yeah.

716
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:14,917
40.

717
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:21,929
You got lucky.

718
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,166
You gonna call?

719
00:42:24,354 --> 00:42:26,227
What I do...

720
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,452
is not just based
on the flip of a card.

721
00:42:29,704 --> 00:42:32,380
You guessed.
You got lucky.

722
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:33,412
It fit.

723
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,491
It could just as easily have been
sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.

724
00:42:36,575 --> 00:42:38,963
No, not just as easily.

725
00:42:39,047 --> 00:42:41,827
Maybe not.
But it wasn't impossible.

726
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:46,506
Are you going to call?

727
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,301
You know,

728
00:42:49,637 --> 00:42:51,323
relative to its size,

729
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:54,956
the barnacle has
the largest penis of any animal.
