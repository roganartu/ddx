1
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,392
I still can't believe
you talked me into this.

2
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:29,783
Come on, honey.
You're gonna throw him off.

3
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:31,785
It's okay. I'm almost done.

4
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:36,165
A little more light on your hips.

5
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:37,791
Oh, god.

6
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:40,752
Why couldn't you have come up
with this before I had two kids?

7
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,588
You look amazing.

8
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:46,841
Okay, I think...

9
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:48,510
Yeah, I'm done.

10
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:50,303
Wanna come take a look?

11
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:58,359
I can't.

12
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:00,810
You first.

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,550
No, we'll look together.

14
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:12,240
I don't understand. I thought...

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,807
- What the hell is that?
- Honey. It's okay.

16
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,966
This is not what we discussed,
or what I paid for.

17
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:19,541
I don't understand. I think
this is one of the best I've ever done.

18
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,822
I want my money back.

19
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:23,253
I'm sorry, but this is not some
department store photo studio.

20
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:26,386
- And this is not my wife.
- Yes, it is.

21
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:29,263
You asked me to paint her
exactly as she looks.

22
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:30,802
That's exactly what I did.

23
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:33,467
Honey! Oh, stop it!

24
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:35,374
What's going on? Brandon!

25
00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:38,693
That check...
better be in my mailbox by friday.

26
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:40,061
Or I'll be back.

27
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:42,439
Come on!

28
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,518
- What happened?
- I don't know.

29
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:48,496
They saw the painting
and they just freaked out.

30
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:53,533
Brandon, what is this?

31
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:55,710
What do you mean?
It's her portrait.

32
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,123
What's wrong with it?

33
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:07,797
House - Season 05 Episode 03
"Adverse Events"

34
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:14,737
Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak

35
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:33,198
www.house-fr.com

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,218
Why's this in here?

37
00:02:41,338 --> 00:02:42,999
First column, last entry.

38
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:47,251
Today is going to be a good day.

39
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:53,124
This him?

40
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:54,618
- Yes.
- No.

41
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,818
She means are you
the private investigator

42
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:00,669
whose bills I've tried to slip
through as medical expenses?

43
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:03,222
Hi. I'm Lucas Douglas, p. i.

44
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:06,248
This hospital's not putting
a private investigator on retainer.

45
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,776
Nor is it gonna pay any more
phony repairs on vending machines,

46
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,402
cryostats, or elevators.

47
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:14,206
Information saves lives.
Saving lives saves money.

48
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:16,635
No, saving lives costs money,

49
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:19,494
which is why i'm trying to make sure
there's still some left!

50
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:21,392
You want your own personal p. i.,

51
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:23,248
you're gonna have to pay
for him yourself.

52
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:26,042
- Sorry.
- No, I understand.

53
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:28,253
Hey, I like the shoes, by the way.

54
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:32,915
Thank... you.

55
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,137
You don't like her shoes.
You like her legs.

56
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,598
It sounds less creepy
if you say shoes.

57
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:42,559
Less creepy, more gay.

58
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,143
That's my firm's motto.

59
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,397
- What is a cryostat?
- No idea.

60
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,417
Whoever fixed ours
is about to get stiffed.

61
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,000
There's no distorted perspective
in any of his other recent works.

62
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,543
Not much talent, either.

63
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:10,586
So the symptoms just came on.

64
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:13,437
Acute onset visual agnosia points
to a stroke or brain tumor.

65
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:15,451
M.R.I. revealed no stroke
or brain tumor.

66
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,099
We should do another with contrast.

67
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:19,778
If he's like the struggling artists
I've known, he's also into drugs.

68
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:21,723
We should...
What are you looking at?

69
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,930
Apparently a moron.

70
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,144
One, E.R. routinely tests for drugs.

71
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,521
If it was positive,
we wouldn't be looking at this file.

72
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:32,400
Two, who pays 12% interest
on a car loan?

73
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:35,153
How did you...
Did you run a credit check on me?

74
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:36,738
No... that would be illegal.

75
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:40,158
Interestingly enough, paying someone
to run it for me, though...

76
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:44,829
What?

77
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,235
- It's part of my job.
- Your job is to diagnose patients.

78
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,379
Which I do with the team.
How am I supposed to know

79
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,707
how best to utilize that team
if I don't know everything about them?

80
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:56,299
Say the Van Gogh
turns out to have neurosyphilis,

81
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:59,020
and our last vial of penicillin
is in a storeroom

82
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,388
at the end of a 20-mile hallway
with a two-foot high ceiling.

83
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:04,515
You've discovered that
one of us has been hiding

84
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:06,601
the ability to stretch
or shrink themselves?

85
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:07,834
No.

86
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:10,063
I would never out
someone's super powers.

87
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,941
This, on the other hand...

88
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,598
You crawled 20 miles?

89
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:19,459
My name's in the guinness book.

90
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,515
I'll bet that really
impresses the babes.

91
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:23,187
I didn't do it to get the babes.

92
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:26,039
No, that would cheapen
the purity of your achievement.

93
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,979
Sorry to interrupt, but we have
a patient with a probable brain tumor.

94
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,722
Who needs an M.R.I.
With contrast, we've established that.

95
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:33,237
What do you got on Taub?

96
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,630
I got nothing on Taub.

97
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:39,115
Could be environmental. We should check
his studio for toxins, mold, fungus.

98
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:41,511
- Taub's wife, on the other hand...
- House.

99
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:43,842
That's enough.

100
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:47,465
Dad's right.
This is no time for gossip.

101
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,055
A patient
desperately needs our help.

102
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,605
Check his head and his house.

103
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:54,649
- Can't lucas...
- Nope.

104
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:56,359
He's very busy.

105
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,253
If there is a tumor,
this test will show us.

106
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:01,659
Is that stuff dangerous?

107
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,616
This is just the contrast material.

108
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:07,152
There is a small risk
of an anaphylactic reaction.

109
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,397
- I could stop breathing?
- Don't worry.

110
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,379
We're prepared to deal
with whatever happens.

111
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,993
You know, I did some drawings
this morning, and they seemed fine.

112
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:17,021
Maybe it was a reaction
to something I ate.

113
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:20,162
How many people have reactions like that
to something they ate for breakfast?

114
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:22,690
- But if I'm getting better...
- You will continue to get better.

115
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,963
If you're not, we need to know why not
so we can start treatment immediately.

116
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,182
Baby, let them do the test.

117
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:44,257
Can lead poisoning
cause visual agnosia?

118
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:46,593
Not without lead showing up
in the blood work.

119
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:49,805
Nothing in the medicine cabinet
except some harmless toiletries.

120
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:52,861
No signs of mold
or fungus anywhere, either.

121
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,267
You think House
really got something on your wife?

122
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,239
No. Not that i'd care if he did.

123
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,842
Wait, your wife's doing the doorman
in your bed,

124
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,453
and they're sweating all over
the sheets that you paid for...

125
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:05,634
- My wife's not doing the doorman.
- How do you know?

126
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:07,460
We don't have a doorman.

127
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,842
And I just do, okay?

128
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,142
Drop it.

129
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:15,116
In college, my friends and I came up
with an inverse-square law.

130
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:16,671
Sounds like a real fun group.

131
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,034
The girls who you think are the most
inhibited... Straight arrows...

132
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:23,193
- They're the ones you hook up with.
- Are you saying my wife's a slut?

133
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:25,956
I'm saying if my wife was a slut,
I'd wanna know.

134
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,218
His place was clean.

135
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:32,497
So is his head.

136
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:35,833
Even with contrast,
no masses, no lesions.

137
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:39,295
A neurological symptom with
no apparent neurological cause.

138
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:41,825
Time course means
we can rule out cancer and M.S.

139
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,424
Just leaves toxins or drugs.

140
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:46,552
You called thirteen a moron
for thinking it was drugs.

141
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:48,844
Yeah, but when she said it,
she had other options.

142
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:51,848
And I really just wanted to segue
into her stupid loan and your...

143
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:53,839
A cavernous angioma
in the brain could leak.

144
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,670
Once the blood gets reabsorbed, the
pressure goes down, symptom goes away.

145
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,274
He'll never consent
to petrosal vein sampling.

146
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:01,929
Really?

147
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:04,601
He was nervous about
an injection of contrast.

148
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:07,240
Is his girlfriend hot?

149
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:11,614
And I'm not talking fever here.
I mean, is she all curvy and perky?

150
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:14,246
Very... And if he dies,
it's good news for all of us, but...

151
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,539
That explains why
all his paintings suck.

152
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,806
And what's wrong with him.

153
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:20,081
Where are you going?

154
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:22,009
Tell him he may have
a massive brain tumor.

155
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:23,765
- But he doesn't.
- I know.

156
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:25,963
I'm not a moron. It's drugs.

157
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:32,515
You seem to have
a massive brain tumor.

158
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:35,199
- Who are you?
- He's Dr. House.

159
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:36,649
He's pleased to meet you.

160
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,525
We found no trace
on any of your imaging,

161
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,502
so we need to cut your head open.

162
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,859
It's risky, but it's the only way
to save your life.

163
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:44,839
No.

164
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:46,450
Wrong answer.

165
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,577
- I'm not allowed to say no?
- You're not allowed

166
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,281
to not be terrified.

167
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:53,290
There's only two good reasons
not to be terrified in a hospital.

168
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,712
You're delusional.

169
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:57,539
But then you're not afraid
of contrast material either.

170
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:58,937
Or you know you're fine.

171
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:00,721
Since
we haven't told you you're fine,

172
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,296
you obviously have information
we don't have.

173
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,730
- What drugs are you on?
- His drug tests were clean.

174
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,193
Drug tests only test for drugs
they've made tests for.

175
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:09,880
What are you talking about?

176
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:13,848
Hottie thinks that
he's a great artist,

177
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:16,038
selling art to the rich
and tasteful.

178
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:18,553
She's stupid enough
to be fooled by the canvases,

179
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:20,771
but bank accounts don't lie.
He needed money.

180
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:23,332
There's not many jobs
you can do that don't require time,

181
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:24,901
training, and intelligence.

182
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:27,153
I know you're not a news anchor
or a supermodel,

183
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:29,155
'cause those jobs seldom
cause agnosia.

184
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:30,948
He's a guinea pig.

185
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,659
Companies pay him to test
their untested drugs.

186
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:42,254
Did Hottie go for a pee or coffee?

187
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,378
Either way, I don't think
you should waste any time on denials.

188
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:50,505
The clinical trials
were supposed to be safe.

189
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:52,893
The drugs are about
to be approved by the FDA.

190
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:53,876
Drugs?

191
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:55,822
How many trials are you on?

192
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:58,007
Three.

193
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:00,881
Admirable.

194
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:03,356
Not many idiots
have that much ambition.

195
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:05,839
You've been symptom-free
since your admission,

196
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:08,210
so whatever you took has probably
cleared your system now.

197
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,316
You'll be fine.

198
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,140
Keep him overnight, to make sure,

199
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,550
and get the names
of all the trials he's been in.

200
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,608
You gonna tell Heather?

201
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:18,162
Couldn't, even
if I cared enough to want to.

202
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:34,107
Not bad.

203
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:35,805
You almost made it the whole day.

204
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,301
What'd you find out?

205
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,356
The point is to see
how everyone reacts.

206
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,205
I'm gonna go
get the rest of the gang.

207
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:43,115
Cut the crap, House.

208
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:49,365
Your wife has a separate
bank account in her name only.

209
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:52,266
She's been making weekly cash
deposits for about a year now.

210
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,757
No withdrawals... yet.

211
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:57,227
That's it?

212
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,786
A bank account?

213
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,329
A secret bank account.

214
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,644
What makes you think it's a secret?

215
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:04,637
Because if it wasn't, you'd call it

216
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,734
"the" bank account.

217
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:07,692
Damn.

218
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,465
Always forget to use
the right article when lying.

219
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,842
It's not secret.
We're refurnishing.

220
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:15,678
We set the budget, set up an account.
I couldn't make it to the bank

221
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:16,946
the day we opened it.

222
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:20,308
You're spending almost
$100,000 on furniture?

223
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:23,061
Yes.

224
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,721
- What happened?
- I don't know.

225
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:30,121
He was fine, then all of a sudden,
he started seizing.

226
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,840
He said you told him he was better.

227
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,014
What's happening?
What's wrong with him?

228
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,173
She is hot.

229
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,729
Obviously
the drugs weren't out of his system.

230
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,160
None of these drugs,
nor the drugs that they're derived from,

231
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,427
- are known for causing seizures.
- By themselves, no.

232
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:53,196
But three unproven, untested drugs?
This is like the mod squad.

233
00:11:53,316 --> 00:11:54,595
No one could stop them.

234
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,678
Ridiculous that they let people take
potentially dangerous drugs for money.

235
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:59,465
Just to short circuit that discussion,

236
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,959
people should not be testing drugs
because they're desperate.

237
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,935
But people won't test drugs
unless they're desperate.

238
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:07,007
We need drugs
to save children and puppies.

239
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,607
Ergo, we need desperate people.
Ergo, welfare kills sick children.

240
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:15,446
- First drug...
- Why don't we call it bisexidrine?

241
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:18,705
Clinical trials involve
experimental drugs.

242
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,985
Means they don't have comforting,
catchy names yet.

243
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:23,255
Just random,
unmemorable trial numbers.

244
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:24,460
Go ahead.

245
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,117
Bisexidrine is designed
as an anticoagulant.

246
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:30,195
Phase one indicated some risk
of nausea, E.D., and insomnia.

247
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:32,338
- Second drug.
- Cuckoldisol.

248
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:36,189
- She is having an affair?
- Worse.

249
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:38,776
Sex can be dismissed
as hormonal or emotional.

250
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:41,726
Can be easily regretted.
Money is always a calculated decision.

251
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:45,042
My wife has her own bank account
that House doesn't think I know about.

252
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:46,771
Shocking. Discuss.

253
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,597
Drug b is an autoimmune treatment.
Almost no side effects.

254
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,695
Even if it's doing what
it's supposed to be doing,

255
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:54,270
it doesn't mix well with
anticoagulants or anticonvulsives.

256
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,598
- Which is the third drug?
- World's-sorest-knees-isil.

257
00:12:58,259 --> 00:12:59,667
Cuddy used to have that title.

258
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:01,793
There's a million ways
these drugs could interact

259
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:04,954
if they're doing what they're
supposed to. If they're not two million.

260
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:07,790
It'd be interesting to know which
interactions was causing the problem.

261
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,634
Unfortunately, we don't have to.
We just have to stop the interacting.

262
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:12,554
- If we don't know which...
- Stop them all.

263
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,484
Put him on dialysis.
Clear out his system.

264
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:17,330
Rapid detox risks arrhythmia,
another seizure, hepatic failure.

265
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,636
Difference is, we know what
those risks are. Put him on dialysis.

266
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,688
Dialysis.
Use that for kidney failure, right?

267
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:27,476
Don't worry. Your kidneys are fine.

268
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:29,214
He's not worried about his kidneys.

269
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:32,481
He's worried about how he's going to
explain the dialysis to his girlfriend.

270
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,150
I just don't want her to worry.

271
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,113
You mean
you don't want her to leave you?

272
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,279
What's wrong with that? I love her.

273
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:41,101
It's not like I've lied to her
about anything important.

274
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,347
I'm an artist.

275
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,786
I've sold plenty
of paintings in the past. It's just...

276
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:47,097
I've hit a bit of a dry
spell lately, is all.

277
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,788
So tell her that.

278
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:49,915
He can't.

279
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,302
He wants her to be happy too.

280
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:54,993
He's telling her
what she wants to hear.

281
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:00,935
You didn't know?

282
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:02,688
No.

283
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:04,556
What are you gonna do?

284
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,862
She's not sleeping around.
She's not gambling it away.

285
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:09,843
She hasn't even spent any of it.
So I don't see a reason to do anything.

286
00:14:10,386 --> 00:14:11,846
You don't think a conversation...

287
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,259
How many people do you know
in completely happy

288
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,150
and fulfilled relationships?

289
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:18,398
- None.
- I am.

290
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:22,040
Most people cling to some storybook
notion of what a relationship is.

291
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,860
You can't have an imperfect thought.

292
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,005
You can't have a private zone...

293
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,488
Steal money and hide it away
in a secret account?

294
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,832
She makes me happy.
I make her happy. It works.

295
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,848
Because we don't do storybook.

296
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:36,157
And I don't plan
to poke into her business.

297
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:45,304
You were right about the dialysis.

298
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:48,101
He made it through the night without
any more seizures or visual symptoms.

299
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,551
And I am going to be just as right
after breakfast up in my office.

300
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:54,400
The only difference is i'm gonna
be right in front of other people.

301
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,708
Which means you're not here
to talk about the medicine.

302
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,763
You can screw with me at work,
but stay out of my personal life.

303
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,474
What did she say?

304
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:03,273
Did you hear what I said?

305
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:05,868
I heard the part about you can
screw with me at work all you want.

306
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,535
- Want my advice?
- Of course not.

307
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:09,714
Good, 'cause I have no idea
what you should do.

308
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,381
I only know what you're going to do.

309
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:14,124
- I said I didn't want your advice.
- I said this is not advice.

310
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:16,406
You are going to forgive her
for opening that account,

311
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:18,556
and you're going to confess
everything you've done,

312
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,381
and you're gonna beg her
to forgive you.

313
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,538
What purpose
could that possibly serve?

314
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:25,074
None... which is why
i'm not saying you should.

315
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:26,595
But you will.

316
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,226
What's your end game?

317
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:34,816
Where are you?

318
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:35,828
At the track.

319
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:37,657
That's, like, six miles away.

320
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:40,600
- How cool are these things?
- I feel like an idiot.

321
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,135
I'm not giving you
any more of my stuff.

322
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:50,131
You have those night vision goggles?

323
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,457
No.

324
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:54,577
- You're lying.
- You like making him miserable.

325
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:57,191
You like driving people away from you.

326
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:58,762
He deserved to know the truth.

327
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,547
There was no truth
until you dug it up.

328
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,722
You do know that stuff exists even
when you can't see it, right?

329
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:07,094
It was a truth that mattered to him
and a truth that mattered to her.

330
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:08,855
Why did it matter to you?

331
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:10,764
First of all, stop saying "a" truth.

332
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:12,645
There is only one truth.

333
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:14,434
That may be true for you.

334
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,104
Miserable people save more lives.

335
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:20,021
If your life has meaning,
your job doesn't have to have meaning.

336
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:23,515
Screw-ups are more palatable
if you have someone's arms to go cry in.

337
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:25,355
Yeah, that makes sense.

338
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:27,594
Usually I have more
of a fight on that one.

339
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:29,575
So why
are you making Taub miserable?

340
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:30,783
I just said!

341
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:32,912
He left his last job
to save his marriage.

342
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:36,112
If his marriage falls apart, you think
he'll be working harder for you?

343
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:38,375
Or you think
he won't be working for you at all?

344
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,632
His head and neck
are completely swollen.

345
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,675
I need a trache kit.
His throat's closing.

346
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,808
- Can't find any landmarks.
- Just start cutting.

347
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:57,590
- An exploratory trache?
- We don't have a choice.

348
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:00,689
Got it. Here.

349
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:13,286
His face is so swollen
it squeezed his tear ducts shut.

350
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:15,172
We've been lubricating
his eyes by hand.

351
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:18,109
We started him on steroids,
IV and cream, to reduce the swelling,

352
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:21,388
- but it's having limited effect.
- Negative for thrombosis and chagas.

353
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,444
- Could be infection.
- Culture's still negative.

354
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,296
Could be his immune system's
on hyperdrive. Cytokine storm.

355
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,885
Why would you pay for a three-year
gym membership and only go twice?

356
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,141
Sorry. You guys still diagnosing?

357
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:38,192
Thought we'd finished hours ago.
You remember,

358
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:40,719
when we decided it was the unproven,
unapproved cocktail of drugs

359
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,269
he's been downing like...

360
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:44,012
Like a cocktail.

361
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:46,153
He just completed a total dialysis.

362
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,821
If it was the drugs, he'd be better.

363
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,584
Or he'd be worse.

364
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,533
I take it none of you saw trainspotting.

365
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:54,593
You think swelling
is a symptom of withdrawal?

366
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:56,738
It's a coincidence that
3 new symptoms cropped up

367
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:59,587
- as soon as we took him off the drugs?
- It's possible some of the symptoms

368
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:02,385
Either the drugs are the answer,
or the drugs are a coincidence.

369
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:04,647
If it's one, we have to find
a better way to detox him.

370
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,581
If it's two,
we have to know which symptoms

371
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:09,007
are withdrawal-related before
we can formulate a diagnosis.

372
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,635
Which means we have to find
a better way to detox him.

373
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:13,385
So how do we do it?

374
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,147
Hair of the drug that bit him.

375
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,895
That's ridiculous.
If it is the drugs, they're dangerous...

376
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:21,419
That's why we're gonna put him back on
the drugs, and then wean him off again.

377
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,225
Just much slower.

378
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:26,480
Why are you looking at him?

379
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,083
Try it out.

380
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,462
You heard the boss! Go!

381
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:37,192
- Taub.
- I didn't talk to her.

382
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:47,375
Why are you...

383
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:48,940
Excuse me.

384
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:50,391
Sorry.

385
00:18:58,675 --> 00:19:01,197
- He does look like me, doesn't he?
- You gave him your hat.

386
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,499
I needed you out of here,
I could go through your desk.

387
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:04,547
Of course.

388
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:05,814
Nice blouse.

389
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:07,525
I really like that color on you.

390
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:10,652
Tell house that if he wants to know
what I'm doing, all he has to do...

391
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:12,613
It's not house, it's... It's me.

392
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:14,070
I was, I don't know.

393
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,927
I was thinking maybe we could get
together for a drink or something.

394
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:19,653
I wasn't sure exactly what
you like to do. So I thought...

395
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:21,427
- You'd spy on me.
- No. No.

396
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:23,146
Not spying. More like research.

397
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:25,435
I think it's a good idea
to get to know a little bit more

398
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,289
about a woman before you ask her out.

399
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:30,398
Show you care about more than
just what she looks like.

400
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,758
As romantic as you make that sound,

401
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:36,147
i'm pretty sure that
what you're doing is...

402
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:38,388
Not so much caring as creepy.

403
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:39,884
That's not fair.

404
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,805
- You were scrounging through my desk.
- What the hell am I gonna find out?

405
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:45,841
You went to michigan. You like
your sandwiches a little light on mayo.

406
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,555
You stay in touch with your mother.

407
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:51,600
You rented the english patient and you
gave money to amnesty international.

408
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,717
There's not one thing
I can find out in here that

409
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:56,406
you wouldn't tell a coworker
while riding in an elevator.

410
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:00,661
I'm not a creep.
I just thought you seemed interesting.

411
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:03,914
I'll go now.

412
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:07,212
Yeah, these, um...

413
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,260
I'll give you embarrassing
info on house.

414
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:19,972
- In exchange for...
- No, no need for a date.

415
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,478
You'd be employing me, so...

416
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:24,685
I'd have all the time in the world
to ask you all about you,

417
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:27,830
and it would fall under the category of
socializing instead of creepy stalking.

418
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,773
- And I'd be paying you?
- I know it's weird.

419
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:32,317
But if you pay me while I check you out,
it's all cool.

420
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:34,862
And you get value,
you get leverage against him.

421
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:36,280
Help you keep him in line.

422
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,524
You think I need help
keeping house in line?

423
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:42,158
Nope, sorry.

424
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,538
This hospital can't afford...

425
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:47,749
Oh, whatever you can afford.

426
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,797
How'd you know I liked roses?

427
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:55,643
I was in your house last night.

428
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,569
No! I'm kidding.

429
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:01,476
Who the hell doesn't like roses?

430
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:16,295
I forgot to tell you.

431
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:18,935
The parker quartet's gonna
play at the library fundraiser.

432
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,367
That's it?

433
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,082
It was your idea.

434
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:28,340
They'll be great.

435
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:36,549
You okay?

436
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:40,508
I couldn't find the letter opener.

437
00:21:41,415 --> 00:21:43,347
I went through some of the
drawers in your desk

438
00:21:43,956 --> 00:21:45,004
looking for it.

439
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,808
There were a bunch of statements

440
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:51,040
There were a bunch of statements
in there from jefferson mutual.

441
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:02,282
I was so close.

442
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:04,409
To what?

443
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:08,289
You've got $83,000 socked
away in a secret account.

444
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:09,936
Not anymore.

445
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:15,167
I wanted to keep it a surprise, but...

446
00:22:18,243 --> 00:22:20,366
I bought you a car.

447
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,869
The one that...
that I...

448
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,803
I knew you would never
buy it yourself, so...

449
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,308
I've been saving.

450
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:38,401
And it's gonna be delivered on friday.

451
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,421
You are amazing.

452
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:47,622
Lucky you.

453
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,496
We've gradually reduced your dosage.

454
00:22:56,048 --> 00:22:57,437
You're actually drug-free now.

455
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:58,625
I feel great.

456
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,797
Thanks to you.

457
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,358
All part of the job.

458
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:03,563
Your blood pressure's normal.

459
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:04,683
Can you sit up?

460
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,709
What are you--ohh!

461
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:20,387
What happened to his face?

462
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:22,277
Question is what
happened to his hormones?

463
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:24,354
We're gonna need an ice pack in here!

464
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:30,579
We can rule out the clinical
trial drugs at this point.

465
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:32,788
His system has been
completely cleaned twice.

466
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:35,071
Unless the drugs found
a hiding place under the stairs.

467
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:37,412
Drugs could have set off
a dormant neurological condition.

468
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:38,532
Good point.

469
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,964
Coming clean can cause a lot of damage.

470
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,383
Alienation, divorce.

471
00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:45,468
My wife's buying me a car.

472
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:48,888
I was talking about the patient.

473
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:51,291
- You were wrong.
- Divorce was metaphorical.

474
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:53,661
What about kluver-bucy syndrome?

475
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,479
Bilateral lesions in the temporal lobes,

476
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,856
visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality
are the key symptoms.

477
00:23:58,016 --> 00:23:59,774
Good thing he's got that girlfriend.

478
00:23:59,894 --> 00:24:02,569
If it's kluver-bucy, his brain'll
melt down, he'll try to swallow

479
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:05,587
his own hands, and she can take care of
him for the rest of his talentless life.

480
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:06,864
You owe me an apology.

481
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:08,992
Any rationalization you had
for meddling in

482
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:10,869
my private life disappeared when she had

483
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,020
- good reason...
- You're right.

484
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:16,249
Fact is, nothing I said applies.

485
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:18,793
You had no reason to forgive her.

486
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:20,788
Therefore,
no reason to seek forgiveness.

487
00:24:20,908 --> 00:24:22,365
No reason to be an idiot.

488
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:28,612
Kluver-bucy wouldn't explain
the seizure or the cytokine storm.

489
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:30,096
Withdrawal complications.

490
00:24:30,257 --> 00:24:32,381
Then again, she is handing you
a giant gift

491
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:33,934
you don't think you deserve.

492
00:24:34,094 --> 00:24:36,394
The fact the M.R.I. showed
no lesions on the temporal lobe

493
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:38,855
tends to rule out your lesions
on the temporal lobe theory.

494
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:41,399
The damage can be a circulatory
issue rather than structural.

495
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,108
We wouldn't see that on the M.R.I.

496
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:44,236
Foreman's right.

497
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:46,530
Go call your wife,
tell her you're not coming home

498
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:49,015
'cause you have to give
the patient a cranial M. R. Angiogram.

499
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:51,593
Then say good night and hang up.

500
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:15,831
Odd that a man who can't run

501
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:18,292
would own so many pairs of sneakers.

502
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:20,943
You mind hanging this
up when you're done?

503
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:24,354
I have to find something
embarrassing about you.

504
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:25,569
No, you don't.

505
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:27,807
I ordered us indian.

506
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:31,247
Not too embarrassing,
just something credible.

507
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:33,459
Well, if you hand her that...

508
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:35,203
She's not gonna need you anymore.

509
00:25:35,363 --> 00:25:37,854
If I don't hand her anything,
she'll think i'm incompetent.

510
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:40,250
I don't care if she
thinks you're incompetent.

511
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:42,575
This isn't gonna work.

512
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:44,212
It's worked so far.

513
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:46,173
No, I'm no good at lying.

514
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:47,381
I know.

515
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:50,480
That's why your cover
is that you want to do her.

516
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,095
I like her.
I don't wanna do her.

517
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,931
Then what's the point of liking her?

518
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:57,767
I meant I don't just want to do her.
I like her.

519
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,756
What do you think you're
gonna find out about her?

520
00:26:01,782 --> 00:26:03,670
Something... personal.

521
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,982
Something embarrassing.

522
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:08,793
I've spent half my life
negotiating with that woman.

523
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:11,801
Anything I can use to
scare her into saying yes.

524
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,551
Okay.

525
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:21,082
Okay?

526
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:24,917
You're okay with being paid
twice to facilitate blackmail?

527
00:26:25,037 --> 00:26:25,810
I'm okay.

528
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,554
I don't believe you, but I'm okay.

529
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:31,384
You're doing this for
the same reason I'm doing this.

530
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:34,351
We'll see who gets there first.

531
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:41,422
Here it is. Circle of Willis,
the vessels are narrow.

532
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,680
Narrow for you, normal for him.

533
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,484
If there were problems with the vessels,
he'd have had symptoms long ago.

534
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:49,611
Not if something else changed.

535
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:51,363
- Like?
- His heart.

536
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:53,714
He could have recently gotten
an intermittent arrhythmia.

537
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:56,134
I know "heart" and "head" start
with the same three letters,

538
00:26:56,254 --> 00:26:58,368
but you gotta read all the way
to the end.

539
00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:00,642
The experimental drug
is causing arrhythmia,

540
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:02,298
which causes low blood pressure.

541
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:05,210
Combine that with those narrow vessels,
the brain doesn't get enough blood.

542
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:07,359
That causes all of his symptoms.

543
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,476
If we can trigger the arrhythmia
and identify it,

544
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:12,454
we might be able to stop it
from killing him.

545
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:15,720
- Been home?
- No.

546
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,779
Good.

547
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:20,290
Do an E.P. study.
Find the arrhythmia.

548
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:25,858
We're gonna insert three
electrocatheters into your heart.

549
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,422
Tell Dr. Hadley i'm sorry.

550
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,542
She understands.

551
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:30,236
And you should tell her yourself.

552
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:32,984
- Maybe I should tell heather about...
- You're gonna be fine.

553
00:27:33,104 --> 00:27:34,545
She's just so supportive.

554
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:37,075
And so great.
All I do is lie to her.

555
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,910
What happens if you tell her?

556
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:41,732
I don't know.

557
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:43,261
You love her, right?

558
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:45,126
More than anything, and she loves me.

559
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,297
If you open your mouth,
one of two things happens.

560
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,296
She either forgives
you or she leaves you.

561
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:51,963
At best, you wind up exactly
where you are right now.

562
00:27:52,795 --> 00:27:54,434
It's noble to want to confess.

563
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:55,547
Really, it is.

564
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:59,049
But if the result's just
damage and pain, that's not noble.

565
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:00,360
That's selfish.

566
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:04,936
Stimulate right atrium.

567
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:07,230
No more conduction.

568
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,737
How long you plan on
keeping me from going home?

569
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:12,082
Until you're convinced
I'm a different person,

570
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:14,301
one who won't do anything stupid?

571
00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:16,986
Guilt fades quickly.

572
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:18,700
By wednesday, you'll be fine.

573
00:28:19,577 --> 00:28:20,617
Right ventricle.

574
00:28:20,778 --> 00:28:22,548
And why do you want it to fade?

575
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,675
Why do you suddenly
care about my marriage?

576
00:28:24,795 --> 00:28:25,797
Because...

577
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:28,500
- If it ain't broke...
- You obviously think it is broke.

578
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:30,170
You obviously think it ain't.

579
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,806
Your marriage is a broken toaster.

580
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:34,101
The bread keeps popping out,
and you calling it toast.

581
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:36,676
Which is weird, because you've
put your bread in a lot of toasters.

582
00:28:36,836 --> 00:28:39,346
Apparently, you don't see any
difference. It's kind of fascinating.

583
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:41,555
- He's going into v-tach.
- What's wrong?

584
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:43,558
Good news...
The test is working.

585
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:46,311
Your heart's freaking out, but
it's cool that you're still conscious.

586
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,668
Try to overdrive.

587
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:49,882
Didn't work.

588
00:28:56,412 --> 00:28:58,636
This might burn a little bit.
Charging to 60.

589
00:28:58,817 --> 00:28:59,593
Clear.

590
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:03,619
Going again, charging to 120.

591
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,734
Are you dyeing your hair?

592
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,290
No.

593
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,397
House, clear.

594
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:10,517
Right.

595
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:15,298
The hair is growing in red.

596
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:18,843
His heart rate is stabilized.

597
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,053
Does your theory include any

598
00:29:21,214 --> 00:29:23,981
genetic mutations that could cause
his hair to change color?

599
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,603
Either he's lying about dyeing...

600
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:30,653
Or just... dying.

601
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:36,320
Red hair means it's not kluver-bucy.

602
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,692
Melanin affects hair color.
What affects melanin?

603
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:39,572
Hormones.

604
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:41,449
- Hormone panels were all normal.
- Age.

605
00:29:42,098 --> 00:29:43,701
He's turning prematurely crimson?

606
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:44,952
A genetic disorder.

607
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:48,071
Waardenburg syndrome causes
arrhythmias and can change hair color.

608
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:49,790
And make you deaf.
Next.

609
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,542
Found a long qt interval.

610
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:53,149
I think it's romano-ward syndrome.

611
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,068
Explains the irregular heart rhythms.

612
00:29:55,188 --> 00:29:56,398
But not the ginger nut.

613
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:58,945
If he's got romano's,
he's got at least five gene mutations.

614
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:01,636
Not a big leap to think he has
others that would give him the hair.

615
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:04,097
It gives him the likelihood
of sudden and unexpected death.

616
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:05,709
Beta blockers don't work.

617
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:07,601
His heart can't handle an I.C.D.

618
00:30:08,437 --> 00:30:09,269
Pete best.

619
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:15,650
Good God!

620
00:30:15,811 --> 00:30:17,610
Has none of you ever
read a history book?

621
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:19,486
The original beatles drummer.

622
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:22,447
A bunch of nerves controls
the tempo of the heart.

623
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:25,039
They're all playing in time,
except one dude can't keep the beat.

624
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,662
Wrecks the whole thing.
So we hire Ringo.

625
00:30:27,822 --> 00:30:29,456
Pete best was actually a great drummer,

626
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:32,000
but I assume you mean the patient needs
a cardiac sympathectomy.

627
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,876
Probably should have
just said that, huh?

628
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:36,833
Start cutting nerves, you risk
his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating.

629
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:39,424
So he saves a fortune on
karaoke machines and deodorant.

630
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:42,422
You think he's stable
enough for surgery?

631
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,938
If he was, he wouldn't need it.

632
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,061
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

633
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:01,362
One sister.

634
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:03,495
He told me he was on the lacrosse team.

635
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:04,560
In high school.

636
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,368
In college, he just cheered
the lacrosse team on to victory.

637
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,054
How was your relationship with your dad?

638
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:12,886
Fine.

639
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:14,374
You have three more questions.

640
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:16,737
- How was your relationship with mom?
- Fine.

641
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:18,658
When did you lose your virginity?

642
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,462
Not something I'd discuss
with coworkers in an elevator.

643
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:25,775
And...

644
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:28,015
and...

645
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:32,428
you know, don't you?

646
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:38,119
A bit of a wasted third question.

647
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:40,399
'cause the answer is "know what?"

648
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,199
Okay, bear with me here.

649
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,682
Because some people sometimes consider
my thought processes complicated.

650
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:47,825
I'm into you, 'cause you're hot.

651
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:49,551
And smart.

652
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:51,866
In that order, but both are needed.

653
00:31:51,986 --> 00:31:53,319
Photos can be retouched.

654
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,177
And house is an evil genius,
which makes this photo suspicious.

655
00:31:57,523 --> 00:31:59,169
And yet you're not suspicious.

656
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:02,149
Which means either you're not smart
enough to be suspicious, in which case,

657
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:04,133
I am less interested in you,

658
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:07,696
or you're not suspicious
because you know

659
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:10,556
this is actually a doctored
photo of House.

660
00:32:10,676 --> 00:32:13,518
In which case,
I am more interested in you.

661
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:16,271
But I am wasting my time,
because you know

662
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:19,332
this is a game we are playing on you,
and I am busted.

663
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:20,650
And I'm screwed.

664
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,872
I know the photo's a fake.

665
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:27,585
And I know this is a game.

666
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,399
I'm sorry.

667
00:32:32,544 --> 00:32:33,551
Too bad.

668
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:37,907
Good-bye.

669
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:48,377
So you knew that I wasn't
gonna give you anything worthwhile?

670
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:51,139
And you were never gonna
give me anything worthwhile.

671
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,408
Then why did you bother
coming out with me?

672
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:58,112
I... wanted to screw with House.

673
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,646
By wasting my time?

674
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:02,748
That doesn't make sense.

675
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:05,552
No...

676
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:08,488
there must be another reason.

677
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:13,019
Is it okay if I sit back down here?

678
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:19,682
Your heartbeat's out of control.

679
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:22,953
We need to surgically sever the
connection between your heart and brain.

680
00:33:23,347 --> 00:33:26,407
We believe it's necessary,
but you need to know the ramifications.

681
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,384
You'll never be able to feel angina.

682
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:30,746
You may not know if
you have a heart attack.

683
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:32,871
You may not be able to get help in time.

684
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:34,514
Where are my regular doctors?

685
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:36,434
Regular doctors?

686
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:38,275
Dr. Taub and Dr. Hadley.

687
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:40,352
Why aren't they telling me this?

688
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:43,441
Brandon, I am dr. Hadley.
And this is Dr. Taub.

689
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,053
What are you talking about?

690
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:48,602
I've never seen you before in my life.

691
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:56,056
We can't do the surgery.

692
00:33:56,176 --> 00:33:57,989
We're back where we started.
Visual agnosia.

693
00:33:58,109 --> 00:33:59,897
We need to reexamine
neurological disorders.

694
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:02,255
- Something's slowly progressing.
- This isn't progressing.

695
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,705
It's there, then it's not, then it is.
It's a new symptom, intermittence.

696
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:08,664
It's irrelevant.

697
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:10,538
Since when is a new symptom irrelevant?

698
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:12,436
Since it points towards
the same disease.

699
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,173
Intermittence can fit with romano-ward.

700
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:17,165
- We still need to do a sympathectomy.
- Maybe we missed something.

701
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:18,605
- Toxins.
- When?

702
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,576
When you checked every bottle,
every can, every tube of paint?

703
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:23,166
Or when you detoxed him twice?

704
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:26,555
Maybe there is a batch of toxic
paint that he used up a few months ago.

705
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:28,620
Then he would have been
sick months ago, not now.

706
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,247
He's lost weight since he got here.

707
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,707
That's a symptom of trying to cram
hospital food down a throat

708
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:34,137
he can barely get air down.

709
00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:36,869
It's not a symptom,
but what if the toxins were stored

710
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:38,672
in his fat cells a year ago,

711
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:41,135
and now they're being released
into his bloodstream?

712
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:45,679
So where you gonna get this old paint?
City dump?

713
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:47,171
On his old paintings.

714
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:49,205
We know he hasn't sold one in ages.

715
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:52,176
But there weren't many in his studio.
He's hid them somewhere.

716
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:54,848
If you're wrong...

717
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:57,593
He could drop dead from
romano-ward at any moment.

718
00:34:57,713 --> 00:34:58,766
You okay with that?

719
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:00,406
Just give me a few hours.

720
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,143
You got one.

721
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:10,945
I need to talk to him alone.

722
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:13,122
It's about your work.

723
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:14,394
Your paintings.

724
00:35:14,736 --> 00:35:17,808
I need to look at all
the ones you've sold recently.

725
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:26,377
- Honey, can you give us a minute?
- To talk about your paintings?

726
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:29,881
Brandon, please.

727
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,465
Tell me what's going on.

728
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:42,393
I've only sold two paintings
in the last... three years.

729
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:44,851
Since we met.

730
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:47,442
One was to my cousin.

731
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,715
I've been making money
enrolling in drug trials.

732
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,655
Two, three at a time.

733
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:01,662
Why did you lie to me?

734
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:04,330
I wanna be, uh...

735
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:07,840
the way you look at me.

736
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,736
The way it makes me feel.

737
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:10,963
I wanna be...

738
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:12,696
what you see...

739
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,017
when you look at me.

740
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:21,519
You think i'm that shallow?

741
00:36:22,977 --> 00:36:24,322
When I look at you...

742
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:27,200
I see you.

743
00:36:41,397 --> 00:36:42,397
So...

744
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:47,655
where are the ones you didn't sell?

745
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:17,246
It's not the paint, it's the drugs.

746
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:19,508
- He's not on the drugs.
- I know it doesn't make sense,

747
00:38:19,669 --> 00:38:21,995
but I'm looking at his paintings
for the last six months.

748
00:38:22,115 --> 00:38:25,081
They're normal april, june, and august.

749
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:28,248
But they're distorted may,
july, september.

750
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:31,604
Every other month, he was having visual
agnosia, because every other month

751
00:38:31,764 --> 00:38:33,874
he was on all
three drugs simultaneously.

752
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:36,687
The statin was one month on,
one month off.

753
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:39,779
I don't know why the symptoms keep
coming and going, but it is the drugs.

754
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:42,781
They're hiding under the stairs.

755
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:44,491
In the fat? That doesn't make sense.

756
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:47,745
- These drugs aren't fat soluble.
- I said stairs, not closet.

757
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:50,414
What was the last drug
he was on before the drugs

758
00:38:50,574 --> 00:38:52,188
he was on when the symptoms started?

759
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:53,564
I'm not sure.
I think...

760
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:54,794
Antacid.

761
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,118
- How do you know?
- It makes sense.

762
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:00,049
Also, I'm looking at the file.

763
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:05,935
Yes?

764
00:39:09,902 --> 00:39:11,003
It's Dr. House.

765
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,270
Wake him up.
We're done.

766
00:39:13,558 --> 00:39:16,231
No, no--he says he needs surgery,
but not this one.

767
00:39:16,644 --> 00:39:17,984
Did he give any specifics?

768
00:39:18,144 --> 00:39:20,861
Abdominal surgery to remove a... bezoar.

769
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:26,117
It's like a hairball,
but it's made up of undigested food.

770
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:29,829
You can get it if your stomac
acid's low, which brandon's was because

771
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:31,580
of an experimental antacid.

772
00:39:31,782 --> 00:39:34,235
Fruit and vegetable fibers and skins

773
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:36,341
get stuck together and form a ball.

774
00:39:36,622 --> 00:39:39,144
It gets sticky, ferments, grows.

775
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:42,125
It starts sucking up
some of the pills he'd taken.

776
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:43,815
Some are never heard from again.

777
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:45,344
But some get released.

778
00:39:45,588 --> 00:39:48,131
For the last week, it's basically
been giving him massive doses

779
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:49,818
of all three at once.

780
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:55,875
And that...

781
00:39:55,995 --> 00:39:58,187
is why I won't let cameron buy a cat.

782
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:00,545
He should be fine.

783
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:05,573
Are you glad he told you the truth?

784
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,922
Yes... of course.

785
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,498
But...

786
00:40:12,406 --> 00:40:14,439
were you happier before you knew?

787
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:25,266
About ten more feet.

788
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,126
I do know what it looks like,
so maybe this whole blindfold thing--

789
00:40:29,246 --> 00:40:31,660
My gift, my rules.
Bump.

790
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,690
All right, if you don't like the color,
apparently we can exchange it.

791
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:36,971
But I'm hoping.

792
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:38,561
You ready?

793
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:46,956
Do you like it?

794
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:55,790
Baby, are you okay?

795
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:06,387
We need to talk.

796
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,693
She didn't buy it.

797
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:33,813
Damn.

798
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,289
So you didn't get anything.

799
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:38,690
Nothin'.

800
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,881
We probably overstepped.

801
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,137
You're really not the cheerleader type.

802
00:41:43,882 --> 00:41:45,054
On the other hand,

803
00:41:45,872 --> 00:41:48,509
I figured she probably wouldn't figure
me as the "photoshopping"

804
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:51,897
a photo and planting it in
an obscure college paper" type either.

805
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:55,495
About that.

806
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:59,228
I took a little trip to your alma mater.

807
00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:04,511
You took a little trip 150 miles.

808
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:06,381
Online, by phone.

809
00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:08,640
I meant I did research.

810
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,161
That's a real photo, isn't it?

811
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:20,715
Wow, that is humiliating.

812
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,836
There was a girl.

813
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:27,740
Even more so.

814
00:42:28,466 --> 00:42:29,571
That's too bad.

815
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:31,632
You wanted her to see you
in a different light,

816
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:33,566
and... not only didn't she see it...

817
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:36,719
she didn't even believe it was possible.

818
00:42:38,126 --> 00:42:41,187
You know, people hate people
who have theories about people.

819
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:53,275
- You want me to back off?
- Would you?

820
00:42:54,388 --> 00:42:55,492
I barely know you.
