1
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:39,916
Bring it up about six more feet.

2
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,587
Okay, you can go ahead
and start dropping it.

3
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:13,907
Class is over.

4
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:16,682
What's going on? Who are you?

5
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,019
I'm a doctor.

6
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:20,267
Did you have a corneal transplant
5 years ago?

7
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:21,349
Yes.

8
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:24,565
Every patient who had a transplanted
organ from that donor is dead or dying.

9
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,462
You got a purse?

10
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,714
I feel fine.

11
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,308
I don't mean to scare you,
but so did the others.

12
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:39,202
House - Season 05 Episode 02
"Not a cancer"

13
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:46,120
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak.

14
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:03,061
www.house-fr.com

15
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:11,109
One living, one almost dead.

16
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,773
Four fully dead.

17
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,946
Nothing in common
except their donor.

18
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,748
Carl got a new heart and lung.

19
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:18,270
Liver kills him.

20
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,924
Tibalt got a new liver,
lung killed him.

21
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:23,497
Holly got a new kidney,
her heart blows up.

22
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:26,320
And Frank, the old guy
gasping for breath upstairs,

23
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,673
he got an intestinal graft,
his pancreas is failing.

24
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,600
All within eight months
of each other.

25
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,590
And in each case, serious complications
came on suddenly and without warning.

26
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:37,384
Which means arrhythmia, massive
pulmonary embolus, or cerebral bleed.

27
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,513
What did Wilson do for me?

28
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,374
If the donor had an infection
that somehow slipped by a screening,

29
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,522
- it could lay dormant.
- Five organ systems hit.

30
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,539
Would need five infections for it
to somehow slip by screening.

31
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,321
Oh, sure, he made me laugh
on a rainy day,

32
00:03:54,743 --> 00:03:56,634
made me see the colors
I never knew...

33
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,321
None of the donated organs were hit.

34
00:03:58,441 --> 00:04:00,240
Whatever they got is
from the donor's blood.

35
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,492
- That wouldn't help us narrow down.
- To who.

36
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:05,299
Corneal transplants are bloodless.
It means Apple's gonna be fine.

37
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,933
You secure enough in that theory
to send her home?

38
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:10,584
I guess we could wait till we figure out
what's wrong with Frank.

39
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:13,895
On the other hand...
Gilbert Gottfried makes me laugh.

40
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,757
And how many colors
are there really?

41
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:17,414
Once you got red, blue and green...

42
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:20,166
He paid for your lunch, liked monster
trucks, and was your conscience.

43
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:21,770
- Autoimmune disease.
- A.N.A.

44
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,517
Autopsy of all victims were normal.

45
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:24,948
Wouldn't cover vasculitis.

46
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:28,270
- Henoch-Schonlein purpura...
- Antiphospholipid antibodies, normal.

47
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,483
- Then that leaves cancer.
- Cancers have names.

48
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,148
They have a progression.
They affect specific organs.

49
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:35,275
Bone cancer can't turn into
liver cancer.

50
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,602
Forget cancer.

51
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:38,726
It's cancer.

52
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:41,016
It's not cancer.

53
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,569
You're right, of course.
What was I thinking?

54
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,012
No single type of cancer blew up
three organs in the chest

55
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,074
while also herniating
in the fighter's brain stem

56
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:50,389
- The fighter's irrelevant.
- You don't like coincidences.

57
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,641
It'd be a coincidence
if six transplant recipients

58
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:54,210
had nothing else wrong with them.

59
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,751
Like being an idiot, which leads
to getting your head knocked off.

60
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:58,021
The others had cancer.

61
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:01,638
Four autopsies and about
1,000 lab tests say it's not cancer.

62
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:04,054
Redo the thousand tests
and the four autopsies.

63
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:06,352
Taub, Kutner, check out the donor.
Find out which cancer.

64
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,679
He didn't die of cancer. His head got
chopped off in an industrial accident.

65
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,732
Find out which cancer
would've killed him.

66
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,938
Check the home and
office for carcinogens, toxins.

67
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:17,192
He's been dead for four years. I guess
his home's been rented to someone else.

68
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:19,379
Find out which cancer killed them.

69
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,017
Did I forget you?

70
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:25,740
You can check out the patient's eye.

71
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,175
Put this on Dr. O'shea.

72
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:40,839
And some chips.

73
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:44,105
- Forget your wallet, House?
- No.

74
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,175
I'll take care of it.

75
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,212
Check.

76
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:54,491
Are you following me?

77
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:56,819
Word is...

78
00:05:57,956 --> 00:05:59,232
you're into monster trucks.

79
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:01,609
- My kids like it.
- But not you?

80
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,904
Predator's okay, but I think
the California crusher is overrated.

81
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,121
Are you checking me out?

82
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:14,789
You're astute.

83
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:17,295
No.

84
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:20,545
- How many pills did you just take?
- Vicodin, opioids,

85
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,037
some b12.

86
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,272
Need a little kick in the afternoon.

87
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:26,597
You got a problem with that?

88
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,471
I think I'm falling in love.

89
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:31,580
Her right eye's failing.

90
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,117
No, it's not.

91
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:35,894
Everyone else's transplanted organs
were fine. It means her eye is fine.

92
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,835
- We need to remove the eye.
- It's her only working eye.

93
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:41,549
We could remove the other one,
but since it's not killing her,

94
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,658
I thought this way was less insane.

95
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,109
Do you have some...

96
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:49,773
ethical problem with what I'm doing that
you could express in a unique way which

97
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:52,688
might  make me think that I'm wrong
even though I'll never admit it?

98
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:53,674
Yes.

99
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,018
You are funny.

100
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:59,729
The problem's not in her eye.
It's in her head.

101
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:03,087
You wanna come over, watch Prescription
Passion at my place tonight?

102
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:05,830
- You know I'm not gay, right?
- Neither am I.

103
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,223
If you don't want to have sex,
that's cool with me.

104
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:11,363
- I'm not coming over to your home.
- I'll grow on you.

105
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:16,685
L...

106
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:17,909
P...

107
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:19,079
E...

108
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,962
Do I have to be
in the same room as him?

109
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,769
Whatever he's got, you've got.

110
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,777
- Fifth line.
- Are you sure?

111
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:26,975
Pretty sure.

112
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:28,640
Fifth line.

113
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,152
Am I gonna die?

114
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:36,079
Can we talk about something
besides you for a moment?

115
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,747
Like maybe the fifth line?

116
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,220
F... E...

117
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,253
O... S... P.

118
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:46,836
Damn.

119
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,717
I'm sorry.
We need to remove your eye.

120
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,052
My eye?

121
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,143
A moment ago,
you thought you were dying.

122
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:55,003
Blind's actually good news.

123
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,825
Unfortunately, he's wrong.

124
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,273
- You just did the test.
- She didn't squint.

125
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:01,145
Which means
the eye thinks it's fine.

126
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:03,355
- It was wrong.
- I know. The eye doesn't think.

127
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,667
The brain thinks, which means if
the thinking's wrong, the brain's wrong.

128
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,491
Which means
it's spread to the brain,

129
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:10,947
which means it's too late for us
to remove the eye.

130
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:12,520
Which means...

131
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:15,577
We're gonna have to remove
your whole head.

132
00:08:15,743 --> 00:08:18,011
Don't worry. It doesn't hurt.

133
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:25,551
Hallucination.

134
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:27,833
That's a brain thing, right?

135
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:33,410
500 different things
can cause hallucination.

136
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,963
Doesn't mean it's neurological.

137
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,330
It does if one of the other organ
recipients also had a brain issue.

138
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:41,841
- Did he just drop his hands?
- No, none of them had brain issues.

139
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:45,490
If his pupils dilated, if his pupils
were fixed, if there was a twitch...

140
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,408
He got hit in the head,
he died, no mystery.

141
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,402
- That was your point.
- Yesterday.

142
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:51,959
You live, you learn.

143
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,094
Who shot this?

144
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,845
Guy who runs the gym has a camera.

145
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,306
Uploads the nasty stuff online.

146
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:00,317
Can't see the dead guy's face.

147
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,052
I can't see his face,

148
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,888
can't see the twitch,
can't see the pupils.

149
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,967
We know the tennis player
had a heart problem.

150
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:10,032
We can maybe tie that
to the tuba player's lungs,

151
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:13,280
and then somehow tie both those things,
to the construction worker's liver,

152
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:16,480
and then possibly meander over
to Frank's pancreatic failure, but

153
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,019
nothing causes simultaneous
brain and heart problems.

154
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:21,405
Cancer made no sense.

155
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:23,733
The head and heart
make less than no sense.

156
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:25,452
That makes no sense.

157
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:31,257
I know... I was making a point.

158
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:34,260
Oh, good.
I thought you were an idiot.

159
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:37,346
Why are you talking?

160
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:41,100
Oh, the guy doing manual labor
can't have an opinion?

161
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:46,022
I might be a genius
who just happens to have a passion

162
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:47,741
for fixing coffee machines.

163
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,569
No, I'm obviously not, but that's rude
to make assumptions about people.

164
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:55,037
Donor's history came up clean.

165
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:00,327
- Did he just laugh?
- No, no, I sneezed.

166
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:02,538
He's a genius coffee repairman.

167
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:05,104
Coffee repairman
who wears argyle socks?

168
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:08,669
I thought I already talked
about not judging.

169
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,185
What kind of idiot wears argyle socks
with construction boots?

170
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:15,772
I'm not an idiot.

171
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:17,094
I'm just...

172
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:19,787
I'm not good at disguises.

173
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:22,437
Who is he?

174
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:25,003
He's apparently a very bad
private investigator.

175
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:27,313
Why is he pretending
to fix the coffee machine?

176
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:29,844
Because I wanted to find out
what you guys found out

177
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,784
before I find out what he found out.

178
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:34,399
So I can find out if I need
a private investigator.

179
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:36,177
So, nu?

180
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:39,333
There's no history
of unusual infections, no...

181
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:41,744
international travel
in the 12 months...

182
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:46,883
No, seriously, that's how I sneeze.

183
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:51,128
He was in Madrid and the Bahamas.

184
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,881
- Credit card receipts showed no...
- Girlfriend paid.

185
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,307
- There is no girlfriend.
- She was his high school sweetie.

186
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:58,095
She's married to his best friend.

187
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,144
I know.

188
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,672
She had a kid four years ago.

189
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,183
Timing fits.
She's still pretty hot though.

190
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:06,894
- You find out anything medical?
- The kid has a tummy ache.

191
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,673
Also, the dead guy
was exposed to mercury,

192
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,395
mold,
and hydrous perchloric acid because

193
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:15,816
their sex pad was next
to a garage that was demolished

194
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,576
after those toxins were found.

195
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:19,576
Oh, yeah, that will be

196
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:21,536
$2,300.

197
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:25,830
- I'll get you a check.
- No, I don't take checks.

198
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:28,372
- You think I'm gonna stop payment?
- Aren't you?

199
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:31,627
Of course, I am.
$2,300. That's insane.

200
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,997
Actually, that price includes
footage of the boxing

201
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:35,675
match from four different angles.

202
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,384
30% of the crowd paid by credit card.
I got their names.

203
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:41,412
Four of them had digital cameras,
which I composited like NASA did for

204
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:44,348
the pics of Mars.
You know, the rovers and all that.

205
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:50,813
Pupils were dilated.

206
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:53,563
He didn't drop his hands, which
means he maintained muscle tensity.

207
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:54,682
Say it.

208
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,264
You were right.

209
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,897
God, that was petty of me.

210
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,910
He maintained muscle tensity, but was
momentarily distracted when he got hit.

211
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,220
- That's a temporal lobe seizure.
- Does that P.I. guy

212
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,615
mean we don't have to break
into people's homes anymore?

213
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:08,659
It's why you went to medical school.
I'm not gonna take that away from you.

214
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,575
- He's better than we are.
- And costs more.

215
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,703
- Gonna biopsy the brain.
- No.

216
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:15,780
- Say it.
- You were right, but no.

217
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:19,701
Temporal lobe controls speech,
hearing, memory.

218
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:23,458
She loses those things, she's gonna be
a terrific date, but beyond that...

219
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,937
We cut out a piece of it,
good chance she's a vegetable.

220
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:28,930
Nothing to hear, nothing to say,
nothing to look back on.

221
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,507
You're right.
She has so much to live for.

222
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:35,623
Do we have another patient who's
almost finished with all their living?

223
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,966
So it's okay to stab
his brain because he's old?

224
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:41,602
No, it's okay to stab his brain
because he's dead if you don't.

225
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,032
Get the widow to say yes.

226
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:46,769
No.

227
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:49,562
The lung inflammation is a complication
of the pancreatic failure,

228
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:50,920
which is reversible.

229
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:54,607
This is actually his best chance.
If we can find out what's wrong...

230
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:56,867
How can a test
that will probably kill him?

231
00:12:56,987 --> 00:12:59,115
- I didn't say.
- You said it was extremely risky.

232
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:01,658
- What does extremely mean?
- Please.

233
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:05,839
I'm sorry. I can't.

234
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:07,916
I have a husband.

235
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:11,002
I have a two-year-old daughter.
Her name is Julia.

236
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:13,031
You'd be saving her mother.

237
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:16,846
I think you're lying.

238
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:18,444
You haven't had one visitor.

239
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,707
Not one phone call since
you've been here. Does she have a child?

240
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,061
No. But her life is still worth...

241
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:31,314
- More than my husband's?
- I lied to save my life. Wouldn't you?

242
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:33,236
Not at another
human being's expense.

243
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,101
No, you'd just rob me
of my only chance

244
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:37,459
your husband can struggle
to breathe for a few more days.

245
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,542
Just shut up.
I don't want to hear from you.

246
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,528
You want to hate me
so you won't feel guilty.

247
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:42,572
Frank?

248
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:43,952
Give me a scalpel.

249
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:51,054
Charge.

250
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:02,328
He's coding.

251
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:05,171
Clear.

252
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:07,120
Clear.

253
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,738
Clear.

254
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:10,941
Clear.

255
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:12,948
Clear.

256
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:14,824
Clear.

257
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:25,603
- Did you get the consent?
- No.

258
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:28,621
Tell Foreman to get it.
Old people are scared of black people.

259
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,620
It won't matter. Patient's dead.

260
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:34,867
Save the brain.

261
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:37,797
Don't need consent for an autopsy.

262
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:06,151
Well, at best, we're gonna bat
one for six on this one.

263
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:09,096
Thin slices through the parietal
and temporal lobes were clean.

264
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:11,544
Occipital and frontotemporal
regions were also...

265
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:13,577
Brain's clean. Moving on.

266
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,941
To where? We've gone
from making no sense,

267
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:18,324
to making less sense,
and then taken a step backwards.

268
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,704
Each of these people were killed
by one thing that attacked one organ.

269
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,247
But never the same organ.

270
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:27,250
- The donor had two things wrong?
- Or six things wrong?

271
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:30,318
Metabolic diseases specialize.

272
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:31,857
Everything else specializes,

273
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:34,299
- but cancer plays the field.
- You're back to cancer?

274
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:37,343
Metastasis is just a fancy word
for screws around.

275
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,474
- Any type of cancer?
- I don't know.

276
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:41,097
There would be evidence of cancer.

277
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:42,919
There is.
We just haven't found it yet.

278
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,727
You need it to be cancer
so you have an excuse to talk to Wilson.

279
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:49,151
Give me something else that explains
this constellation of patients,

280
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:51,684
- then you can call me an ass.
- I didn't call you an ass.

281
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:53,353
Perforated intestine.

282
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:57,400
If this thing started as normal
bacteria living in the intestines

283
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,409
but got into a blood vessel through
a vascular anomaly in the bowel wall,

284
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,870
then they would affect every
organ through the blood stream.

285
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:06,164
It screws up everything.
For everyone.

286
00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:12,086
It's a long shot,
it is possible I'm an ass.

287
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,856
Ironically, we need to do
a colonoscopy to confirm.

288
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,785
We checked apple inside and out
when she came in. She's clean.

289
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:21,689
The anomaly must be intermittent
or they would've died within a day.

290
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,181
She's getting abdominal pain,

291
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,868
shove a tube up her rear
before it can get away.

292
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:27,656
And test anyone else
with stomach pain.

293
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:30,185
- Everyone else is dead.
- Not everyone.

294
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:33,785
The one thing the donor gave
to each of these people is his DNA.

295
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,068
Anyone else have his DNA?

296
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,963
You want to do a colonoscopy
on a healthy four-year-old?

297
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:44,761
She has a tummy ache. If Kutner's right,
it's not a tummy ache,

298
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:49,494
it's a fatal brain or heart
or lung or liver or pancreas ache.

299
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:51,972
I'm not gonna scare the hell
out of the poor kid's mom

300
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,642
because of a long shot corollary
to a long shot theory.

301
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:56,876
Fine.

302
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,619
Tell her the truth.

303
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:02,305
Then ask if Daddy knows
who the real Daddy is.

304
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,653
Does she have to be awake?

305
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:21,660
We need her to tell us
when it hurts.

306
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,909
She'll get over it.

307
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,492
Your husband might not have.

308
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,092
What if a kid wants ice cream?

309
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:39,089
The sign outside says "closed".

310
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,519
Dr. O'shea's not right for you.

311
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,512
- What'd you find out?
- Why are you investigating him?

312
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,350
'Cause I need to know
if he lends money interest-free.

313
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,467
What did you find out?

314
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,688
I want some ice cream.

315
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:56,816
Not until you learn to read.

316
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:02,209
- You're supposed to trust friends.
- I don't know the guy.

317
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:04,328
- I got no logical reason...
- To be his friend?

318
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:06,246
Have you never seen
an after-school special?

319
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:08,453
That's part of the pleasure
of friendship: trusting

320
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,864
without absolute evidence
and then...

321
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,723
being rewarded for that trust.

322
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,884
You're taking pictures of a guy
who's having an affair with his sister.

323
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:18,004
And you're lecturing me
about the rewards of trust.

324
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:20,318
There are two types of people
that hire me.

325
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:22,307
Actually, there are three,

326
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:24,552
but the third's irrelevant
to the point I want to make.

327
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:26,837
You have a special rate plan
for being a pain in the ass?

328
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,802
One type wants to find out
that they're right,

329
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,475
the other type that they're wrong.

330
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,988
- Which type am I?
- You're the third type.

331
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:34,761
You lead with the irrelevant types?

332
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,361
The one that doesn't care


333
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:38,858
because they've hired me
to investigate the wrong person.

334
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:41,951
- That's an actual type?
- You want me to check out Wilson.

335
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:44,892
- You want to find out if...
- How do you know about Wilson?

336
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:46,418
What do I do for a living?

337
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:48,621
Have you been checking me out?

338
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,402
- I've been paying for that?
- So far, you haven't paid for anything.

339
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:56,071
You want to find out he's pining,

340
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:59,462
if there's something about him
that will tell you he's gonna come back

341
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:01,922
or something you can use
to make him come back.

342
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:06,813
Is there?

343
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,728
No, no, there's nothing.

344
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,489
Sorry.

345
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:20,352
That will be $900.

346
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,285
I gotta go. I'll get you a check.

347
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:40,545
Colonoscopy was clean.

348
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,380
Then that just leaves cancer.

349
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,466
The fact that the kid's colonoscopy
was negative doesn't prove anything.

350
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,828
Yes, the fact that it didn't prove
anything didn't prove anything.

351
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:49,907
Excellent point.

352
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:51,819
We don't know if the kid
inherited anything.

353
00:19:51,939 --> 00:19:54,655
Even if she did, Kutner's theory
is that the thing's intermittent.

354
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:57,019
The opening would have
to be open shortly before death.

355
00:19:57,194 --> 00:19:59,848
Unfortunately, we can't know
when shortly before death is

356
00:19:59,968 --> 00:20:02,830
until shortly after death.
And that seems like an obstacle.

357
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:05,152
What if there was a way
around that?

358
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,155
Then we're kind of all sweating
over nothing.

359
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,355
Not around death,
around death as an obstacle.

360
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,173
We need to see his colon
at work.

361
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,636
You do know
what death means, right?

362
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,201
Without a living system, there's not
enough pressure to get fluid.

363
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:21,418
Life we can't create, yet,
but pressure's easy.

364
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:25,728
We use the same high pressure water jet,
we use to test cardiac workload.

365
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,145
I mean, he's not gonna be awake
to tell us where it hurts...

366
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:32,909
- It's not gonna...
- Do it.

367
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:54,252
- It's kinda stuck.
- It's more than stuck.

368
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:56,090
The bowel's been dead
for six hours.

369
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,512
No matter what
you shoot up there, it's closed.

370
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:12,303
- This is nuts.
- It's adjustable.

371
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:18,559
It's working.

372
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:24,065
- Not much.
- Increase the pressure.

373
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:29,574
The endoscope's bowing.
Push on the stomach.

374
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:34,116
Those are normal bodily fluids.

375
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,035
Yeah, normal bodily sewage.

376
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:37,625
Put the pressure back on.

377
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,293
That's the end. No leaks.

378
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,629
Wait. What's that?

379
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,872
- That's dark 'cause I'm at the end.
- What if you're not at the end?

380
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:51,792
What if it's a core lesion?

381
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:53,825
Maybe a little more pressure?

382
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:56,305
Not too much.
If it is the end and we...

383
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:05,758
It's finally accelerating.

384
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:07,985
Apple's heart rate
has become irregular.

385
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,730
Breathing is labored.

386
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,764
Colonoscopy's still showing
no leaks.

387
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:13,175
What if it is autoimmune?

388
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:16,505
What if we don't have
conversations we've already had?

389
00:22:17,193 --> 00:22:19,740
Four out of the five didn't linger.
They got sick and died.

390
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,303
We don't have time to dismiss things
we've already dismissed.

391
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:23,660
Nothing fits.

392
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:26,673
See, that's an example
of a conversation we've already had.

393
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:28,665
She's sick. Something fits.

394
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:30,417
- MS?
- No!

395
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:35,143
From now on, no one says anything
unless no one's said it before.

396
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:47,434
- Where are you going?
- You guys start immuno-gels

397
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:50,771
on her CSF to look
for hidden protein markers.

398
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,939
Start sequencing her genes.
I start treatment.

399
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:54,575
- Treatment for what?
- Cancer.

400
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:56,650
It's not cancer. Chemo's toxic.

401
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,923
It's something.

402
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:00,660
Which means we should treat her
for something.

403
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:19,114
She's fine.

404
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:22,260
- Where's her chart?
- You rang emergency to get her chart?

405
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,700
I know. That was bad of me.

406
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,809
But I'm sure the chart must be
attached to the bed

407
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:28,363
so that gimp doctors don't have
to look all over the place

408
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:29,927
while patients die.

409
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:36,650
Thank you so much.

410
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:39,653
And some peppermint tea
when you get a chance.

411
00:23:46,948 --> 00:23:48,756
I need you to sign something.

412
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:50,626
Consent to chemotherapy.

413
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,112
You found cancer?

414
00:23:56,157 --> 00:23:57,036
Then,

415
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,005
- you have tests indicating...
- Nope.

416
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:01,596
- Then why should I sign it?
- That's a good question.

417
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,307
It deserves a complicated answer.

418
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:07,320
Placebo effect.

419
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:10,559
People have confidence in doctors,

420
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:14,003
they have confidence in diagnoses,
confidence in medicine.

421
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:17,482
Sometimes they get a little better
just because they think they will.

422
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:20,713
And that can make us think that
the wrong answer is the right answer.

423
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,320
Which is very bad.

424
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:26,704
So you do have proof
that it's cancer

425
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:29,318
but you can't tell me
because it might affect

426
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:31,162
the way I react to the medicine?

427
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,590
If that were true, and it would
certainly make sense,

428
00:24:34,828 --> 00:24:37,138
do you think I could tell you
that it's true?

429
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,681
I was practically blind
before the transplant.

430
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,225
2200 vision.

431
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:54,769
Didn't you cover all this
personal stuff with Dr. Foreman?

432
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,023
You don't care who I used to be?

433
00:24:58,424 --> 00:25:01,060
You're a post-corneal transplant
math teacher.

434
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,862
I deduced that you were
a blind math teacher.

435
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:06,364
I was an architect.

436
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,234
You gave up architecture
after you could see?

437
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:16,333
The world was ugly.

438
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:22,348
You think the world would be
any different if your leg was fine?

439
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:27,928
Think you'd be any different
if your leg was fine?

440
00:25:29,008 --> 00:25:30,032
I mean,

441
00:25:30,632 --> 00:25:33,143
the doctors told me that my life
was gonna be so much better

442
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:34,560
once I could see.

443
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:36,935
I would date,
I would dance,

444
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:38,813
but...

445
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:42,567
the guys I hated dancing with before
I hate dancing with after.

446
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:45,070
My parents were still dead.

447
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:47,123
I was still alone.

448
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,576
- You're fun.
- You don't seem all that different.

449
00:25:56,963 --> 00:25:58,194
I haven't given up.

450
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:05,048
Wilson's got a new job,
hasn't started yet, but...

451
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:08,301
- So who are we following?
- See that lady up there?

452
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:10,537
- You point at the target?
- No.

453
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:13,807
No, I'm following the one halfway
in between that point and that point.

454
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,180
Pretty.

455
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:20,485
Who hired you?

456
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:22,192
No one. I just like her.

457
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:24,301
- You're stalking her?
- No.

458
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:26,892
I followed her out
of that bookstore back there.

459
00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:29,572
You are stalking her,
just not for very long.

460
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:33,027
So what else can you tell me
that I might care about?

461
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:36,208
He attends this grief counseling
thing twice a week

462
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,187
where they go around the room
and cry about who's dead.

463
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:42,344
Cameron's been to his house
several times, they...

464
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:45,630
talk about death
and losing loved ones.

465
00:26:58,472 --> 00:27:00,246
What...
What are you...

466
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:04,566
If she turns her head, she's gonna see
that we're walking the wrong direction.

467
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:06,854
No, she won't.
I'm very nondescript.

468
00:27:07,098 --> 00:27:09,446
- I'm not.
- Then you stay four feet behind me.

469
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:11,918
How do you know
what they're talking about?

470
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:14,316
I'm in the same
grief counseling group.

471
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,952
I recently lost my mother.

472
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:19,108
You'd get laid more often
if you told them you lost a kid.

473
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:20,627
I didn't lose a kid.

474
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,250
You're a P.I. who can't lie?

475
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:25,641
I can lie.
I'm just not all that good at it.

476
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:28,352
Dr. Cuddy's been over
to Wilson's twice

477
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:31,370
and phoned a bunch of times.
Foreman called him.

478
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:34,722
And the rest of the time
Wilson's been reading meditation books

479
00:27:34,842 --> 00:27:36,976
and magazines
about restoring barns.

480
00:27:37,478 --> 00:27:38,618
Are you following me?

481
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:40,959
Are you lying?

482
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:44,397
Lesson one:
commit.

483
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:46,404
It's making me uncomfortable.

484
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:47,709
Sorry.

485
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:51,446
You're very pretty.

486
00:27:52,193 --> 00:27:53,523
More uncomfortable.

487
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:55,765
She's not your type.

488
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,188
Your type is much stupider
than her.

489
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,581
- What did Wilson say about me?
- You've never come up.

490
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:05,056
In the grief counseling
or in the other...

491
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:07,712
Anywhere, I got three bugs
in his home and one in his car.

492
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:11,071
If I didn't know you, I wouldn't even
know you existed.

493
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,679
Which is good news.

494
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,137
Only two things you ignore...

495
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:16,992
Things that aren't important
and things you wish weren't important,

496
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,714
and wishing never works.

497
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,614
- She's better.
- I can tell at once.

498
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:37,450
Vomiting's a side effect of the chemo.

499
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,911
Her heart rate's stabilized,
breathing's good.

500
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:42,511
Amylase and triglycerides
are both coming down.

501
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:43,872
I guess it's working.

502
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,311
Can't believe it.
It's cancer.

503
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:48,566
It's not cancer.

504
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,744
Labs show that our patient is healthier.

505
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:05,873
She's gonna get sicker.
Then she's gonna die.

506
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:07,592
I brought thai food.

507
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,537
- What did you see in her?
- Nothing.

508
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:11,855
It's not cancer.
All the tests say it's not cancer.

509
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:14,798
- They've always said it's not cancer.
- Treatment proves it's cancer.

510
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:17,801
Treatment proves it could be cancer.
It's not cancer.

511
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:19,469
This was your diagnosis.

512
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:21,983
- I never thought it was cancer.
- You treated for cancer.

513
00:29:22,103 --> 00:29:23,977
I thought that what
she had acted like cancer.

514
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,268
If it acts like cancer,
maybe it'll respond like cancer.

515
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:27,811
It did.
'cause it's cancer.

516
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:31,859
We have to find something that
walks like cancer, talks like cancer,

517
00:29:32,142 --> 00:29:34,693
tastes like cancer, but isn't cancer.

518
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:35,870
No, we don't.

519
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,448
Better is better.
Who cares why?

520
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,417
I do.

521
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:40,068
And so does tetrault.

522
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:41,208
Who?

523
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:43,035
The dead tuba player.

524
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:44,087
Tibalt.

525
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:47,848
The point is, he died last, but he died.

526
00:29:47,968 --> 00:29:49,499
Which means she's gonna die too.

527
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:51,521
Tibalt wasn't receiving
cancer medication.

528
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,171
There's a cancer drug that's
used off-label for arthritis.

529
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:57,434
- There's no record of arthritis.
- You interviewed all the tuba students?

530
00:29:57,554 --> 00:29:59,425
With pain in his hands,
he can't play.

531
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:02,199
- Then it wasn't in his hands.
- So why do we care about his students?

532
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,635
One of them is canadian.

533
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:06,325
Brought him methotrexate
so he could hide his arthritis.

534
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:08,622
Already couldn't afford his insurance.

535
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:11,188
And that little piece of business
cost me $700.

536
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:13,482
I'll pass it on to
the patient with a steep mark-up.

537
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:15,244
This makes no sense.

538
00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:16,714
I know.

539
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:19,852
She's dead unless we
can find what's cancer...

540
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:22,241
but not cancer.

541
00:30:29,112 --> 00:30:30,595
Something's missing.

542
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:37,922
I need an epiphany.

543
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:43,522
What are you billing out at?
$300 an hour?

544
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,191
Here's four.

545
00:30:45,465 --> 00:30:47,025
There are other oncologists.

546
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,153
Better oncologists.
But I need you.

547
00:30:54,212 --> 00:30:57,311
Let me describe the symptoms,
problems, issues,

548
00:30:57,431 --> 00:30:59,245
and say whatever you feel like saying,

549
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,321
until something triggers
an idea in my head.

550
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:04,174
- That's not the way it works.
- You have a way of thinking things.

551
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:07,605
It's sloppy, it's undisciplined,
it's not very linear.

552
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:08,922
It complements mine.

553
00:31:09,156 --> 00:31:11,498
It drives me down avenues
that I wouldn't otherwise...

554
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:14,214
- Please go away.
- Cancer, but not cancer.

555
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:17,504
Responds to cancer treatment,
but there's no...

556
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:24,498
How are you?

557
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,688
Don't do this.
Please.

558
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,527
Please.

559
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,214
Don't do this.

560
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm trying to move on.

561
00:31:35,257 --> 00:31:36,992
By hanging out with Cameron,

562
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:40,454
talking to Cuddy, Foreman, but not me.

563
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:50,798
I paid a private
investigator to spy on you.

564
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:54,061
You didn't.

565
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:56,677
You wanna move on from me,
you got to deal with me, talk to me.

566
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,179
You had no right...

567
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:01,004
We're not friends anymore.
There's no trust to be breached.

568
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:04,937
I can have you followed,
I can call you names, tell your secrets.

569
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:09,370
Foreman did a CT.

570
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:12,379
Temporal and frontoparietal
regions are normal.

571
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:13,690
Occipital lobe, normal.

572
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,551
I have the right to
walk away from you, House.

573
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:18,799
There's a world beyond you.

574
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:21,758
You need to realize that,
and even if you don't...

575
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:23,581
I'm moving on.

576
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:26,832
The next time you knock,
i'm not answering.

577
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:33,283
Nothing yet.
Keep talking.

578
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,019
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:49,154
You charge me for listening
in on my own conversations?

580
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:51,053
Yeah, why wouldn't i?

581
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:53,667
- How many friends do you have?
- 17.

582
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:55,257
Seriously?

583
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:56,948
You have a list?

584
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:59,771
No, I knew this conversation
was really about you, so I just...

585
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:02,601
gave you an answer so you could get back
to your train of thought.

586
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:04,006
Well done.

587
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:05,914
I have one.
Had one.

588
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:07,248
Friends are important.

589
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:09,186
- You're gonna miss...
- Shut up.

590
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:11,701
Friends allow you to
not sit in a room by yourself.

591
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:14,575
- Are you charging me for this?
- Are we friends?

592
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:15,966
- No.
- Then yes.

593
00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:18,128
Do you wanna be my friend?

594
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,670
No. You scare me a little.

595
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,242
He thinks if he's not a friend,
he can't talk to me. We can talk,

596
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:24,490
- we can be two human beings talking...
- I'm with him.

597
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,903
Didn't mean to interrupt.

598
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:28,131
Yes, you did.
I was in the middle of a sentence.

599
00:33:28,378 --> 00:33:30,938
Yes, I did.
You're repeating yourself.

600
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:32,533
I'm grateful.
Make your point.

601
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:35,267
It's like that "cancer, but not cancer"
thing you were talking about.

602
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:36,653
Friends are friends,

603
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:39,438
customers are customers,
and everything else is everything else.

604
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,821
If it's not, nothing's nothing.

605
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:47,220
And anything can be anything.

606
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,378
10:10. Stop the clock.

607
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:53,413
What?

608
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,308
The world is not as
ugly as she thinks it is.

609
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:04,056
Cancer, but not cancer.

610
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,807
Doesn't make any sense unless...

611
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,480
Brain, but not brain.

612
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:13,263
Occipital lobe's normal.

613
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:15,818
But her eyes suck.
That lobe should be compensating.

614
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:17,014
Since it's not,

615
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:19,953
that tells me that something's in there
that shouldn't be in there.

616
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:21,031
Brain,

617
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:22,825
but not brain.

618
00:34:22,985 --> 00:34:24,257
Why are you in my office?

619
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:27,517
To find the anomaly,
I need to chop off the top of her head.

620
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:29,456
Pretty sure I need
your approval for that.

621
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:32,501
I'm gonna trust your first instinct.

622
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:34,960
I'm not usually confused
when you say things like that.

623
00:34:35,195 --> 00:34:38,340
I'm ordering her cancer
treatment to be continued.

624
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:42,926
Why does it cost $2,300
to fix a coffee machine?

625
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:44,877
Cancer stem cells are real.

626
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,843
They explain everything.

627
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:49,674
They're like embryonic stem cells.
They become whatever they want.

628
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:52,266
Donor had them, the recipients got them.

629
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:54,216
They floated around,
they landed on an organ,

630
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,582
got bathed in cytomes
and partially differentiated.

631
00:34:56,702 --> 00:34:58,350
And the key word there is partially.

632
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,447
In the tuba player,
they became lung, but not lung.

633
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,586
In the tennis player...
Heart, but not heart.

634
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:05,616
Stop me if you've
figured out the pattern.

635
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,235
They looked as if they belonged,
but they weren't doing their jobs.

636
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:10,079
And when they were really needed, boom.

637
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:13,579
Chemo worked because
cells are basically tumors.

638
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:15,043
Chemo shrunk them.

639
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,453
You're still gonna say no, aren't you?

640
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:20,875
You've no proof.

641
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,438
- I have the brain scan.
- The normal brain scan.

642
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,501
This is why I need to take off her head.

643
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:28,369
- To treat or to prove you're right?
- To treat.

644
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:30,839
Chemo's not killing anything.

645
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:33,750
It's just hiding the real problem.
She's gonna crash.

646
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,762
If we wait until she does crash,
it might be too late.

647
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:39,936
So the next step is what?

648
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:42,775
I say no, and then you do something
to make her crash

649
00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:45,187
so that I'll think you've proven
your theory?

650
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:47,744
- I would never do that.
- No, you won't.

651
00:37:55,478 --> 00:37:57,300
You might want to check her I.V.

652
00:37:58,524 --> 00:37:59,575
from here,

653
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,802
it looks like saline instead of chemo.

654
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:05,429
Yeah, they look identical.

655
00:38:05,614 --> 00:38:07,556
Still.
You should probably check.

656
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,144
You switched her meds?

657
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:14,230
How could i?
I had no access.

658
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:17,024
- Close her back up.
- Do the surgery.

659
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:20,111
- There's no reason to...
- No reason not to.

660
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:22,613
The stupidly dangerous
part is already over with.

661
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:24,808
We're ready with the neural net.

662
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:48,297
Is that someone's brain?

663
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:51,209
Except for the part that isn't brain.

664
00:38:57,177 --> 00:38:58,813
Hey, that's the patient I...

665
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:02,027
you said she'd be fine.

666
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:03,696
I'm a better liar than you are.

667
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:05,214
I swapped her meds.

668
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:08,116
I mean, she's got a brain problem.
I coulda killed her.

669
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:11,412
The neural net...

670
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:13,998
will show us how fast
her neurons are firing.

671
00:39:14,183 --> 00:39:16,571
If there's something in the way, say...

672
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,043
brain that's not brain,

673
00:39:18,228 --> 00:39:21,612
the normal neural impulses
will be sucked into a vortex

674
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:23,945
because they're not able
to do their job.

675
00:39:24,317 --> 00:39:27,859
The computer will then process it
and give us a picture of where to cut.

676
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:29,221
Cool.

677
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,320
Excuse me?

678
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,884
Sorry, I thought that's
what you wanted to hear.

679
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,696
You think all this is amazingly cool.

680
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:40,732
And you have no one else,
so you're paying a guy to listen.

681
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:44,469
Sorry... Just trying
to save you some cash.

682
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:46,760
- I'm on the clock.
- Why wouldn't you be?

683
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,158
You think this is interesting to me?

684
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:52,237
I see it.

685
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:54,747
- Can you get it?
- I think so.

686
00:39:55,146 --> 00:39:57,006
Turns out you didn't kill her.

687
00:39:57,637 --> 00:39:58,629
Cool.

688
00:39:59,693 --> 00:40:01,337
You owe me $5,000.

689
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,517
Why are you just standing there,
dr. House?

690
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,563
How'd you know who it is?

691
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:26,746
I can smell you.

692
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:31,075
Like you're a field of roses.

693
00:40:36,598 --> 00:40:37,832
Peppermint tea.

694
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:40,543
You ever hear of the boy who cried wolf?

695
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,580
Never really bought that.

696
00:40:43,145 --> 00:40:45,005
I don't care how often a kid cries

697
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,982
he's being eaten by a wolf,
mom's gonna come running.

698
00:40:52,412 --> 00:40:53,818
The world is ugly.

699
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:56,892
People kill.

700
00:40:57,442 --> 00:40:58,719
They go hungry.

701
00:41:03,522 --> 00:41:04,692
Just proving a point.

702
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:13,325
- People are asses.
- Why are you telling me this stuff?

703
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,059
Because the world is not
as ugly as you think it is.

704
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:19,497
Your transplanted cornea's fine,
your eye is fine,

705
00:41:19,683 --> 00:41:21,682
but your brain wasn't working right.

706
00:41:22,555 --> 00:41:25,224
I'm gonna take the
gauze off your eyes now.

707
00:41:25,757 --> 00:41:27,963
- It's gonna be bright.
- I know.

708
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,217
The brain cells that weren't brain cells

709
00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:33,812
were in the way of processing
visual information correctly.

710
00:41:34,686 --> 00:41:37,557
After the transplant,
you could see, but not see.

711
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:39,893
I could see.
I could read.

712
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,544
Yeah, but it was dull,
or foggy, or gray.

713
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:45,193
I don't know.

714
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,861
What I do know is that you were not
seeing what everyone else was seeing.

715
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,555
And now?

716
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:52,762
Things are gonna be...

717
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:55,618
Beautiful?

718
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:58,311
Things'll be what they are.

719
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:20,513
How do I look?

720
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:26,781
You look sad.

721
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:50,416
Hey.

722
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,513
Is there any way I could put you
on retainer?

723
00:42:54,944 --> 00:42:57,248
