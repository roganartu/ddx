1
00:00:01,916 --> 00:00:03,517
Damn it.
I waited too long.

2
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:04,785
<i>Please, come on,</i>
<i>do something!</i>

3
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:06,120
<i>Come on, do something!</i>
<i>Do something!</i>

4
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:07,221
Couldn't have saved her.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,362
It's your choice
if you wanna go back on drugs.

6
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:19,733
You think
I can fix myself?

7
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:23,437
I just need to know
if you and I can work.

8
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:47,227
Let me see.

9
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,339
It's okay.

10
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,445
It's gonna get infected.

11
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:12,913
Hey, you're not gonna...

12
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,915
You are.

13
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,227
Don't--don't--

14
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:28,695
<i>It's okay.</i>

15
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:31,999
I love you.

16
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:03,490
So now what?

17
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:09,962

19
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:44,197
Everything's good.

20
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:46,833
We don't have to
talk through it all.

21
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,070
No, I meant it
literally.

22
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:52,139
Now what?

23
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:55,008
We could make breakfast.
We could go bowling.

24
00:04:58,146 --> 00:05:00,013
We could stay here.

25
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:05,085
I have to go home
and get dressed

26
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:07,387
and go to work.

27
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:12,526
So that's it?

28
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:18,131
I'm hoping this is
the beginning of it.

29
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,136
Yeah.

30
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,914
Your assistant's new.

31
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:36,183
It's a 50/50 chance
he just...

32
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,452
Can't find
the light switch.

33
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,188
Hello?

34
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,724
Dr. Cuddy?

35
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,192
No, this is
Dr. Cuddy's nanny.

36
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,728
She's, uh, feeling a little
under the weather now,

37
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:49,229
so she won't be
coming in today.

38
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:50,697
Oh. I hope
she's all right.

39
00:05:50,765 --> 00:05:52,099
Would you mind
asking her if--

40
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,367
No. Can't do that.

41
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:55,068
I'm afraid she's locked
in the bathroom.

42
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:57,270
Terrible bug going around.
What's the problem?

43
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:58,538
Well, I'm sorry
to disturb her,

44
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:00,474
but it's Dr. Richardson.

45
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,275
He must have
the same stomach flu.

46
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:03,810
He threw up
in the O.R.,

47
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:06,013
<i>and I'm not sure</i>
<i>how she'd want me to--</i>

48
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,547
hold on a second.

49
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,216
I've talked to Dr. Cuddy,

50
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:11,218
and she would like you
to do three things:

51
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:13,653
One--send him home,
two--sterilize the O.R.,

52
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,622
three--use your own brain.

53
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,125
See ya.

54
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:23,296
It's about puke.

55
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:25,565
That's what's
so important.

56
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:27,634
Puke.

57
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:30,871
Well, I guess I don't
have to rush back in.

58
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:36,276
But whatever "now what"
we do decide on...

59
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:39,079
It comes after
you take a bath.

60
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:43,850
Here's one.

61
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:45,218
"25-year-old man

62
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:47,220
"with numbness
and tingling in his legs

63
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:48,655
and a speech disorder,
three--"

64
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:50,590
anybody see House?

65
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:51,758
It's 10:00 A.M.

66
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,160
I'd be worried
if he was here.

67
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:54,528
"25-year-old"--

68
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:55,929
he was in pretty bad shape
yesterday

69
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:57,497
after his patient died.

70
00:06:57,565 --> 00:06:58,765
<i>House has lost</i>
<i>patients before.</i>

71
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,200
We all have.

72
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:02,035
He's a big boy.
You didn't see him.

73
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:03,670
<i>Best thing</i>
<i>we can do for him now</i>

74
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:05,205
is find him a new
puzzle to solve.

75
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:07,808
Thus bringing us back
to my 25-year-old--

76
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,109
yet you're
the only person here

77
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:10,577
without a potential case
in front of you.

78
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,779
I haven't found
the right one yet.

79
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:14,247
Oh. I-I thought
maybe it was because

80
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:15,715
you were asking for
a leave of absence

81
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,818
and wouldn't have time
to see a case through.

82
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:19,352
I didn't say anything.

83
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,788
He didn't...I saw
an envelope on House's desk

84
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:23,790
with your name on it,
so naturally, I...

85
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:25,225
Steamed it open.

86
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:26,793
What's wrong with you?

87
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,662
You steam an envelope
to keep it secret.

88
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:31,598
Which is why I just ripped it.

89
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,934
You gonna tell us
where you're going?

90
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:41,508
Sure sounds like a no.

91
00:07:43,644 --> 00:07:45,779
There's glass everywhere.

92
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:49,616
Couldn't you have just put
the mirror down nice and gentle?

93
00:07:49,684 --> 00:07:51,418
I was in a mood.

94
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:00,560
I'll be right back.

95
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:02,762
Don't get that.

96
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,064
It could be important.

97
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:06,233
This is important.

98
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:09,903
Right now,
we are more important

99
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:12,072
than what's going on
at the hospital.

100
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,242
<i>So...I say we turn off</i>
<i>our phones</i>

101
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:18,979
and...Give the morning
to us.

102
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:24,251
Okay.

103
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:26,253
I'll go turn it off.

104
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,821
Thank you.

105
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,366
You're distracted.

106
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,334
I'm not.
Yeah, you are.

107
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:43,403
You turned off your phone
but you're still wondering,

108
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:45,138
"what could it have been?

109
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:46,540
"What emergency
will bring down

110
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,008
"the entire hospital

111
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:49,743
if I decided
to take the morning off?"

112
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,578
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:55,382
The clinic is facing reduced
funding from the state.

114
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:59,386
Nurse Jeffrey is filing
his 12th H.R. complaint.

115
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,421
Richardson
is threatening to quit

116
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,757
because he's basically been
a prisoner at the hospital

117
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:05,659
for almost a week.

118
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:07,961
Richardson?
The Neurosurgeon.

119
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,296
He's the only one
I have right now,

120
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:11,198
which means he has to stay
on the premises

121
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:13,099
at all times,
or else the hospital

122
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,001
technically isn't
a level one Trauma Center.

123
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,703
Which means?

124
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,772
I'd have to shut down
the E.R.,

125
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,840
transfer all of the patients
out of the ICU...

126
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:23,043
Okay, stop.
Turn around.

127
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,878
Why?
'Cause you need to relax.

128
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,318
Where are we going?

129
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:34,621
I am going to make you
a magical bath

130
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,523
with a lot of bubbles

131
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:39,960
and eastern spices

132
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:42,128
and blue diamonds,
green clovers...

133
00:09:42,196 --> 00:09:43,930
Transformative powers.

134
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:49,569
But I must have solitude
to focus my creative energies.

135
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,919
Hello?

136
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:07,420
Interesting factoid.

137
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,722
Did you know
that if we don't have

138
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:10,490
a Neurosurgeon
on the premises,

139
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,125
all the puppies in the world

140
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,261
will choke to death
on all the babies?

141
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:15,495
Yeah.

142
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,831
You got a note
from Thirteen.

143
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:21,034
So how come we don't have,
like, five Neurosurgeons?

144
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:24,571
<i>Well, we had three,</i>
<i>but Kapur retired,</i>

145
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,573
and then Nichols just took off
for his daughter's wedding.

146
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:28,008
I've got good news.

147
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:31,878
For the next 16 hours,
you are the new Neurosurgeon.

148
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:35,148
I'm not a Neurosurgeon.

149
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:36,516
Which would matter

150
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:38,385
if you actually had to do
some neurosurgery.

151
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:40,520
<i>House, it's a hospital...</i>
<i>The odds of having to do</i>

152
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:42,122
neurosurgery are higher
than in most places.

153
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:45,225
If an EMT calls in
with a brain or spinal trauma,

154
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:47,360
just divert them
at the nearest hospital.

155
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:48,962
<i>All you gotta do</i>

156
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,997
is stand around
and keep the E.R. open.

157
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:53,066
It's an administrative problem,
not a medical one.

158
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:55,001
House, where
the hell are you?

159
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:57,404
Great. Glad you're on it.

160
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:02,142
All systems go!

161
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:10,150
Why are you going to Rome?

162
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:12,619
I found the flight
information in your locker.

163
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:14,054
<i>I love how everyone</i>

164
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,822
thinks it's so quaint
and childlike of me

165
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,490
to expect a modicum
of privacy around here.

166
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:19,959
Your flight's tomorrow.

167
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,628
What's so urgent in Rome?

168
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:23,096
I hear they want
to tear down the Coliseum

169
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:24,731
to build a karaoke bar.

170
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,067
The Buona Speranza
Medical Center in Rome

171
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,002
is doing
a Huntington's trial.

172
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,537
Seriously, I live to sing.

173
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:32,706
I know that they've been doing
fetal neural transplantation.

174
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:34,140
I also know
that their subjects

175
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,409
have increased risk
of intracranial hemorrhage.

176
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:38,244
This isn't the time
to join a trial.

177
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:39,479
This research
is in its infancy.

178
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:41,448
So's your condition.

179
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:43,350
You read my note.

180
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,251
You go through my locker.

181
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:47,087
And then you decide
you want to round it off

182
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:48,955
by lecturing me
on my life choices?

183
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:51,191
I'm worried about you.

184
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh. Well, that makes it
all right then.

185
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:09,609
So what, exactly,

186
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:10,677
<i>is</i> this?

187
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:12,212
It can still be open
and casual

188
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,280
and fun if you want.

189
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:15,815
Open?

190
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:18,918
You think I want to see
other people?

191
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:22,589
Well, last night
was emotional for you.

192
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:25,592
We both lost that patient.
We watched people die.

193
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,261
I came back here
and I went for the Vicodin,

194
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:31,264
and you...Dumped your fiancÃ©
and you came here.

195
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,466
Which I don't regret.

196
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:35,602
I'm not saying you do.

197
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:38,104
I'm just saying
it was an impulsive move.

198
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:40,440
Don't do this.

199
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:43,009
Why do you have to
analyze things to death?

200
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:45,912
Why can't you just...
Let it be nice?

201
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:50,617
You're right.

202
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:53,153
That was very
anti-secret bath.

203
00:12:58,626 --> 00:12:59,592
House.

204
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,895
Yeah.

205
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,197
The secret bath is...

206
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:07,400
Burning my lady parts.

207
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:12,572
How do you think
my anus feels?

208
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,442
Burning means it's working.

209
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,177
Can we get out now?

210
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,012
I was so waiting
for you to say that.

211
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:24,647
Could I speak to
Dr. Jankowski?

212
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:28,351
No. I don't need
to disturb him in Bermuda.

213
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:30,219
Everything okay?

214
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:32,355
Dr. Cuddy's phone keeps going
directly to voicemail,

215
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:34,057
and I need to get
a Neurosurgeon

216
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,792
to replace Dr. Richardson
for the day

217
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,226
or else she's screwed.

218
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,896
I'm a Neurosurgeon.

219
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:42,031
No. You're not.

220
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:43,900
I've cut into people's
heads more often--

221
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,635
you did a residency
in neurosurgery

222
00:13:45,703 --> 00:13:46,969
<i>at the University</i>
<i>of Melbourne,</i>

223
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:48,471
<i>but you were never</i>
<i>board-certified.</i>

224
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:50,506
You've worked here two days.
How--

225
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:52,575
Dr. Cuddy's first assignment
was for me to get to know

226
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:54,777
everything about
Dr. House's team...

227
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,680
And not to believe anything
any of them told me.

228
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:00,650
I'm...Not
a Neurosurgeon?

229
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,088
And...Voila!

230
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:06,656
The first course,

231
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,959
I flaked some tender
young ears of corn

232
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:13,629
on the side of assorted
exotic breakfast meats

233
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:15,998
in a Chile sauce reduction.

234
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,134
And the...
Second course?

235
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:21,204
A single grape.
To cleanse the palate.

236
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:25,108
Which is kind of a waste,
'cause there is no third course.

237
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:28,311
I'm glad we stayed in.

238
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,313
This is actually...
Pretty good.

239
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:32,915
I can always tell
when you lie.

240
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:36,886
I mean <i>always.</i>

241
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,623
I slept with
my freshman roommate.

242
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,058
A lie.
A truth.

243
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:43,960
You have a tell.
What is it?

244
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:45,995
First admit
that you were lying.

245
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:48,564
Fine. I was lying.

246
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:50,967
My sexual history
is boring and predictable.

247
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:53,069
What is my tell?
Are you kidding?

248
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:54,771
If I tell you your tell,
you'll get rid of it,

249
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:56,072
then I won't be able
to tell.

250
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,874
Well, then you have to
tell me something

251
00:14:57,941 --> 00:14:59,308
I don't already know
about you.

252
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,511
Even though, technically,
you didn't tell me something

253
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:03,045
that I didn't already
know about you.

254
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,782
Quit being so damn logical
and just tell me.

255
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:10,153
I used to have
an intimate relationship

256
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,021
with a photograph of you.

257
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:15,625
Well, actually,
a sock and a photograph.

258
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:16,926
I know.

259
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:19,061
I was lying.

260
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,297
The photo you took of me
as sleeping beauty on Halloween.

261
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:23,199
Why else would you
take that picture?

262
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:27,303
I have to pee.

263
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,441
Ha! You can tell.

264
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:32,942
'Cause actually,
I have to poo.

265
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,684
What?

266
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:45,087
Cuddy's assistant decided
to use his own brain.

267
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:46,789
<i>Who put</i> that <i>idiot idea</i>
<i>into his head?</i>

268
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:49,058
Perhaps you could
follow the same advice.

269
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:52,295
He notified DPH that there's
no Neurosurgeon on the premises.

270
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:55,598
Said he legally had to,
which he legally had to.

271
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,767
Sounds like you got
the situation under control.

272
00:15:57,835 --> 00:15:58,734
<i>No. I don't.</i>

273
00:15:58,802 --> 00:16:00,136
You know I don't.

274
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:02,738
When DPH shows up,
they're gonna shut down our E.R.

275
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:04,774
<i>This can't be fixed.</i>
<i>It is what it is, House.</i>

276
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,242
Great. I've got
every faith

277
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,277
in your ability
to solve the problem.

278
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:15,952
I have called
every Neurosurgeon

279
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,187
within a 45-mile radius--
nothing.

280
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:19,555
I think House
is just testing us.

281
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:20,790
He's always
testing us.

282
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:21,924
Test or not,
it's a problem.

283
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:23,459
It's not our problem.

284
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:24,861
Why the hell is it House's
problem?

285
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:26,229
Where the hell is Cuddy?

286
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:27,930
<i>We either report this,</i>

287
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,866
and half the hospital
gets shut down,

288
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,667
or we cover it up
and run the risk

289
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:33,202
that the entire hospital
gets shut down.

290
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,104
Or we get Richardson.

291
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:36,506
He's sick.

292
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:38,608
And we're doctors.
We get people better.

293
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:41,644
Fing fong fooey?

294
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,348
Ohh...

295
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,385
Can I open them yet?

296
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:51,387
<i>Just a second.</i>

297
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,056
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Hold out your hand.</i>

298
00:16:58,462 --> 00:16:59,862
Oh...

299
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:03,332
I always wanted
to open a bottle of champagne

300
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,101
with one of these things.

301
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:07,737
<i>You might wanna</i>
<i>stand behind me for this.</i>

302
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,073
Okay...

303
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,977
Oh!

304
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:16,913
Yeah!

305
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,815
Mm, I think I might have...

306
00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:21,517
Got that slightly wrong.

307
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,454
Well, good thing
I got a case.

308
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:29,859
<i>House, open up.</i>

309
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:32,228
<i>We need to talk.</i>

310
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:33,462
Just let him in.

311
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,830
No.

312
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:36,299
<i>House!</i>

313
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:38,668
If we just ignore him,
he'll go away.

314
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:41,938
<i>House!</i>

315
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:49,338
I think he finally left.

316
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:51,340
But just in case he hasn't,

317
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:54,309
what can we do that does not
involve talking?

318
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:03,786
You turned on my ringer!

319
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:05,387
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

320
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:07,289
<i>I can hear your</i>
<i>cell phone ringing.</i>

321
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:08,524
Just let him in.

322
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:10,526
No!

323
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:11,994
He's like a stray...

324
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:15,297
He'll eat everything,
shed all over the place,

325
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,699
and crap on the floor.

326
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:20,435
Hi.
This is Gregory House.

327
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:21,804
I can't take your call
at the moment.

328
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:23,172
Please leave a message.

329
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:26,208
If this is Wilson,
I'm fine, not suicidal,

330
00:18:26,276 --> 00:18:27,643
not on drugs,

331
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,179
coping very well with the loss
of my last patient.

332
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:32,614
So feel free to go about
your day without worry.

333
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:34,149
Beep!

334
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:35,751
<i>House...</i>

335
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,387
<i>You can't just</i>
<i>not show up to work.</i>

336
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,322
<i>What's Cuddy gonna say?</i>

337
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,658
If this is still Wilson...

338
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:44,259
She gave me the day off.

339
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:45,627
And tomorrow.

340
00:18:45,695 --> 00:18:47,462
Okay, maybe not tomorrow.

341
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,164
But today.
I'm fine.

342
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:50,933
Now, go away.

343
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,239
Beep!

344
00:18:57,307 --> 00:19:00,008
<i>If you're not in tomorrow,</i>
<i>i'll be back.</i>

345
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:12,688
Look, you're the only
Neurosurgeon we've got.

346
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:15,390
You have to suck it up
and go back to the hospital.

347
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,227
We're not asking you
to operate, just to be there.

348
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:20,462
Unless you can transport
this t-toilet with me,

349
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,464
I'm not leaving
the room.

350
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,032
I'll get a bucket.

351
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,400
You're missing
the point.

352
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:28,370
I ate bad Sushi.
I'm sick. Go away.

353
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:30,172
We can give you promethazine
for the nausea.

354
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,173
Already took it.

355
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:34,209
<i>And trimethobenzamide.</i>

356
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:35,677
Maybe this isn't
food poisoning.

357
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:37,112
Whatever it is,

358
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,214
it must have damaged
the lining of his stomach.

359
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:41,149
<i>Till that heals,</i>
<i>nothing's gonna work.</i>

360
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:43,252
<i>So we need to treat</i>
<i>both that and the nausea.</i>

361
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,153
And whatever's
wrong with him.

362
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:48,156
We give him ondansetron
and prostaglandins.

363
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:49,291
And whatever's wrong
with him.

364
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,792
Neither of those will treat

365
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,394
any possible
underlying condition.

366
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:53,695
Who cares?
He's not our patient.

367
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:55,097
The hospital is.

368
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:56,832
I can...Hear you.

369
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:05,741
You're pretty miserable,
aren't you?

370
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:09,478
Would you be willing
to take a...Fairly risky drug

371
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,880
if it would make it
all go away?

372
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:18,453
Ah!

373
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:28,363
Why didn't you
let him in?

374
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,701
You were
thinking about Wilson

375
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:34,770
while we were having sex?

376
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:37,339
That's so cool!
So was I.

377
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:40,809
You were hiding me
from him.

378
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:42,978
Why?

379
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:45,113
I was not hiding you.

380
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:48,383
I was protecting
your privacy.

381
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:51,086
Wasn't sure if you were
ready to go public

382
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:54,189
with the whole...
"Us" thing yet.

383
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,526
Why would I be
doing all this

384
00:20:57,593 --> 00:20:59,795
if I wanted it to be
private?

385
00:20:59,862 --> 00:21:01,830
Ohh...

386
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:12,274
Oh. I never even asked.

387
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:17,212
Maybe you're not ready yet.

388
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:25,187
Have you read the list
of side effects on those drugs?

389
00:21:25,254 --> 00:21:26,588
We could crash his BP.

390
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,023
I haven't heard a thump,

391
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:29,958
so I assume he's still
quietly puking.

392
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,727
We could be
making him worse.

393
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:32,995
Bigger picture--

394
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:34,730
we're making
the hospital better.

395
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:36,999
We can test for whatever
you want to test him for

396
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:39,334
once he's stable enough
to get back to the hospital.

397
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:42,304
Now, stop being a girl
and move.

398
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:44,906
So you gonna ask me
about this Huntington's trial,

399
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:46,942
and by ask, I mean
give me your opinion?

400
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,710
No.

401
00:21:48,778 --> 00:21:51,079
There is one thing,
though.

402
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:54,783
Will you have sex
with me?

403
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,853
What?

404
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,855
Well, this trial means
you're leaving right away.

405
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:01,289
I was playing
a long game.

406
00:22:01,357 --> 00:22:03,825
Deadlines
have been moved up.

407
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:09,431
Wow.

408
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:11,033
That stuff is good.

409
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,501
Think you can make it
back to the hospital?

410
00:22:12,568 --> 00:22:13,635
Uh-huh.

411
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:15,370
That lamp is shiny.

412
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,608
I mean,
the way it shines is...

413
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:21,977
Shiny.

414
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,412
I take it this is one
of the side effects

415
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:24,913
of the drugs.

416
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:26,615
Who cares?
Let's go.

417
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:36,958
What are you doing?

418
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:38,860
You think I'm afraid
to go public?

419
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,362
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

420
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,863
With a tripod?

421
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:44,766
With a sex tape.
We'll send it to Wilson.

422
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:45,967
It's a win-win.

423
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:47,602
We get to do it again,

424
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,338
and...He might actually
learn something.

425
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:55,210
It sounds like someone's
trying to break in.

426
00:22:57,346 --> 00:22:59,147
It's probably nothing.

427
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:01,083
Stay here.

428
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:13,361
Hey.

429
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:14,896
Stuck?

430
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:16,498
Bummer.

431
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:19,034
Looks painful.

432
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:22,804
Chamomile
or English breakfast?

433
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:25,507
Would you stop
being an ass

434
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:28,310
and pull me out of here?

435
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:30,479
You didn't get
my message earlier?

436
00:23:30,546 --> 00:23:32,914
Yeah. But as someone
once told me,

437
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:34,950
everybody lies.

438
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:36,184
I'm fine.

439
00:23:36,252 --> 00:23:38,720
Just staying home,
chill-laxin'.

440
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:40,122
<i>Your patient died,</i>

441
00:23:40,189 --> 00:23:42,023
you ignore my calls,
and you won't open the door.

442
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:43,725
I don't think you're fine.

443
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:46,495
I think you might be
throwing away a drug-free year.

444
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:48,930
Or...I'm ignoring you
for a different reason.

445
00:23:48,998 --> 00:23:50,765
Sex with my girlfriend.

446
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:54,069
Hmm.

447
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:55,704
Will you please just--

448
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:57,873
please let me in?

449
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:15,023
Thank you.

450
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:17,325
And since when did you
start referring to hookers

451
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:18,727
as girlfriends?

452
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:21,263
She's not a hooker.

453
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,131
What are--wha--

454
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,533
really?

455
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,369
Begins with "C",
ends with uddy.

456
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:31,706
How many Vicodin
have you taken?

457
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:32,908
<i>I'm serious.</i>

458
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:35,043
Cuddy and I
are now Cuddy and I.

459
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:36,978
There's an "I"
in Cuddy.

460
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:38,747
House...It's okay.

461
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:41,750
Almost all addicts
relapse a few times.

462
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:43,752
She's in my bedroom.

463
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:48,056
You're hallucinating,
House.

464
00:24:48,124 --> 00:24:51,059
Honey buns!
We got company.

465
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:08,182
Pupils are normal.
Pulse is normal.

466
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,893
Better than that.

467
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:13,262
They're both
totally awesome.

468
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,465
I'm not on drugs.

469
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:18,301
So...Why did you lie
about Cuddy?

470
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:20,269
To make a point.

471
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:22,438
Probably something to do
with shutting you up.

472
00:25:22,506 --> 00:25:25,308
It's my go-to idea.

473
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:27,477
You do seem okay.

474
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:28,911
You want me to stick around?

475
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,313
I could do my usual thing

476
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:32,415
of pretending I like
watching monster truck rallies,

477
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:33,716
if that would
make you feel better.

478
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,651
No. You go.

479
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:40,156
House...You could have
died.

480
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:42,725
You had a patient
who did die in your arms.

481
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,627
You shouldn't be alone.

482
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:47,330
I know.
That's why I called a hooker.

483
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:49,198
Now, go away.

484
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:52,235
'Cause...
You'll be extra.

485
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,803
Are you really okay?

486
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:56,305
Are you gonna
break in again?

487
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:59,075
You checked my pulse.
You checked my pupils.

488
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:01,677
I'll mail you
the urine sample.

489
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,462
How come I've never
even met you guys?

490
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,564
<i>Y-you're like the greatest...</i>

491
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:22,999
<i>Guys. You know</i>
<i>fluorescent lights</i>

492
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:25,067
flicker at the same frequency
as the human brain?

493
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:27,403
You know the human brain
doesn't flicker?

494
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:29,338
Doesn't take a brain surgeon
to figure out

495
00:26:29,406 --> 00:26:31,707
that he can't perform
brain surgery.

496
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:32,775
What's wrong with him?

497
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,844
High...Blood sugar.

498
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:36,913
He'll be fine as soon
as we rehydrate him.

499
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,014
That's a relief.

500
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:39,215
Thank God.

501
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:40,783
DPH guy will be here
in 20 minutes.

502
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:46,055
What is wrong with him?

503
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:47,256
High blood sugar.

504
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:48,458
You just said so.

505
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,493
Chase is running labs.

506
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:52,228
Right now the top two
contenders are hepatitis

507
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,830
and peptic ulcer disease.

508
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:57,767
So...Is today really
your last day?

509
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:00,102
Flying out tomorrow.

510
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,405
How long a leave
are you taking?

511
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:04,006
Depends.

512
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:05,274
On the drug trial.
Sounds risky.

513
00:27:05,342 --> 00:27:06,375
Yadda, yadda.

514
00:27:06,443 --> 00:27:07,543
You don't think
I should do it.

515
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:08,578
Message heard.

516
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,146
No. I approve.

517
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:12,548
Living fast
and dying young is crap.

518
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:15,218
If you have a chance
to get better...

519
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:18,020
I say good for you.

520
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:22,859
I brought Wilson in here
specifically to go public,

521
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:25,495
just like you requested.

522
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:26,896
I pressured you.

523
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:30,533
Wilson coming through
the window pressured you.

524
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:33,736
If you're forced into this,
it's not gonna work.

525
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,076
Do you have any response
to that?

526
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:47,617
Game on.

527
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:49,485
Is he better?
Yep.

528
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:51,621
You're lying to me
again, aren't you?

529
00:27:51,688 --> 00:27:52,989
Yep.
Then we're screwed.

530
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:54,123
Don't we have
to tell--

531
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:55,591
oh! Damn.

532
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:58,194
Dr. Richardson's
prepping for surgery.

533
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,429
Yeah. I need to talk
to him.

534
00:28:00,497 --> 00:28:02,698
He's prepping for surgery.
So you said.

535
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,268
I just need to confirm
he is who you say he is

536
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:08,070
and that he's
a licensed Neurosurgeon.

537
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:09,739
Well,
here's his paperwork.

538
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:11,173
His hospital I.D.'s
right there.

539
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,075
You can...See it's him.

540
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:14,911
Yeah. I should
still talk to him.

541
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:16,779
They've already scrubbed.
He'd have to be re-sterilized.

542
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,915
The patient's anesthesia
would have to be adjusted.

543
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:21,617
Why did you report
he wasn't here?

544
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:26,489
I must have...
Misunderstood.

545
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:36,832
Oh...Why...

546
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,434
Why...

547
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:39,936
Why is it so...
So hot in there?

548
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:41,337
Oh!

549
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,407
Ahh.

550
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,343
La-dee-dah.

551
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,479
Woodstock, baby.

552
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:51,914
Is he stoned?

553
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,417
No. We're pretty
sure he's got--

554
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,385
oh, I'm sure you have
an explanation,

555
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:57,620
but I don't care.

556
00:28:57,688 --> 00:28:59,989
See, you need to have
a doctor on the premises

557
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:02,058
who can actually do
neurosurgery.

558
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,794
Tell the attending
to divert all ambulances away

559
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:06,295
and start calling
other hospitals

560
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:09,398
and see who can take
your stabilized ICU patients.

561
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:11,167
Those departments
are shutting down.

562
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:16,205
"Design" for five points.
Got it.

563
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:18,975
"Hear."
Got it.
Both versions.

564
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:22,478
"Love."

565
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:24,080
You didn't see love.

566
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:26,015
Wow. I didn't think
you'd take

567
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,951
my lack of board game skills
so personally.

568
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:33,089
Why didn't you tell me
you loved me?

569
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:34,724
Didn't a wise woman
once say--

570
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,026
and by once,
I mean two hours ago--

571
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:38,928
"why do you have to analyze
everything to death?

572
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:40,696
Why can't this
just be nice?"

573
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:42,131
I told you I loved you.

574
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,899
You didn't tell me
you loved me back.

575
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:47,436
You don't think that should
give me cause for concern?

576
00:29:47,504 --> 00:29:48,771
No. 'Cause words
don't matter.

577
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,107
Actions matter.

578
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:53,542
You're really gonna
take a stand here.

579
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,744
You can't say--
nope.

580
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:56,579
Why?

581
00:29:56,647 --> 00:29:58,014
Because...

582
00:29:58,081 --> 00:30:00,316
I forgot to grab a "v."

583
00:30:06,089 --> 00:30:08,057
Lobe.

584
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,692
Gets you one point.

585
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:13,896
One.

586
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:30,939
Labs show he's negative
for everything.

587
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:33,341
I'm guessing at least
one of them is wrong.

588
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:34,910
Who cares?
The E.R. and the ICU

589
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:37,179
are half-empty and the place
is crawling with suits.

590
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:38,413
It's over.

591
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:40,048
You do know we still have
a sick patient here.

592
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:41,750
<i>Right?</i>
<i>He's the guy sitting</i>

593
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:45,053
right behind you,
taking off his clothes again.

594
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:47,222
Uh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

595
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,490
Uh, why don't you
just sit down

596
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:50,158
and take it easy?

597
00:30:50,226 --> 00:30:51,827
He should be coming down
by now.

598
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:54,329
And yet...I'm not.

599
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:56,131
<i>What if his behavior</i>

600
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:58,700
isn't a side effect
of the ondansetron?

601
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:00,802
<i>What if it's a symptom?</i>
Thank you.

602
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,971
<i>What causes delirium</i>
<i>and nausea?</i>

603
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,474
<i>He's been stuck here</i>
<i>in the hospital a few days.</i>

604
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,242
Nobody else is sick,
so it can't be environmental.

605
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,877
Not exactly stuck.
I snuck out.

606
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,647
Freedom is my birthright.

607
00:31:12,715 --> 00:31:14,950
Where did you go?

608
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:17,052
The Seafood Festival at the Convention Center.
<i>We're screwed.</i>

609
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,754
Seafood Festival has stuff
from all around the world

610
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:21,356
<i>in combinations</i>
<i>nobody every thought of.</i>

611
00:31:21,424 --> 00:31:23,024
<i>We could be here</i>
<i>all year.</i>

612
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,559
You had shrimp?
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

613
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:25,794
<i>And crab?</i>
<i>Lobster?</i>
Uh-huh.

614
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:27,496
<i>Uh-huh.</i>
And...

615
00:31:27,563 --> 00:31:30,699
I ate whatever
looked good.

616
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,968
Did you eat any roe?

617
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:35,137
<i>Little tiny eggs?</i>
Nummy!

618
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:38,607
Toad eggs will cause nausea,
and they can get you high.

619
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:41,209
<i>If I'm right,</i>
<i>the antidote is fast-acting.</i>

620
00:31:41,277 --> 00:31:43,178
If we can get him to keep
his clothes on long enough,

621
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:46,681
he can pass
as a functioning Neurosurgeon.

622
00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:52,387
Um...

623
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:53,421
France.

624
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:55,223
And not Paris or the Rivera,

625
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,192
but there's this place
in Normandy.

626
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,261
It's on a...
A tidal island.

627
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:01,463
Everyone who's not staying
in one of the small inns

628
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:03,465
has to leave
before the tide comes in.

629
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:08,203
You have this 900-year-old
fortress all to yourself.

630
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:10,906
It's called...

631
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:13,642
Mont Saint-Michel?

632
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:15,710
That's it.
Have you been there?

633
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:19,014
Nope. But I got a pretty
good idea what it looks like.

634
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:21,183
H-how did you know?

635
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,051
You used to have a picture
of it as a screensaver.

636
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,686
That was years ago.

637
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:26,988
I guess
it's a memorable place.

638
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:29,424
Now, unfortunately, we can't
fly straight to normandy,

639
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:32,194
but the layover in London's
only a couple of hours.

640
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:33,361
What are you talking
about?

641
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,297
It's all there.

642
00:32:35,364 --> 00:32:36,765
All you gotta do
is click confirm,

643
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:37,933
and we're eating croissant

644
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,235
and being insulted
by stinky people

645
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:42,003
this time tomorrow.

646
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:44,573
Don't worry.
I used Wilson's credit card.

647
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,874
I can't.

648
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,943
I'm kidding.

649
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,278
I used your credit card.

650
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:52,380
House...

651
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:53,848
The hospital
does not need your body.

652
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:55,483
I do.
So does my daughter.

653
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:56,885
Well,
she can come too.

654
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:59,688
Or to grandmother's house
she can go.

655
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,757
This is crazy.

656
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:08,763
So...You break off
your engagement,

657
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:11,199
but you won't adjust
your schedule.

658
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,538
I can't.

659
00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:19,407
Not...Tomorrow.

660
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:23,078
But...Two weekends
from now.

661
00:33:23,145 --> 00:33:25,347
If Rachel's gonna
stay with my mom,

662
00:33:25,414 --> 00:33:29,384
I'm gonna need a little
bit of prep time.

663
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:30,619
Okay.

664
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:38,693
What if it doesn't work?

665
00:33:38,761 --> 00:33:39,961
What if I stay this way
forever?

666
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:41,663
The antidote works quickly.
If we're right,

667
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:43,598
you should be back
to your old self in no time.

668
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,133
My old self was boring.

669
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:46,601
<i>Can't we keep the new self?</i>

670
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:48,570
Just lay down,
and stop unbuttoning.

671
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:53,808
I'm sorry
that I read your note

672
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,877
and looked in your locker.

673
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:59,080
You get used to that
kind of thing around here.

674
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:01,416
Do you have anyone going
with you to Rome?

675
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:02,851
Is that your
passive-aggressive way

676
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,319
of asking me
if I'm seeing somebody else?

677
00:34:04,387 --> 00:34:05,520
I hope you are.

678
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:08,390
I mean...I hope
you have someone with you.

679
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:10,091
If I'm scared about this,

680
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,027
I can't imagine
how you must feel.

681
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,229
You shouldn't be alone.

682
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:16,097
If you want...

683
00:34:16,165 --> 00:34:18,133
I could fly over
for a few days.

684
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,902
Friends.

685
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,038
I appreciate that,

686
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,373
but I think I'll be okay.

687
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:27,008
I guess we took
the long way around

688
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:29,077
to being friends, huh?

689
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:35,016
I guess we all did.

690
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:41,956
Thank you.

691
00:34:42,024 --> 00:34:43,525
For everything.

692
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:46,394
You're welcome.

693
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:47,729
For everything.

694
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:52,100
I'll see you tomorrow.

695
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,008
<i>I really do have to leave.</i>

696
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:05,013
I know.

697
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:10,285
What's the problem?

698
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:16,324
This isn't gonna work.

699
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,131
That's it?

700
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,400
You can't just...
Say that and shut up.

701
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:29,302
It's just
a statement of fact.

702
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,672
It's not
a debatable proposition.

703
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,443
Right. Because you can
see the future.

704
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,845
No. But I can see
the past.

705
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:40,313
And you're gonna remember

706
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:43,083
all the horrible things
I've done,

707
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,784
and you're gonna
try to convince yourself

708
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,419
that I've changed.

709
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:48,688
And I'm gonna start doing
those horrible things again,

710
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:51,157
because I haven't changed.

711
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:53,793
Then you'll realize that...

712
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:01,201
I'm an insane choice
for someone who has a kid.

713
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:02,802
And from there,

714
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,738
it's a short step
to the inevitable conclusion

715
00:36:04,805 --> 00:36:08,541
that all of this...

716
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,543
Was a mistake.

717
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:17,016
Tell me any of that
isn't true.

718
00:36:25,426 --> 00:36:27,293
Mercy doesn't have
enough room in their ICU

719
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:28,595
to handle the overflow, so--

720
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:29,963
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

721
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,831
I believe you wanted to talk
to Dr. Richardson,

722
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,833
our Neurosurgeon?

723
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,436
I'm sorry that we met
under such trying circumstances.

724
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:38,972
I hope you restore our rating
as a level one Trauma Center

725
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,974
and reopen the E.R.
and the ICU immediately.

726
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,709
An accidental case
of poisoning.

727
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:44,244
Dr. Richardson
has been treated

728
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,712
and is ready to resume work.

729
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,914
Hmm.

730
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:50,784
Touch your nose
with your index finger

731
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:53,019
and tell me how you treat
a cerebral contusion.

732
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,922
Uh, I-I-I would watch
for edema

733
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,191
and transtentorial
herniation.

734
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:01,761
Good enough.

735
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:03,797
Turn it around.

736
00:37:03,864 --> 00:37:05,832
You're gonna be up late.

737
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,102
Next time...
Avoid responsibility.

738
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,336
Cake?

739
00:37:10,404 --> 00:37:12,105
Taub thought we should
have a little party

740
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:13,807
to see you off properly.

741
00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:15,542
He gets sentimental
about these things.

742
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,510
I never should have
flashed him.

743
00:37:17,578 --> 00:37:20,046
Speaking of which...

744
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,582
Earlier today
I asked you about...

745
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,350
Having sex.

746
00:37:24,418 --> 00:37:25,685
You gave me a look

747
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:28,454
that almost certainly
could only mean no.

748
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:31,591
However, on the other hand,
I'd be remiss if I...

749
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:34,594
Didn't follow up
and confirm.

750
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:36,729
See? It's the same look.

751
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,565
So if it didn't mean no
the first time,

752
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:40,033
then...
No.

753
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,768
No. No, no.

754
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:43,336
No.
Okay.

755
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:44,604
No pressure.

756
00:37:44,672 --> 00:37:46,840
Does that method
ever work?

757
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:50,076
At least once.

758
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:00,987
Mm, I'm, um...
Getting mixed signals.

759
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:03,323
See you at the cake.

760
00:38:06,727 --> 00:38:08,228
The only time
you're afraid

761
00:38:08,295 --> 00:38:11,297
is when you're happy.

762
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:13,333
You just don't
expect it to last.

763
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,002
'Cause it doesn't.

764
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,004
You don't know that.

765
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,775
I've done
horrible things to you.

766
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:27,313
And I'll do horrible
things again to you.

767
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:29,415
But because of one
stupid moment

768
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:33,353
with a dying girl
and a pile of rubble...

769
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,188
You think I can change.

770
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,293
Tell me where I'm wrong.

771
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:46,900
I don't want you
to change.

772
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:50,103
I know
you're screwed up.

773
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,906
I know you are always
gonna be screwed up.

774
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:55,909
But you're the most
incredible man I've ever known.

775
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,082
You are always gonna be...

776
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,552
The most incredible man
I have ever known.

777
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:11,457
So unless you're
breaking up with me,

778
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:13,960
I am going home now.

779
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,675
I love you.

780
00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:33,212
âª Oh, yeah, and later on âª

781
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,415
âª we took a southbound train âª

782
00:39:35,482 --> 00:39:38,818
âª yeah, and it was cold out âª

783
00:39:38,886 --> 00:39:40,653
âª yeah, it was freezing
down rain âª

784
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:43,323
âª yeah, and it'll let up âª

785
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,457
âª if we all screamed
for the change âª

786
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:46,359
where's Thirteen?

787
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:48,528
I don't think
she's coming.

788
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,030
What's going on?

789
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:53,466
She's not going to Rome.

790
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,201
You mean
she changed her mind?

791
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:56,369
I called
the hospital in Rome

792
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:57,437
to see when she was
schedule for surgery.

793
00:39:57,504 --> 00:39:59,405
Why would you--
<i>doesn't matter.</i>

794
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:02,575
Point is, she's not
even in the trial.

795
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:05,511
Never heard of her.

796
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,915
She's been lying to us
all day.

797
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:10,350
Well, have you tried--

798
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:13,052
<i>both her phone lines</i>
<i>have been disconnected.</i>

799
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,122
She's just gone.

800
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,660
âª No, no,
just the good days âª

801
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:23,363
âª yeah, yeah,
just the good days âª

802
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,865
it's gonna be great.

803
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:27,867
Yeah.

804
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:29,535
âª Just the good days âª

805
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:37,377
âª âª
