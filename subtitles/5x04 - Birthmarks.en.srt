1
00:00:04,323 --> 00:00:05,599
Do you see them anywhere?

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,554
Why don't we go back to their house,
wait for them there.

3
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:09,519
Yeah,

4
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:13,479
'cause they'll probably answer
the door the sixteenth time I knock.

5
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:23,147
There they are.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,162
Hi. I'm sorry I followed you here.

7
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:31,701
I just really wish you could
give me a few minutes of your time.

8
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,285
**Chinese language**

9
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:36,873
I know you would never agree
to make it an open adoption,

10
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:38,977
but I just figured
maybe you never had a choice.

11
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:40,750
I mean, it's china, right?

12
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:42,587
**Chinese language**

13
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:44,532
**Chinese language**

14
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:51,054
- What did he say?
- He wants you to leave them alone.

15
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:55,958
Please...

16
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:57,427
**Chinese language**

17
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:59,233
I just want ten minutes.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,224
Learn what you're like,
tell you about my life.

19
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:05,402
**Chinese language**

20
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:07,922
**Chinese language**

21
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:15,127
He said they have no daughter.

22
00:01:17,017 --> 00:01:19,003
I am sorry you wasted a trip.

23
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:21,960
I know that's them.

24
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:26,744
How does that work?

25
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:32,750
How do I pray?

26
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,379
You make a wish and lift the buddha.

27
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:44,026
I wish they could understand
how badly I need this.

28
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,870
Now make the wish again.

29
00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:00,165
If you cannot lift the buddha
this time, your wish will be granted.

30
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:14,848
Are you okay?

31
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:22,039
**Chinese language**

32
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,818
House - Season 05 Episode 04
"Birthmarks"

33
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:35,303
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak

34
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:54,219
www.house-fr.com

35
00:02:58,085 --> 00:03:00,338
I picked cameron's pocket
down in E.R.

36
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,518
I came up a doozy.

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,977
Your mother called, twice.

38
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:04,752
She's still healthy.

39
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:07,106
This 25-year-old woman,
on the other hand...

40
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,900
Her messages
sounded kind of urgent.

41
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,654
Well, that's the way women sound
when their spouse of 50 years dies.

42
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:18,187
Your dad died?

43
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:20,036
- Are you...
- Yep. Fine!

44
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:21,401
Our patient,

45
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,392
who's been known to take
a few drinks on non-occasions,

46
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:27,085
vomits blood and collapses
on a trip to china.

47
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:30,237
Chinese surgeons
cut out a foot of bowel,

48
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:32,195
but the pain is worse now
than it was before.

49
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:33,800
House, call your mom.

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,260
What are you, my mom?

51
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:38,388
We can continue
this differential in five minutes.

52
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:40,269
Are those bags under your eyes?

53
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:41,933
You were up all night.

54
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:45,201
- You told her, didn't you?
- I don't know

55
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:48,147
what your daddy issues are,
but don't deflect them on me.

56
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:50,398
Told his wife
he's been getting some strange.

57
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:52,944
She kicked
his adulterous tuchus to the curb.

58
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:55,481
- Seriously, you told her?
- Yes, I told her.

59
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,282
But no,
she did not kick me to the curb.

60
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:59,819
We stayed up late talking.
We're going to continue talking.

61
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,370
Much like House should be doing
with his mother right now.

62
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:04,330
Anybody read chinese?

63
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,918
Otherwise, we have no idea
what these doctors did to her.

64
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,960
Kutner, you're sort of asian, right?

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,374
Get it translated.

66
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:12,643
What about meckel's diverticulum?

67
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,854
If the surgeons
didn't remove the diverticulum,

68
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:16,384
it can cause pain, bleeding.

69
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,888
Too high up for a colonoscopy.
CT could Miss it.

70
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,171
Ultrasound's fastest.

71
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,099
And since I'm fastest
with the ultrasound...

72
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,548
House, let me do the ultrasound.

73
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:27,312
You need to deal
with your dad and...

74
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:30,095
I'm not deflecting because
I'm avoiding something deep.

75
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,817
I'm deflecting because
i'm avoiding something shallow.

76
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:34,768
Seriously, I'm fine.

77
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:36,820
I didn't even like the man.

78
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:41,937
No meckel's.

79
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:44,913
Were you there for the rice
or the reeducation camps?

80
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:47,624
I was there to track down
my biological parents.

81
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:50,956
Like a salmon returning
to the stream where it was born.

82
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:53,971
Did you become whole again,
or did you get eaten by bears?

83
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:55,582
They denied my existence.

84
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:02,634
Four parents, and not one of them
taught you to cover your mouth.

85
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:03,718
Oh, my god!

86
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:05,642
You look like they cut you in half.

87
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,179
- Doctor, we're her parents.
- I'm just a technician.

88
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:11,566
Her doctors will be by later.
You can schmooze then.

89
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,294
Can you let them know that we,

90
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,483
we went by her apartment
and collected all her medication.

91
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,614
I'm a technician and a doctor.

92
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:22,283
- You went through my apartment?
- We found alcohol.

93
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,410
We thought you'd quit.

94
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:27,167
- Did her drinking cause this?
- No.

95
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,124
Can you tell her it did?

96
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:39,768
Licorice root.

97
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:42,931
No, thanks I'm good.

98
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,348
I threw it to you for a reason.

99
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:48,139
That's what
the chinese doctors gave her.

100
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:50,007
It contains glycyrrhizin.

101
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:52,480
They were treating her for sars?

102
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:54,609
Not very effectively.

103
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:59,031
But sars explains the cough,
causes hypoperfusion,

104
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,036
which explain ischemic balance,
it's perfect.

105
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:02,824
Lung involvement isn't very severe.

106
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:05,203
Okay, well, so call it "ars."

107
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,954
Start her on ribavirin
and interferon.

108
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:18,923
- Sorry about your father.
- I'm not.

109
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,677
Are we done emoting now?

110
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:24,578
If there's anything
I can do, just...

111
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:27,306
You know, you're right.
I don't think I can sleep alone tonight.

112
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:32,437
And you can tell me that
that is liquid vicodin.

113
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:35,606
We giving I.G. shots to everyone
who came in contact with your patient.

114
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:39,906
Shockingly, none of the nurses
volunteered to administer yours.

115
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:43,260
It goes better in a large muscle.

116
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:45,397
Drop your pants.

117
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:48,953
You know, I usually pay
tens of dollars to hear that.

118
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:57,701
The funeral's tomorrow.

119
00:06:57,821 --> 00:06:59,041
My mom called you?

120
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:01,886
There is 3:40 flight out of Newark.

121
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,719
If you leave now,
you can be in Lexington tonight.

122
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:07,701
Your mother wants
you to deliver a eulogy.

123
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,681
"Eulogy."

124
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:11,184
From the greek for "good word."

125
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:14,313
Now, if she asked me
to deliver a bastardogy,

126
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,564
- I'd be happy to...
- Then be a grown-up.

127
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:20,401
Call your mother back and
tell her that you're sick with grief,

128
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,237
- but you're too busy to be there.
- She knows when I'm lying.

129
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,073
Then start writing.

130
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,333
They yanked my brother
and sister of college.

131
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:38,461
Can you please tell them
I'm not dying?

132
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:39,814
You have sars.

133
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:41,203
I'm wearing a mask.

134
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:42,362
It's a big deal.

135
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:43,591
Cut 'em some slack.

136
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:45,714
But I am gonna be okay, right?

137
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,568
That's what all this stuff is for.

138
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:49,880
We're gonna need the names
and numbs of everyone

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,929
you came in contact
with here and in china.

140
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:53,359
Flight numbers, dates...

141
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,433
that doctor
that i coughed all over...

142
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:56,771
Is he gonna be all right?

143
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:58,470
So far he's fine.

144
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:14,000
It's back.
This is where the pain all started.

145
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:17,776
She's tachycardic.
Get a crash cart in here!

146
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,341
What's going on?

147
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,846
I need to know what's going on.
That's my daughter.

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,083
Her liver's failing.
It's not sars.

149
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:52,245
I am not doing this because I care.

150
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:03,721
Cuddy drugged me.

151
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:05,677
She...

152
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,720
My mom didn't call cuddy.

153
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:12,471
She called you.

154
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:17,484
I knew you couldn't stay away
I knew you loved me too much.

155
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:19,064
I'm doing this for your mom.

156
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,762
I'm not doing this at all.

157
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:22,394
If there were something to be done,

158
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:24,507
I would have done it
in the year he spent dying.

159
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,641
You took my vicodin?!

160
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,531
I'm in pain.

161
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:39,110
One?!

162
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:43,711
So the vicodin is my leash.

163
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,672
One'll take the edge off,

164
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,716
but it won't give me enough relief
for an escape back to plainsboro.

165
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,475
Where's my phone?

166
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,990
That's the team.
It's their ring tone.

167
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,505
Forget it.

168
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,526
The patient's blood
is on your hands.

169
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:15,711
House? You there?

170
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:18,014
I'being held against my will.
Call the police!

171
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,870
Nicole had a clot
in the epatic vein.

172
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,578
Chase sucked it out,
saved her liver.

173
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:24,315
No signs of a tumor or venous
malformations. Nothing that could...

174
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,320
- She's an addict.
- Drugs and alcohol wouldn't

175
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,514
She's a smoker.

176
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:30,006
Combine smoking with any one
of a dozen genetic disorders,

177
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,484
and she's a clotting machine.

178
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:34,727
Multiple blood clots would tie together
bowel ischemia, lungs, and the liver.

179
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,812
We need to pinpoint
which defect she has

180
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:38,888
so we can start her
on the right anticoagulant.

181
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:39,945
Draw her blood,

182
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:42,687
let's find out which genetic gift
her genetic parents gave her.

183
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:46,093
Thanks for calling.

184
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,958
My ring tone for you
is "dancing queen", by ABBA.

185
00:10:58,508 --> 00:10:59,392
Nicole?

186
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:05,323
I need to pee.
Pull over at the next stop.

187
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:11,988
I'll just pee on the floor.

188
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:16,470
You bought used floor mats?

189
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,854
That is brilliant.

190
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:23,352
There's a rest stop in five miles.

191
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:39,644
- Cane.
- The restroom's right there.

192
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,337
You can make it on your own.

193
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:48,711
I suppose I could talk about the summer
he decided he wasn't speaking to me.

194
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,380
Two months, not one word.

195
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:56,093
Anything he wanted to say, he typed up
and slipped under my bedroom door.

196
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,930
You don't want to say anything,
don't say anything, but go.

197
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:02,975
Tell your mom you're sad for her.

198
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:04,852
Just by being there, i'd be lying.

199
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,400
She wants to think,

200
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,855
for a moment,
that she had a happy family.

201
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:10,800
So give her a gift, lie!

202
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,258
Give me my cane...

203
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,988
I'll go to the damn funeral.

204
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,806
I said I'd go to the funeral.
I didn't say when.

205
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:47,978
We have these two categories:
inside and outside.

206
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,219
Patients stay inside.

207
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,773
Then, when they're better,
we let them go outside.

208
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:54,075
Thanks.

209
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:55,945
But they don't let you smoke inside.

210
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:59,740
So why don't you go back there
and give me five minutes outside?

211
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,139
Make a fist.

212
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,265
It's such a beautiful day, we thought
we'd do all our doctorg outside.

213
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:24,203
People stare at me any time
I'm out with my family.

214
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:26,109
It's like a puzzle.

215
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:28,153
"Which one of these things
doesn't belong?"

216
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:29,853
Belonging's overrated.

217
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,842
I was adopted by a white family
when I was nine.

218
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:35,942
I like being different.

219
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:38,737
The view's better
from the outside looking in.

220
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:45,932
Must be easier to be different
when you're a success.

221
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,031
Is that a problem?

222
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:51,667
This is why we prefer inside.

223
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:04,484
You actually keep a flashlight

224
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:06,608
that doesn't need batteries
in the trunk?

225
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:09,615
Next to the jacket,
emergency water,

226
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,697
nail clippers, tooth brush,
space blanket...

227
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:16,295
When things go wrong,
I like to be ready.

228
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,583
Will you... please hold the flashlight
for a minute?

229
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:34,470
You know, those aren't
just my car keys.

230
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,568
My house keys are on there too.

231
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:38,396
Amber gave me that key chain.

232
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,016
No, she didn't. Not unless
your pet name for her was "Volvo."

233
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:54,979
A man who would lie about a gift
from a dead girlfriend...

234
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,192
Is probably responding to a childish,
pointless act of petulance.

235
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:03,197
The struggle to resist most captures
is never pointless.

236
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:05,014
Vive la resistance!

237
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:09,065
I hate to break it to you, che,
but simple delay won't work.

238
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:12,141
Your mother will hold
the funeral till we get there.

239
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:15,694
My father was a punctual man,

240
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,401
beholden to time.

241
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:20,463
Two minutes late for dinner,
you didn't eat.

242
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:24,218
My mother would never disrespect him
by starting the funeral late.

243
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,857
Yeah, you clearly have
no issues to work through.

244
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,493
Come on, forget the keys.
Call a locksmith.

245
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:35,855
We go inside and play "guess that smell"
with the truckers while we're waiting.

246
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:37,690
Join me on the dark side.

247
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,896
The dark side's done, House.

248
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:45,002
I'm delivering you to your mother,
and that's it.

249
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:47,852
I have moved on.

250
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:53,596
What do you think House would send,

251
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:57,595
the "gentle comfort" arrangement
or the "warm thoughts" bouquet?

252
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,587
I mean, if he wasn't an ass.

253
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,312
Send one of those giant cookies
shaped like a coffin.

254
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,885
His mom would believe
it was from him.

255
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,929
I didn't tell you
so you could send anything.

256
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:12,507
You need to know the extent to which he
is disconnected from the human race.

257
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:14,875
Took a six-pack of FFP
to stop the oozing.

258
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:16,312
She's bleeding and clotting?

259
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:19,397
Plus schistocytes on her smear means
it's DIC, which means she's got cancer.

260
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,984
- She's young. It could be leukemia.
- Normal WBC makes that less likely.

261
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,996
- The belly pain toward a G.I. Tumor.
- House did an ultrasound.

262
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:28,657
He wasn't looking for a tumor.
Go run a CT.

263
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,242
I don't buy it.

264
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:32,996
Ct can find small intestinal cancers

265
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,539
- that an ultrasound...
- I don't buy House.

266
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:40,074
When my father died, I wound up
killing a patient. And I hated the man.

267
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:42,651
Whatever House says
or doesn't say,

268
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:44,708
I'm sure the guy's a mess.

269
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:49,186
So he was a bastard.
He was still your father.

270
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:52,530
You're biologically programmed
to have feelings for him.

271
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:54,043
No, I'm not.

272
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:56,630
Feelings aren't rational.

273
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,291
I know you have trouble with anything
that can't be quantified and counted.

274
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:02,441
He's not my biological father.

275
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,397
I figured it out when I was 12.

276
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:12,163
Of course. You were a brilliant,
socially isolated 12-year-old,

277
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:15,330
and you create a parallel universe
in which your life doesn't suck.

278
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:17,242
I look at the facts.

279
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,717
First of all, he was deployed
on training exercises off Okinawa

280
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:23,721
during the time
I had to be conceived.

281
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:27,463
And since you're 150 years old,
air travel was impossible.

282
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,496
His second toe is longer
than his big toe.

283
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,638
- Mine isn't.
- This is sad.

284
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:35,139
You don't believe
your mother screwed around...

285
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:37,630
I have a distinctive
red birthmark on my scalp

286
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,145
that matches a certain friend
of the family.

287
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,649
If you believed this story, you wouldn't
tell me about his birthmarks.

288
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:46,206
You'd be telling me
about the genetic testing you had done.

289
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,700
And since you haven't mentioned it,
obviously, you didn't do it.

290
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,029
Because you don't want...
What are you doing?

291
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:54,034
Get your... get off the...
There's a cop!

292
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,641
Nicole, lie still.
This'll only take a few seconds.

293
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:09,924
One millimeter cut
through upper abdomen.

294
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,678
She was adopted when the parents
thought they couldn't have kids.

295
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:16,480
Then they had three more. She took
the message as "thanks for playing,

296
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,225
but we have our real children now."

297
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:20,686
And the real children
probably think they're accidents

298
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:23,647
while she was hand-picked. Everybody's
got problems with their parents.

299
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:26,024
She's an addict.
Something went wrong.

300
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:29,622
And it has to be the parents?
Magnifying pancreas.

301
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,804
- I'm not saying the parents screwed up.
- You're saying you like her.

302
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:35,962
So you don't want her faults
to be her fault.

303
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,522
But they're someone's fault,
and the other people you know are...

304
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:44,168
I think we may need
to call House again.

305
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:48,271
You lost track of your speed?

306
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:51,535
I think that was Hitler's excuse.

307
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,884
Lost track of the Jews.

308
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:55,429
No one held him
responsible.

309
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,282
- I'm not playing house.
- You were protecting me.

310
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:01,396
Anybody in their right mind
would have ratted me out.

311
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,521
I'm just trying
to speed things along.

312
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,706
You are going
this funeral.

313
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,409
Make it fast. I don't want to miss
the anal cavity search.

314
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:19,532
Looks like a mass
in the pancreas.

315
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:21,288
Not to me. This is radio.

316
00:19:21,449 --> 00:19:24,374
- And I want a full play-by-play.
- It's fluid-filled.

317
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:26,335
Would you get out of the car, sir?

318
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:28,958
Officer, if you want to give me
a ticket, I totally understand.

319
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,188
- Just get out of the car, sir.
- Cyst?

320
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:33,509
Large cyst.
Something going on there?

321
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:35,010
Wilson's getting arrested.

322
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,224
How large?

323
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,597
SUV sized, or mid-range sedan?

324
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,057
Seriously?
What'd you do?

325
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,142
I'm obviously joking.

326
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:45,109
If Wilson was getting handcuffed
on the hood of his car,

327
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:47,033
Would I be carrying
on a differential?

328
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,149
Diameter is at least
eight centimeters.

329
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:53,009
- Is it in the tail or in the head?
- The head.

330
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:55,113
You too, sir.
Out of the car.

331
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,609
We've got a construction site.

332
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,831
A steamroller is plowing...

333
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:01,970
Out now.

334
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:07,763
No can

335
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,430
James Evan Wilson,

336
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,725
there's a warrant
for your arrest in Louisiana.

337
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,053
What are the traits
of a steamroller?

338
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:36,630
Powerful.
Maybe pancreatic cancer.

339
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,662
Great idea, except the only symptom

340
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:41,216
it matches up with
is being steamrollerish.

341
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:43,012
You don't think House
is onto something?

342
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:44,746
I think he thought he had an idea.

343
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:47,416
I also think his metaphors
are tough enough to decipher

344
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:48,955
after he's said them.

345
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,795
- We need to focus on the medicine.
- No answer.

346
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,631
There's not gonna be an answer.
They've been arrested.

347
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:57,698
- He was joking.
- He reacted to the size and location.

348
00:20:57,818 --> 00:21:00,595
That's what we should be
focusing on. Not playing mad libs

349
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:03,940
while our patient's exploding noun
destroys her life-sustaining noun.

350
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,583
I'll try to get Wilson on the line.

351
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:09,104
What if it's not how a steamroller
works, but what it does?

352
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,856
Clears things.

353
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,901
This is a waste of time.

354
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,277
I need that phone call.

355
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:28,559
I'm a doctor, and when someone tries
to call you three times,

356
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,294
it's code for "pick up the damn phone
before someone dies."

357
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:34,546
I'm sure there's
other smart doctors.

358
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,644
You'd be surprised.

359
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:40,576
- You told me you'd taken care of this.
- I did.

360
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:44,484
- First words you ever said to me.
- I took care of it.

361
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:47,564
You must've screwed up somehow.

362
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,085
Sir?

363
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:53,357
Not to hurry you,
but we need to be at a funeral...

364
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:57,128
Nobody is going anywhere
or taking any phone calls

365
00:21:57,248 --> 00:21:59,195
till I hear back
from Louisiana.

366
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:01,234
It's a really old warrant.

367
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,700
Isn't there a statute of limitations
on this kind of thing?

368
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,827
It's suspended
when you flee the state.

369
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:09,331
I didn't flee the state.
I left the state.

370
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:12,834
Because I don't live in the state.
And the charges were

371
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:15,921
just so minor...

372
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:17,561
"vandalism,

373
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,000
"destruction of property,
assault."

374
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,403
There is a simple explanation.

375
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:24,816
There was a medical convention
in New Orleans...

376
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:26,807
You don't need to explain to me.

377
00:22:26,968 --> 00:22:29,906
I was fresh out of med school.
I didn't know anybody at the convention.

378
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:32,813
You heard the man, Wilson.
You don't have to explain.

379
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:34,731
I am not gonna sit here wasting time

380
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:37,631
just so you can avoid
your father's funeral!

381
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:41,350
He's my father.

382
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:45,534
- I have the right to avoid his funeral.
- Not if your mother's alive, you don't.

383
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:50,334
Explain.

384
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,296
Did House react
to the eight centimeters?

385
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,619
He whistled.

386
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,399
It's huge.
Anyone would think so.

387
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,965
He doesn't whistle because he's
impressed. He wasn't expecting it.

388
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,551
It means he changed his mind
at that point.

389
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:04,302
A single super-sized cyst

390
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:07,055
ruled out a diffuse process
like scleroderma or lupus.

391
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:10,523
Rule out diffuse process, you're stuck
with a process only affecting pancreas.

392
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:12,811
Gallstones
or pancreatic divisum.

393
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:14,823
What he asked next
would narrowed that down.

394
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:16,073
He asked the location.

395
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:18,106
Heads it's gallstones,
tails it's divisum.

396
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,179
It's at the head.
She's got gallstones.

397
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:23,671
- The steamroller means potholes...
- Relax. We got it.

398
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,907
You figured out
she's got gallstones?

399
00:23:28,862 --> 00:23:32,453
I was at the hotel bar
trying to unwind, have a drink.

400
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:35,374
There was this guy
who kept playing

401
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:39,504
Billy Joel's leave a tender
moment alone on the jukebox.

402
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:43,467
- Leave a tender moment is a good song.
- It's a great song. He was out of line.

403
00:23:43,628 --> 00:23:46,057
Not as good as scenes
from an Italian restaurant or...

404
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:50,218
So I... I asked the man
to stop, polity.

405
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,059
You yelled politely.

406
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:54,358
I was polite
the first couple of times,

407
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:57,481
but courtesy made
no impression on this ass.

408
00:23:57,981 --> 00:23:58,788
So

409
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,360
I threw a bottle
into the mirror,

410
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:05,841
which successfully conveyed
my message.

411
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:08,792
And smashed a ten-foot
antique mirror.

412
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:12,245
And set an example to two other patrons
who threw shot glasses.

413
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:14,806
I had nothing to do
with that fight.

414
00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:18,610
The assault charge was totally bogus.
And I paid for the mirror.

415
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:21,588
I think I have the picture.

416
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:25,066
I assume you're the guy
who was playing the song.

417
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,385
No, I was the guy
who bailed him out.

418
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:30,200
That's how we met.
I was in jail.

419
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:33,391
This guy was a total stranger to you,
and you bailed him out?

420
00:24:33,857 --> 00:24:37,104
It was a boring convention.
I had to have somebody to drink with.

421
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:40,129
And there's the foundation
of our entire friendship.

422
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:43,944
If you hadn't been bored
one weekend, it wouldn't even exist.

423
00:24:44,104 --> 00:24:45,968
There were 3,000 people
at that convention.

424
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:48,240
You were the one who wasn't boring.
That says something.

425
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,960
It also says that you lied to me
about getting the charges dropped!

426
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,759
I got a lawyer.
He cut a deal.

427
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:54,139
You didn't call the guy?

428
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,414
You've to go at the arraignment.
Everybody knows that.

429
00:24:56,574 --> 00:24:58,959
Everybody with
your misdemeanor experience.

430
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,252
You can go.

431
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,382
What?

432
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,596
He's a fugitive from justice.

433
00:25:05,215 --> 00:25:07,527
That whole story was lies.
He stabbed a man.

434
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:10,220
Louisiana doesn't want to pay

435
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,430
- to get you back.
- Forget louisiana.

436
00:25:12,824 --> 00:25:16,309
He was driving recklessly
through your comatose village.

437
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,854
Do the put lead
in the jelly doughnuts here?

438
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:20,931
Stop acting
like such an ingrate

439
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,462
and go pay your respects
to your father.

440
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:27,706
The CT confirmed gallstones.

441
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:30,873
Normally not dangerous.
Almost everyone has them.

442
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:33,660
- But sometimes...
- They kill you?

443
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:37,858
Unless I take 'em out.
We do it laproscopically.

444
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:47,677
- How long has her urine been brown?
- Kidney's were fine this afternoon.

445
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:49,134
They're not now.

446
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:52,596
It's not the gallstones.

447
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:58,727
Well, of course it's not gallstones.
Who thought it was gallstones?

448
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:01,980
- You said "steamroller."
- I also said "construction site."

449
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,646
Gallstones could cause
a pancreatic cyst.

450
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:06,234
Just turn around.

451
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,210
The thing is two hours over already,

452
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,304
and that's the third time
we passed that colonial

453
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:12,490
with the cross burning out front.

454
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:13,809
I'm not lost.

455
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:17,954
I'm not talking about what caused
the cyst, but what the cyst caused.

456
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:19,033
Everything.

457
00:26:19,153 --> 00:26:20,999
Cysts are symptoms, not diagnoses.

458
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:24,419
Unless it's a multiple cyst,
with connections to other organs...

459
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:25,879
Like a steamroller.

460
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:28,131
That's a long road
down to the kidneys.

461
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,634
How do we prove it?
Won't be visible in a scan.

462
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,595
Chase isn't gonna go groping around
when she's got kidney failure.

463
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:36,181
- Bubbles.
- Is that your new stripper name?

464
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:39,757
Yes. And also, we inject bubbles
into the cyst and foll where they drift.

465
00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:42,844
If they end up in other organs, we know
you're right, cut it out, she's fine.

466
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:44,980
Bubbles is right.
Go echo.

467
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,354
I'm not lost.

468
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:08,045
Nicole, you gotta stay still.

469
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:09,255
I'm nervous.

470
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:12,133
- You're not nervous.
- It's the DTS, isn't it?

471
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:17,179
I haven't had a drink
since I got here.

472
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,258
Good heavens,
we haven't missed it after all.

473
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:24,770
It's like the end
of Christmas carol.

474
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:38,609
I'm so glad you're here.

475
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,731
Oh, it's a load
off of my mind just to see you.

476
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,545
- Thank you, James.
- Mom, how could you delay the funeral?

477
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:51,955
Honey, your dad is dead.
He's not going to care.

478
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:54,225
Do you know what
you're going to say?

479
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:55,525
I don't know.

480
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:58,325
Just let the minister
orne of his buddies from the corps...

481
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:01,474
You're talking. I don't care
that you didn't like him.

482
00:28:01,824 --> 00:28:04,519
He was your father,
and he loved you.

483
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:06,712
The war is over, greg.

484
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:09,774
Please do this for me.

485
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:14,738
Stop looking so worried.

486
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:18,631
I know he's gonna make me proud.

487
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:21,953
I'm sure you know him
better than I do.

488
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,673
Her liver's been compromised.

489
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:33,506
And the dts will cause her muscles to
continue to twitch, even under sedation.

490
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,796
We need to paralyze
her to do this procedure.

491
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,260
I wanted to stop.

492
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:39,262
A phenarbital coma will not only

493
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:41,889
allow us to inject the cyst,
I'll treat the dts.

494
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:44,309
When she wakes up,
she won't be in withdrawal.

495
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:47,258
We've seen her through
withdrawal before.

496
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:49,545
We've seen her through everything.

497
00:28:49,665 --> 00:28:50,565
We've been...

498
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:52,983
supportive, we've been combative.

499
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:55,274
We've picked her up from
bars in the middle of the night.

500
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:56,988
We've let her spend the night in jail.

501
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:02,327
I used to say it'd be okay.

502
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,329
That I'd get it together.

503
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:06,572
I don't say that anymore.

504
00:29:08,878 --> 00:29:10,322
Let's make you healthy.

505
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,587
Then we'll worry
about making you sober.

506
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:17,422
The lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want...

507
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,283
I am not talking.

508
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:23,849
We were strangers who shared
some geography 30 years ago.

509
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:27,106
Right, he had no
influence on you at all.

510
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:29,736
The father who was
compulsive about punctuality.

511
00:29:29,856 --> 00:29:30,886
His issue.

512
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,108
Which I deliberately
made not my issue.

513
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:35,068
Thereby making it your issue.

514
00:29:35,228 --> 00:29:39,572
Compulsively showing up four hours late,
ignoring discipline, ignoring rules.

515
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,595
Oh, god, he's here.

516
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:43,243
Who's here?

517
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,533
The one
you're pretending is your father?

518
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:50,490
Nice pick.
He looks like Sean Connery.

519
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:53,846
So back when you were devising
this fantasy,

520
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,257
did you tell your father:

521
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,714
"dad, I refuse to recognize

522
00:29:56,874 --> 00:30:00,802
your existence because
I have chosen james bond as my dad"?

523
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:04,013
I used different words.

524
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:06,141
What?!

525
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:10,011
Hearing your own son
hates you so much

526
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:12,099
he's replaced you in his mind?

527
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,412
That's gotta suck.
How did he take it?

528
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,231
I already told you.

529
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:20,146
He didn't speak to me for a summer.

530
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:29,850
It means more to me than...

531
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,084
Than I can say to have
all of you here today.

532
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,102
And now, our son Gregory

533
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:40,550
would like to say a few words.

534
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:45,799
Greg?

535
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:05,783
There's a lot of people here today.

536
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:08,884
Including some from the corps.

537
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:12,533
And I notice that every one of them

538
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:14,792
is either my father rank or higher.

539
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,493
And that doesn't surprise me.

540
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:23,269
Because if the test of a man

541
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,449
is how he treats those
he has power over,

542
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:30,308
it was a test my father failed.

543
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:37,023
This man
you're eager to pay homage to,

544
00:31:37,738 --> 00:31:39,771
he was incapable of admitting

545
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:41,653
any point of view but his own.

546
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,031
He punished failure,

547
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:46,915
and he did not accept
anything less than...

548
00:31:58,664 --> 00:32:00,371
He loved doing what he did.

549
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:04,744
He saw his work as some kind of...

550
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:07,466
Sacred calling.

551
00:32:09,076 --> 00:32:11,432
More important than
any personal relationship.

552
00:32:16,342 --> 00:32:18,940
Maybe if he'd been a better father,
I'd be a better son.

553
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,176
But I am what I am because of him...

554
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:26,906
For better or for worse.

555
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:31,152
And I just...

556
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,664
I just wish...

557
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:10,682
Put it back.

558
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:13,060
He's not gonna miss it.

559
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,392
I'm done enabling.

560
00:33:14,512 --> 00:33:16,369
You can't even let them put
him in the ground

561
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:18,180
without making it serve your agenda?

562
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:20,688
You real want to do
this in front of everybody?

563
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:22,364
You wanna punish me or them?

564
00:33:35,738 --> 00:33:38,088
How can I still feel surprise?

565
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:40,618
You would take,
even this, a moment of

566
00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:43,274
real human grief,
and turn it into a farce.

567
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:45,200
Oh, cut the crap.

568
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:47,042
You enjoy what I do.

569
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,656
I never had to force you.
You like coming along for the ride.

570
00:33:49,857 --> 00:33:53,077
- Yes, that's why i'm cheering you on...
- This is about you needing

571
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,035
to be prepared for the worst.

572
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:57,163
So you become an oncologist.

573
00:33:57,323 --> 00:33:59,457
No surprises there.
Worst happens all the time.

574
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:03,544
But Amber, she was young and healthy.
Her death came out of nowhere.

575
00:34:03,704 --> 00:34:05,088
Don't bring Amber into this.

576
00:34:05,248 --> 00:34:06,607
And you weren't ready.

577
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:07,883
That makes you angry.

578
00:34:08,003 --> 00:34:10,275
The world sucks, and
you didn't have time to brace yourself.

579
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:12,632
What happened out there
is your show!

580
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:15,007
You're scared to death
of losing anyone that matters.

581
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:17,163
So you dump the person
who matters the most to you!

582
00:34:17,283 --> 00:34:19,477
I'm not scared to death.
I'm moving forward!

583
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:22,355
Because no one can take away
from you what you no longer have.

584
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:25,400
Your father's death is about you.

585
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,949
Amber's death is about you.

586
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:29,286
I can'imagine why someone
wouldn't want to be your friend!

587
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:32,630
Admit it, you're angry and
you're scared of losing me.

588
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,758
I'm not angry,

589
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:35,239
- I'm not scared.
- Admit it.

590
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,723
- I'm not afraid.
- Admit it.

591
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:38,985
- I've lost people. It happens.
- Admit it. Admit it!

592
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:40,173
What are you, five?

593
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:42,073
- Stop repeating...
- Admit it. Admit it.

594
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:43,793
Admit it. Admit it.
Admit it.

595
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:45,623
Come on, admit it.
Admit it!

596
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:52,965
Still not boring.

597
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:58,158
Did you know I was gonna do that?

598
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,332
Because I didn't know
I was gonna do that.

599
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:02,270
I know
you have trouble losing people.

600
00:35:03,654 --> 00:35:07,475
In new orleans, I saw you carrying this
express package around the conference.

601
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:11,154
And you wouldn't let it go,
but you wouldn't open it.

602
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:14,333
So I peeked at the return address.

603
00:35:14,453 --> 00:35:15,695
Diamond, fairbairn.

604
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,696
Divorce attorneys.

605
00:35:18,306 --> 00:35:20,273
Your first wife had
just served you with papers.

606
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:22,665
Did you know that
when you bailed me out?

607
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:24,141
Were you...

608
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:25,835
Doing something nice for me?

609
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:28,463
What did I say about being boring?

610
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:31,627
We owe your mom an apology.

611
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:35,361
Hello?

612
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,460
It's House.

613
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,890
How'd the bubble test go?

614
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,475
The problem wasn't the cyst.
It's advanced dilated cardiomyopathy.

615
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:43,513
We did a three-dimensional echo.
Showed a mass in the left atrium.

616
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:45,313
Looks like an atrial maxoma,

617
00:35:45,473 --> 00:35:48,775
but the ultrasound images are
a little grainy, so it's hard to tell.

618
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:49,901
House

619
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:51,819
The images aren't grainy.

620
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:53,296
They sure look grainy.

621
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:55,698
I've seen pictures of
you where you look tall.

622
00:35:56,082 --> 00:35:57,200
It's iron overload.

623
00:35:57,596 --> 00:35:59,660
Creates speckles on the image,
makes it look grainy.

624
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,704
Also makes her pancreas fail,
her blood clot, and her intestine...

625
00:36:02,824 --> 00:36:04,248
Atrial myxoma is more likely.

626
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:05,666
MRI for a better view.

627
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:07,668
Call me back and tell me
you're embarrassed

628
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:10,622
because my eyesight
is better 500 miles away.

629
00:36:11,313 --> 00:36:12,868
I need a phone number.

630
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:22,828
I'm a doctor in new jersey,
treating one of your clients.

631
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:25,515
A young woman looking
for her biological parents.

632
00:36:25,635 --> 00:36:29,205
You know, you could just wait for
the MRI to have your cursity satisfied.

633
00:36:30,343 --> 00:36:33,807
What person who is nothing
like me are you saying that to?

634
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:37,173
Did the parents look tan?

635
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:40,363
The disease she has is genetic,
which means they should have it too.

636
00:36:40,483 --> 00:36:42,286
They don't look more
tan than anyone else.

637
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:44,194
- Discolored teeth?
- They're farmers...

638
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:46,209
The village
doesn't even have a dentist.

639
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:48,200
Right. Thanks.

640
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:50,044
But if it matters,

641
00:36:50,204 --> 00:36:52,039
I'm not convinced
they were her parents.

642
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:52,923
Why not?

643
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:54,799
Because they said
they have no daughter.

644
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,175
The man was adamant,

645
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:58,366
and the woman seemed confused
and frightened.

646
00:36:58,486 --> 00:36:59,486
Thank you.

647
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,567
Differential.

648
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:06,605
Say
you're a middle-aged chinese woman...

649
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:07,991
fine.

650
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:08,896
Say it.

651
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:11,015
I'm a middle-aged chinese woman.

652
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:14,443
Girl comes to you,
says that she's your long-lost daughter.

653
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:16,106
Why would yo be frightened?

654
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:19,906
I'm frightened
because she's a threat?

655
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:22,178
Maybe she knows something?

656
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:24,495
She hasn't seen you
since she was an infant.

657
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,806
Maybe an inheritance issue.

658
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:28,167
They're peasants.

659
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,357
Her very presence is a threat.

660
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,251
She--

661
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,458
What year was she born?

662
00:37:35,692 --> 00:37:36,876
'83.

663
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:38,593
She's not supposed be alive.

664
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:43,139
China introduced the
one-child policy in 1979.

665
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,511
Say they didn't want a girl.

666
00:37:45,926 --> 00:37:48,644
- They tried to kill her.
- Maybe the baby doesn't die.

667
00:37:48,804 --> 00:37:51,062
Maybe the father panics
or regrets it.

668
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:53,011
Takes the baby to an orphanage.

669
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,911
Maybe he doesn't tell his wife.

670
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:58,696
Who freaks out like she's seen a ghost
25 years later when the girl shows up.

671
00:37:58,856 --> 00:38:01,479
Why does attempted murder
from 25 years ago

672
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,409
suddenly become relevant
to her health now?

673
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:05,628
Maybe they gave her something toxic.

674
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:07,455
It would have to be fat soluble.

675
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:12,627
This is fun, isn't it?

676
00:38:20,051 --> 00:38:22,386
- Let me see the MRI.
- We don't have one.

677
00:38:22,546 --> 00:38:24,607
She started vomiting as
soon as we started the scan.

678
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:27,850
Then let her vomit through the MRI.
That's what nurses are for.

679
00:38:29,312 --> 00:38:32,279
Her parents tried to kill her.

680
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,106
I don't know how,

681
00:38:34,383 --> 00:38:38,157
but I know it caused her to get sick
25 years later trying to lift a buddha.

682
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,686
Explain.

683
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:43,491
I already had this conversation
with Wilson--just go with it.

684
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:46,285
- Poison?
- Buddha wouldn't make it worse.

685
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:48,404
Maybe the weight stressed
her back, which...

686
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:50,873
makes sense if she's never
lifted anything in her life.

687
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:53,834
She actually didn't get sick till
she tried lifting it that second time.

688
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:56,259
I'm guessing the weight changed.

689
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:01,707
Anybody have Taub's pager number?

690
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:02,927
What's up?

691
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:04,909
Maybe give him a call.

692
00:39:05,363 --> 00:39:07,901
If he tosses that switch on the MRI,
she's dead.

693
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:09,854
X-ray her brain.

694
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:13,857
Pins.

695
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:16,652
Push them rough the soft fontanelle
of an infant,

696
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:20,338
you skewer the brain, and the hair hides
the entry wounds.

697
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:21,817
It's the perfect crime.

698
00:39:21,937 --> 00:39:23,580
She's had them
in her all these years.

699
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,534
- What changed at the temple?
- Same thing that changed in the MRI.

700
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:29,444
Shockingly,
not all religious leaders are honest.

701
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:31,092
I'm guessing these particular monks

702
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:34,069
are bilking the faithful by pushing
a magnet up buddha's butt.

703
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:35,767
There's another one under the table

704
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:38,133
that'll repel or attract, depending
on how you shift them.

705
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:39,690
When she picked up that magnet,

706
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,883
it moved one of the pins deeper into the
sympathetic nervous center of her brain.

707
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:44,677
This sent a signal
through the nerves

708
00:39:44,837 --> 00:39:46,812
to the blood vessels in
her small intestines,

709
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:48,651
which caused the symptoms in china

710
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:51,392
and in the giant magnet
we call an MRI.

711
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:53,009
She's lucky.

712
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,616
We're all screwed up by our parents.

713
00:39:56,736 --> 00:39:58,618
She's got documentation.

714
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,258
The pins will be removed surgically,
and she'll be fine.

715
00:40:05,378 --> 00:40:07,935
We'll wake her from the
coma after the operation.

716
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:10,745
Is there any way
you could not tell her?

717
00:40:11,482 --> 00:40:12,538
Please.

718
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:14,032
She's fragile.

719
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:17,842
She desperately wanted
to know her biological parents.

720
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,296
For her to find out
that they wanted her dead...

721
00:40:21,694 --> 00:40:23,257
I don't know what that'll do to her.

722
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:25,689
She may not be as fragile
as you think.

723
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:27,011
We know our daughter.

724
00:40:28,908 --> 00:40:30,181
See this pin here?

725
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:33,655
It's been pressing directly
on her addiction center.

726
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,065
It's not her fault.

727
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:37,073
And it's definitely not your fault.

728
00:40:37,193 --> 00:40:38,939
She's not who you think she is.

729
00:40:56,282 --> 00:40:59,085
I hear
your patient's gonna be all right.

730
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:02,835
Is that why you're here?

731
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:06,107
A colleague checking up
on a patient?

732
00:41:08,027 --> 00:41:09,521
Something going' on?

733
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:11,858
I'm celebrating.

734
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:21,774
My mom hated him too.

735
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:26,695
Your DNA test showed no match?
That's incredible.

736
00:41:26,855 --> 00:41:28,239
At the age of 12,

737
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:31,520
you actually figured out
your father wasn't your birth father

738
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:34,315
that's what you wanted, wasn't it?

739
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,887
Why should it depress you?

740
00:41:37,007 --> 00:41:38,461
It doesn't depress me.

741
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:40,668
Doesn't make any difference at all.

742
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:42,678
That's what depresses me.

743
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:51,554
I guess nobody gets
to choose who their parents are.

744
00:41:53,854 --> 00:41:57,715
I'm not even sure anymore if
we get to choose who our friends are.

745
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,527
I spoke with Cuddy.
She hasn't filled my position yet.

746
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,708
If you're coming back

747
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:13,314
just because you're attracted
to the shine of my neediness...

748
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,871
i'd be okay with that.

749
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:22,710
I'm coming back
because you're right.

750
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,835
That strange,
annoying trip we just took

751
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:30,050
was the most fun I've had
since Amber died.

752
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,109
You hungry?

753
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:52,907
My dad's dead.

754
00:42:54,507 --> 00:42:55,511
Yeah.

755
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,620
My sympathies.

756
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:11,521
