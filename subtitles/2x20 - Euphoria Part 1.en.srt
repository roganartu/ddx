36
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:49,848
You read what he wrote
in the margin?

37
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:53,764
"Our friend Lazarus sleeps,
but I go that I may wake him up."

38
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:56,001
Yeah. He's not proud of me.
He's proud of Jesus.

- He's a cop.

Good point.
How about... drugs?

45
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:18,213
Tox screen was clean.
He did, however, get hit by a bullet.

46
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:20,959
- Just mentioning it.
- He was shot?

47
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:22,830
No, somebody threw it at him.

48
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,744
I'm thinking trauma.
He's got bullet fragments
lodged in his brain.

49
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:28,929
According to Baby Shoes,
the cop was laughing before he got shot.

50
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:32,005
- Baby Shoes?
- Guy who shot him.
- Reliable witness.

51
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,842
His name is Baby Shoes.

52
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:35,503
How bad can he be?

53
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,306
Fragments are in the wrong part
of the brain to cause euphoria.

54
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,785
So let's expand the search.
Factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs.

55
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:44,778
Why are we ignoring
the elevated heart rate?

56
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:45,874
'Cause he's in shock.

57
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:48,052
What if the heart was
already fast before he got shot?

58
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:49,819
You mean after the foot race?

59
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:52,657
He's giddy.
Indicates a blockage of oxygen.

60
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,979
Carbon monoxide gas would elevate
the heart rate and cause coughing
and impair neurological functions.

61
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:59,188
He got CO poisoning outdoors?

62
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,477
Yeah. All 'cause those bastards
didn't ratify *Kyoto.
(*Kyoto Protocol on global warming)

63
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:10,063
Or he got CO poisoning indoors and
moved outdoors before he'd inhaled
enough to make him drop dead.

64
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:11,764
Test his arterial blood gas.

65
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:16,651
If his carboxy hemoglobin levels
are higher than 15%,
stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.

66
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,401
You go check the cop car
for gas leaks or--

67
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:22,426
If it was the cop car,
his partner would be sick.

68
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,877
Well, maybe she is.
She just doesn't have
as good a sense of humor.

if you could do me a favor.

I don't think I need
to test for anything.

119

Nope, waste of time.

120
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,023

about the marijuana?

121
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,153
I've heard rumors
since junior high.

122
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:19,433
The cop's acting high
because he is high.

123
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:21,778
- He's got--
- Legionnaires' Disease.

124
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:23,433
It's a good thing Joe got shot.

125

- Takes 48 hours to test for Legionnaire's.

127

And only two seconds to recognize
if the symptoms fit while staring at
the rancid, unchanged water of an AC unit.

128
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:38,060
Marijuana explains the high carboxy,
the cloudy lungs, and the happiness.

129
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,760
Pot doesn't explain the fact
that he's gotten worse
since he was admitted.

130

Why don't we agree to disagree?

131
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:46,455
Actually, why don't we agree
that you'll disagree with me
while treating him for Legionnaire's?

132
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:48,408
It's not as pithy, but...

133
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,051
I feel a lot better.

134
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:52,664
The meds are working.

135
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:57,161

COHP levels are down. No fever.

You seem disappointed.

138

I'm glad you're feeling better.

139
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:08,248
- You got a problemwith cops?
- Please don't talk.

140
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:11,353
In my experience,
people who just don't like cops
have a reason--

141
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:13,291
I need you not to talk.

142
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:17,518

they're the infiltrates we found yesterday.

- Not there anymore?
- They're clearing up.

145
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:28,305
You had Legionnaire's.
Now you don't.

146
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:31,905
So you didn't, um...
You didn't find anything at my place?

147
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:37,614
Nothing... medically relevant.

148
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:40,988
So there's, uh... There's nothing
I need to worry about, then?

149
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:42,732
Not this time.

150
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,262
Whatcha doing?

151
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:50,571
I want to make sure
he sees what's involved.

152
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:55,428
What we found was fairly advanced.
These cloudy areas here, and here.

153
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,396
These parts of your lungs
simply weren't functioning.

154
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,315
They're okay now, right?

155
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:05,750
Everything's okay now?

156
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,854
I'm fine.

157
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:22,811
You're blind.

158
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,180
I bumped into something.
That doesn't mean I can't see.

159
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:30,120
- I'm sure it's frightening,
but you only think--
- What's Dr. Cameron wearing?

160
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:34,714
Dark blue pants,
white shirt.

161
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,174
- Black shoes.
- Ooh, almost.

162
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:39,286
Except for the pants,
shirt, and shoes.

163
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:40,959
You're blind.

164
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,492
Chase:
He really thinks he can see?

165
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,997
He can physically see.
His brain just can't process it.

166
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,110
No chance this is
a practical joke?

167
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:53,420
No way.
Anton's Blindness indicates
damage to both occipital lobes.

168
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:54,505
Must be from the trauma.

169
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:57,966
Bullet fragments just happen
to hit the same spot in both lobes?

170
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,123
Stroke could cause
Anton's Blindness and euphoria.

00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:05,684
Office Krupke
is clotting in his brain.

172

Start heparin to thin the blood,
find the clot, and yank it out.

173
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:11,989
Clot would be at the top of
the bilateral vertebral arteries.

174
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:15,587
Great. Chase...
stick your fingers in there,
grope around till you find it.

175
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:20,316
Oh,  wait...
When you turn him into a vegetable,
then there's gonna be frivolous lawsuits.

176
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:23,806
You know what would be better?
Contrast MRI.

177
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:26,015
- Do we have one of those?
- You can't do an MRI.

178
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,957
If the bullet fragment's magnetic,
they'll move and rip his brain apart.

179
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,953
Well, let's flip a coin.
Heads, MRI; tails, he dies.

180
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:36,891
The police issue Kevlar vests don't have
the ceramic plate insert that would
shatter a bullet, they would just catch it.

181
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:38,154
So the bullet shattered on its own.

182
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:40,993
Meaning Baby Shoes was
using .38 caliber hollow points.

183
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,894
Which, unfortunately,
are ferromagnetic.

184
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:50,640
It's just so cool you know that.

185
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,921
We could do an angio
to find the clotting.

186
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:54,352
Waste of time.

187
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,566
The skull creates too much artifact.
We'll never get a decent view.

188
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,062
- Next best thing to an MRI.
- And a waste of time.

189
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,649
- Angio might show--
- Oh, God, it's a coup!

190
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:07,951
Fine! Go do your angio.
When you're done wasting your time,
meet me down in the morgue.

191
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:16,497
We're going to snake a catheter in
your femoral artery and up into your brain
so we can check for clots.

192
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,098
Keep this on
throughout the procedure.

193
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:22,120
Unless the pot's
already made you sterile.

194
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:24,653
I have a stressful job.
You got no idea.

195
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,428
I grew up with cops like you.

196
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:29,069
One part bully,
nine parts hypocrite.

197
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:38,294
Cameron:
What is wrong with you?

198
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:39,472
Just having some fun.

199
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:42,137
- That man is sick and scared.
- The man's a crooked cop.

200
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,931
Maybe you should take yourself
off the case, Foreman.

201
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,347
Don't have to like
someone to be their doctor.

202
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,190
[On intercom]
<i>Hey, how you doing there, buddy?</i>

203
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:53,164
<i>Just sit still and we'll have you back out there
scaring the crap out of people in no time.</i>

204
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,544
Happy?

205
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:59,800
House:
What did the angio tell us?

206
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:01,440
What are you looking for?

207
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,531
I called my mom.
She didn't pick up.

208
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,824
What did the angio tell us?

209
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:08,906
That Foreman should
be off this case.

210
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,235
House:
He's a neurologist.

211
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,041
Unless you think the patient's
optic nerve is in his spleen...

212
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,805
He doesn't like cops.

213
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,159
Foreman,
policemen are our friends.

214
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:18,926
If you and I ever
get separated shopping--

215
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,825
I was just
busting the guy's chops.

216
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:23,302
See? He was just
busting the guy's chops.

217
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,539
Foreman is essential
to solving this case.

218
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:27,703
Medically,
what did the angio tell us?

219
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:30,554
Appears to be some clotting,
possibly around the circle of Willis.

220
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:32,740
Based on the progression of symptoms,

221
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,045
the clot is growing.
We need to cut into--

222
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:39,321
Saying there appears to be clotting is
like saying there's a traffic jam ahead.

223
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:43,496
Is it a 10-car pileup or just
a really slow bus in the center lane?

224
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:47,637
And if it is a bus,
is it a thrombotic bus
or an embolic bus?

225
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,050
Think  I pushed
that metaphor too far.

226
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,371
Angio can't tell us
that kind of information.

227
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,023
Oh, so you're saying
it's just a waste of time.

228
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:56,769
It gave us some information
without killing him.

229
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:58,682
You don't know that
an MRI will kill him.

230
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:00,441
The bullets have a ferrous base!

231
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:03,512
Little tiny pieces trapped in his head.
They're not going anywhere.

232
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:06,409
Maybe it's worth attempting
surgery to remove the fragments.

233
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:10,831
Surgeons say inoperable,
or the patient's on blood thinners.
Other than that, perfect planning.

234
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:12,173
You got a better plan?

235
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:13,481
M uch.

236
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,587
[Bang!]

237
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:23,481
Bullets identical to the one
that Baby Shoes popped Joe with.

238
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,290
Let's see how magnetic it is.

239
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:26,885
Did anybody hear a--

240
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:31,004
I shot him.
He's dead.

241
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:39,889
The bullet split into four fragments,
no exit wounds.

242
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:42,343
Only used a half load of gunpowder.

243
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:46,328
We won't be exactly precise
comparing the locationon
an X-ray to an MRI.

244
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,621
How unprofessional
was Foreman?

245
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:51,690
As him yourself.
He's right here.

246
00:14:51,753 --> 00:14:53,923
Cameron:
Worse than usual.
Better than you.

247
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:56,379
He berated Joe
for being a bad cop.

248
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,115
Berated or humiliated?

249
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,926
I'm not sure. I didn't have
my thesaurus with me.

250
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,342
One implies that
he took pleasure in it.

251
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,982
I wanna know if
it was repressed black anger
or just giddiness.

252
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:10,644
Whoa! Whoa.
You think I'm sick?

253
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:16,470
I think that an appropriate response
to watching your boss shoot a corpse
is not to grin foolishly.

254
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,853
But the fact that I've grown
bored by your insanity
is proof of nothing.

255
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:24,723
[On intercom] Dr. Foreman,
<i>Dr. Chase requests your assistance.</i>

256
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:32,295
I can't even imagine
the backwards logic you used
to rationalize shooting a corpse.

257
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:34,946
Well, if I'd shot a live person,
there's a lot more paperwork.

258
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,892
Then it won't be a problem for you to stand
beside the casket at the wake and explain why
a cancer patient has a bullet hole in his head?

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,028
The man donated
his body to science.

260
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:43,256
Yes, it's a tragedy.

261
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,115
If I hadn't shot him, his body
could have spent the next year letting
first-year med students use the carpool lane.

262
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,045
He's set.

263
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:50,630
Do not turn that on, House.

264
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:52,617
You're mad because
I put a bullet in his head.

265
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:55,324
At worst,
all I'm doing now is taking it out.

266
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,383
My bad.

267
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:21,469
Ahem.

268
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:25,817
They have to, uh,
shut down the magnet to fix it.

269
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:29,692
MRI is gonna be out of commission
for at least two weeks.

270
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:34,932
Well, it doesn't matter.
We obviously can't use it
on this patient.

271
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:39,296
No... But there are other doctors
in this hospital, and other patients.

272
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:42,442
That helps explain how they can
afford all the fancy equipment.

273
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:44,037
I'm sure
I'm pulling my weight.

274
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,832
Is doing nothing an option?

275
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:52,445
I'm just saying.
Maybe the clot will break up on its own.
The giddiness seems to have gone away.

276
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:53,861
The blindness hasn't.

277
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,178
Echo his heart.

278
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,771
Looking for what?
The problem is
obviously neurological.

279
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,525
The clots are in his brain.
The source of the clots may not be.

280
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:02,879
Do a complete
transthoratic echocardiogram.

281
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:06,081
Maybe we get lucky.
Maybe the clots are
coming from his heart.

282
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:13,222
Chase:
Heart's clean.

283
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:14,470
Where else can we look?

284
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,993
We could ultrasound his legs,
look for a DVT.

285
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,621
I need you to move over.

286
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:21,766
Joe? You okay?
[Alarms starts beeping]

287
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:24,371
Tachycardia.
Heart rate 150 and rising.

288
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:26,612
- Saline wide open.
- He's bleeding out.

289
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:29,183
House wanted to thin his blood.
Sure did a good job.

290
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,143
BP's crashing.
He's going into shock.

291
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:33,814
Intracranial bleeding.
We need to relieve the pressure.

292
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:35,348
We need a surgical team.

293
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,656
[Laughing]

294
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:40,047
Foreman, get out!

295
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:43,536
Boy, is he screwed!
We clot his blood, he dies.

296
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:46,940
We thin it, he dies.
[Laughs]

297
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:50,321
Am I the only one
who finds this funny?

298
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:55,772
[Cacks]

299
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:57,183
Oh, man.

300
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,633
I'm not sick!

301
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:07,139
Did you hear the one about
the guy who bled into his brain

302
00:18:07,223 --> 00:18:10,437
and had to have a hole drilled
in his skull to relieve the pressure?

303
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:13,498
- Hilarious!
- Someone laughs, they're dying?

304
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:16,043
- That's absurd.
- But not funny.

305
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:20,713
If I'm not sick, all you're doing is
locking meup with the source.
I'll get sick, prove you right.

306
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:23,518
If you're not sick,
it's not contagious.
You've got nothing to worry about.

307
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,433
If you are sick,
the two of you are staying in here
until we find out why.

308
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,455
So you might want to
make friends with the pig.

309
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,439
Good news is
I can finally get my MRI.

310
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,643
No, you can't! [Laughing]
You blew up the machine!

311
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:37,425
Not the portable one,
Chuckles.

312
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:42,452
Chase and Cameron are bringing it
to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.

313
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,002
Wh-where are you going?

314
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:46,621
To the office.
Got work to do.

315
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:51,297
Eat your meals.
Take your temperature every half hour
and any meds I command you to take.

316
00:18:51,402 --> 00:18:53,293
So I'm just a regular patient now?

317
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,156
No.

318
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,586
You get your own thermometer.

319
00:18:58,202 --> 00:19:00,195
[Chuckles]

320
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,279
Check your blood.

321
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:13,020
Anyone with an elevated sed rate
gets to be Foreman's new roomie.

322
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,443
- He should be a part of this.
- He's a patient.

323
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,297
- He's not irrational.
- He's not objective.

324
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:19,663
He's got the most motivation
to get this diagnosed.

325
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:22,218
Right,
you're not even friends with him.
Why would you care?

326
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:27,204
There's an area of
increased T2 attenuation
in the cingulate cortex.

327
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:28,741
Kind of...mushy.

328
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,150
Cingulate cortex
controls emotions.

329
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:35,232
This mushy spot explains the euphoria.
Question is, what's causing the mush?

330
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:37,962
Question you might want to ask
a neurologist.

331
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,942
Foreman is a selfish jerk,
but he's a neurologist,

332
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,746
and he's the only one
who's been in that apartment.

333
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:44,851
This is why he shouldn't be here.

334
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,929
You wouldn't call him a jerk
if he was here.

335
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:50,007
If you think
he screwed up at that apartment,
you'd keep it to yourself.

336
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:52,123
- No, I--
- Well, we'll never know.

337
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:55,630
But as long as he's not here,
he's just like any other patient.

338
00:19:55,714 --> 00:19:58,086
Which means we can
dump on him all we want.

339
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:01,454
What's eating
the selfish jerk's brain?

340
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,761
West Nile or
Eastern equine encephalitis--

341
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,473
Test Foreman's blood.

342
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:07,378
Given that he's
the only one who got it,

343
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:12,993
person-to-person transmission is
less likely than some sort of deadly toxin
Foreman picked up at the guy's home.

344
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:15,763
Who wants to go next?

345
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,142
Whoa.

346
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:29,297
You're ready to sacrifice yourself
for a guy who doesn't consider you a friend.

347
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,371
He's just a patient, right?

348
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,036
It's the job.

349
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:34,262
Hey...

350
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:37,084
You don't have to go anywhere.

351
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:39,976
Joe's apartment is
right downstairs in the lab.

352
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,475
Foreman brought back
samples of everything.

353
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:44,485
What was that,
"Who wants to go next?"

354
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,473
Some kind of... test?

355
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:48,026
Don't worry.
You made the right call.

356
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:51,136
Foreman stumbled into
whatever it is without knowing.

357
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:53,281
He's way smarter than you are.

358
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,005
Ow!

359
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:15,014
Damn, Chase!

360
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:16,681
[Laughing]
You suck at this.

361
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:18,771
<i>Sorry, it's this damn suit.</i>

362
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:21,372
I can do it myself.
And I'll throw that out.

363
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:25,776
What'd the MRI show?

364
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:31,161
I can't be a part of the differential, and
I can't even know what the differential is?

365
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:33,984
You'd  tell any other patient
what you found out.

366
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:41,154
<i>MRI showed a lesion
on your cingulate cortex.</i>

367
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:42,980
What's the thinking?

368
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:46,506
<i>Toxins are in the lead.
Viral's a distant second.</i>

369
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,449
Do you think the lesion
could be an abscess?

370
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:51,334
<i>It's just a small, soft area,
more mush than--</i>

371
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:54,182
Was there inflammation
in the lining of the ventricles?

372
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:57,092
<i>There was an increased
signal there, yeah.</i>

373
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,504
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

374
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:05,813
Staph infection.
Toxins lead to neurodegeneration,
which causes the lesion.

375
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:08,554
- <i>Not without a fever.</i>
- The cop had a fever.

376
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:12,874
Mine could be coming.
I could have got it directly from him,
or a dirty dish towel at his place.

377
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,927
Give us Omaya reservoirs.
Deliver linezolid directly into our brains.

378
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:19,265
And we're cured.

379
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:24,838
Samples tested negative
for toluene, arsenic, and lead.

380
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:25,906
House:
What about the blood?

381
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,341
Negative for West Nile
and Eastern equine.

382
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:30,643
We have to go back
to Joe's apartment,
get more samples--

383
00:22:30,727 --> 00:22:34,140
No one goes back to that place
till we know what we're looking for.

384
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,820
Get some of that cop tape.
Stick it over the doors and the windows.

385
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:40,410
I'll take all the Hazmat precautions.
The chance of infection is next to nothing.

386
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:43,554
Yeah,
I was never that great at math.
But next to nothing is...

387
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:45,045
higher than nothing, right?

388
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:46,876
It's not your fault
he got sick.

389
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:48,757
It would be his fault
if we did.

390
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:51,072
We should get a sample
directly from Joe's brain.

391
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:55,012
We can't do a biopsy.
There's too much edema from the bleeding
because you gave him heparin.

392
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:57,872
Well, I don't think this is
the time to be pointing fingers.

393
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,533
I didn't give Foreman any.

394
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:04,959
You want to give Foreman
a brain biopsy?

395
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:07,755
Come on, really,
who doesn't?

396
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,816
This could be
a simple staph infection
causing neurodegeneration.

397
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,257
- Without a fever? Not a chance.
- Joe had a fever.
- He also had Legionella.

398
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:19,556
The mush might be
forming an abscess.

399
00:23:19,654 --> 00:23:22,810
And since there was inflammation
of the lining of the ventricles,
it makes sense.

400
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:26,497
The staph releasestoxins,
causes neurodegeneration,
causes a lesion.

401
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:27,610
This is a waste of time.

402
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:31,042
We should put
an Omaya reservoir in Foreman's brain
and start administering antibi--

403
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:34,343
If I'm gonna be
arguing with Foreman,
I may as well do it directly.

404
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:38,105
[Thermometer bleeps]

405
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:50,737
Kernig's sign, negative.

406
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:57,478
Brudzinski's sign,
single positive.

407
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:00,969
[Joe groans in pain]

408
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:09,226
Patient Joe Luria,
distal and proximal arm contractures,
duration four seconds.

409
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:11,036
[Bang!]

410
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,735
Staph infection most commonly
presents on the skin.

411
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,096
Most commonly?

412
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,799
You wanna treat me
like any other patient, do it.

413
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:24,002
But the House I know never uses
phrases like "most commonly."

414
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:25,996
You're not laughing anymore.

415
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,130
No.

416
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:30,587
Think that's a good thing?

417
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,586
Sorta doubt it.

418
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:39,631
Staph would be in your heart,
lungs, spleen, liver, or kidneys
before it gets to your brain.

419
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:41,659
Your organs are clear.
It's not staph.

420
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:44,097
The infection could be
limited to a brain abscess.

421
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:46,745
Which I would have
seen in your MRI.

422
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:51,427
Sign this so that I can
take out a piece of your brain.

423
00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:55,836
Let me see the MRI.

424
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,675
There was no abscess
on the image.

425
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,613
Let me see it, then.

426
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:04,201
I liked you better
when you were jolly.

427
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:17,984
MRI was taken over an hour ago.
That soft spot could now be an abscess.

428
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:21,980
If it was staph, you'd have a fever.
Which you don't!

429
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:25,689
101.6.

430
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:28,154
What idiot gave you that?

431
00:25:28,322 --> 00:25:32,548
Put the Omaya reservoir in my skull
and treat me for the staph.

432
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:37,947
[High-pitched sound of the drill]

433
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:39,526
Foreman:
Triangle.

434
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:43,329
<i>This one?</i>

435
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,594
Uh...circle.

436
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:49,576
<i>Next.</i>

437
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,184
<i>Foreman,
why aren't you answering?
Is there a problem?</i>

438
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:54,472
Uh, s-square.

439
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:56,068
House:
<i>Tell me your date of birth.</i>

440
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:58,829
- Is that House?
- Chase: Yeah. Next.

441
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:00,698
A square again.
Why is he here?

442
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:03,541
<i>Because my neurologist
is having surgery.</i>

443
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,997
Thought I was
just another patient.

444
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,269
<i>You didn't believe
that crap, did you?</i>

445
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,395
<i>Date of birth.</i>

446
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,520
The Omaya reservoir is
inserted in the parietal lobe.

447
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:14,073
My spatial recognition is the issue,
not my memory.

448
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:18,488
<i>Oops! Did you say Omaya?
I could have sworn you said biopsy.</i>

449
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:20,799
<i>Hey, I'm just
messing with your head.</i>

450
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,943
<i>Mother's maiden name, please.</i>

451
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:25,962
Get out of my temporal lobe, House.

452
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,660
Hello?

453
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,576
Are you awake?

454
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:47,779
They told me
somebody was sick like me.

455
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:49,826
I'm up.

456
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:54,637
Your voice...

457
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,013
Aren't you my doctor?

458
00:26:59,421 --> 00:27:00,785
Not anymore.

459
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:04,940
You're the guy
who doesn't like cops.

460
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:07,673
Yeah.

461
00:27:08,562 --> 00:27:10,314
Can you see?

462
00:27:11,449 --> 00:27:12,752
You can't?

463
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:14,858
Not a thing.

464
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,703
You've been blind a while.
The fact that you're aware of it now...

465
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,900
It could be
a sign of improvement.

466
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,111
Aah.

467
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:34,116
It hurts so much.
Doesn't it?

468
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:36,821
I'm okay.

469
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:38,869
It's gonna hurt.

470
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,307
The morphine barely
takes the edge off.

471
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:48,646
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

472
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:52,353
You die, I die.
It's not gonna happen.

473
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:57,963
Why not?
You're just too stubborn to die?

474
00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:00,464
They took
a piece of my brain.

475
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:06,341
Whatever's wrong with us...
they'll find.

476
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:13,749
Do you believe in prayer?

477
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:22,442
Not really.

478
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:27,663
Neither do I.

479
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:32,881
My dad always prays.

480
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:36,582
So does mine.

481
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,853
Do you wanna try it?

482
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:47,312
Try prayin'?

483
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,124
Okay.

484
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:10,880
How is he?

485
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:13,130
Still dying.

486
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:18,098
Well, you've almost
mastered another skill, though.
That's good.

487
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:20,778
Foreman's biopsy results.

488
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,532
Non-specific signs
of inflammation.

489
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:27,221
That's it?

490
00:29:27,478 --> 00:29:31,002
We also swabbed for staph.
Negative. He's not even a carrier.

491
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:37,083
Well, at least
Foreman was wrong too.

492
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:39,557
Yeah, there's that.

493
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:42,844
Can I go to Joe's apartment now?

494
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:43,951
No.

495
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:45,786
Go back to the lab.

496
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,562
Start retesting all the samples
that Foreman collected.

497
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:50,328
- For what?
- Everything.

498
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,579
Bacteria, toxins, fungus.
Anything that likes to feast on brain.

499
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:56,730
- That's thousands of--
- Better hurry.

500
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,406
Cameron, suit up.
You're gonna monitor Foreman.

501
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,869
He's onto hand contractures.
He'll be in Anton's Blindness soon.

502
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:07,576
Run hourly checks,

he won't be able to tell us.

509
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,169
How many of your guys

from their patients?

510
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,673
Let me know when that happens.
Then we can have this conversation.

511
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:42,720
It's just another case, huh?

512

00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,638
There was a cupboard
above the stove. Did you see it?

523
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:24,483
I didn't check all the food,

You're thankful.

You're condoning this?!

562

I'm certainly not
going in there to stop him.

Ohh! Ohh!

His brain's telling him
that his whole body's in pain,

570
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:17,169
