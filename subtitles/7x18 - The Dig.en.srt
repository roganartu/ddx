<i>(Foreman)</i>
<i>It's most likely</i>
<i>that it's psychological.</i>

179
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,693
As to what's making him
cough blood,

180
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,228

<i>Declutter your home.</i>

182
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:40,631

<i>on hoarding.</i>

184
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:45,436
Ugh.

185
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,637
He doesn't have running water.

186
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,906
How does this guy live,

187
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,041
let alone make it to work every
day and teach a bunch of kids?

188
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:54,345
Fridge is on. He's hooked it up
to a neighbor or something.

189
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,550
Cat.

190
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:02,721
[Buzzing flies]

191
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,523
I might have to throw up.

192
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:06,525
He'll want to keep that too.

193
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,133
Aspergillosis.

194
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,901
Explains the coughing blood,

195
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:17,137
and if he's formed
small aspergillomas,

196
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:18,172
it could explain the headache
and chest pain.

197
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,541
I'll be in the car.

198
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:29,783
(Thirteen)
Okay, turn right.

199
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:31,318
You were writing
bogus prescriptions

200
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:34,154
for medical marijuana.

201
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:37,857
Please say no
because you have to be an idiot

202
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:38,959
to actually screw that up.

203
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:41,094
No.

204
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,430
I mean, I was,
but I didn't get caught.

205
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:47,134
I have to admit, you have
one of the best game faces

206
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:49,702
I've ever seen.

207
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,538
Also one
of the best game bodies.

208
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:53,807
Pull over.

209
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:58,611
Hang on a second.
[Clears throat]

210

[Grunts]

211
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:44,895
Didn't know you were
a Jehovah's Witness.

212
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:47,297
Yeah, the weak lost faith
when Christ didn't return

213
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:52,636
in '75,
but I still believe.

214
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,505
You're really not gonna tell me
what just happened?

215
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:59,709
I don't know about you,
but I am starving.

216
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,290
You broke
into my home?

217
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,827
We slowly pushed
into your home.

218
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:20,063
So what did you find?

219
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,632
A compost heap
in your fridge.

220
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,901
We think
you have aspergillosis.

221
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:25,703
It's treatable
with antifungals.

222
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,538
You do remarkably well
for living...

223
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:29,540
Like you live.

224
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:32,209
I use bottled water
and flashlights.

225
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:33,977
It's like camping.

226
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,880
Fun.

227
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,014
We're also gonna need
a psych consult.

228
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:39,649
I'm not a hoarder.

229
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:44,187
I'm just a major slob.

230
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,789
You save earwax.

231
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:54,465
You know,
I'm actually kind of hurt

232
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:55,866
that you don't know
what I did.

233
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,036
I'm not worth bribing
a court official

234
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:00,005
or hacking
into police records?

235
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,506
Where's the fun in that?

236
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:05,911
You could have at least hired
Cuddy's weird boyfriend.

237
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:08,514
Lucas?
Mm-hmm.

238
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:10,382
You don't know?

239
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,985
What, is he dead
or something?

240
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,686
No.

241
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:19,057
Actually, until
a couple of weeks ago,

242
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,159
I was Cuddy's
weird boyfriend.

243
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:22,560
[Laughs]

244
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:25,429
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

245
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:40,113
Are--are you okay?

246
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:43,350
Yeah, I'm fine.

247
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:47,655
It's not a big deal.

248
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,464
I killed a man.

249
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:13,613
Psych eval gave us nothing.

250
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:14,918
So our patient
is just an average Joe

251
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,187
with a two-foot pile
of used q-tips?

252
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:18,755
Whatever he is,
he doesn't have aspergillosis.

253
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:21,024
Pain's intensified,
and now he needs oxygen.

254
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:22,692
There's got to be all kinds
of toxins in that place.

255
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,227
Exposure issues
don't make sense.

256
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:25,362
He's been here a full day.
He'd be getting better,

257
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:26,730
not worse.

258
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,699
Unless exposure was keeping him
from getting worse.

259
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,034
<i>The gas was off</i>
<i>at his place.</i>

260
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:32,302
<i>How does he stay warm?</i>
Portable heater?

261
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,938
Or portable gas heater,

262
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,539
which emits carbon monoxide.

263
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,042
Which is a vasodilator.

264
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,477
The low-grade exposure
was actually improving

265
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,712
<i>his lung capacity.</i>

266
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,847

268
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,183

two days off.

<i>(Chase)</i>
<i>We still have to prove it.</i>

270
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,319
Someone's got to go back

271
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,388
into that place
and test for C.O.

272
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,889
Chase and I can go.

273
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,092
It's only fair.

274
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,660

Sorry.
That's just how I get

277
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:09,506
around people
who have recently killed a man.

278
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:12,775
It wasn't...

279
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:14,344
You know, I've had
a pretty rough year.

280
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:15,779
Do you think maybe we could just
give this whole thing a rest?

281
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:19,682
You killed a man.

282
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,952
But you pled out to drugs.

285
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:28,558

I'm asking you to let it go.

287
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,628
And I really wish
I was the kind of person

288
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:32,862

to go out with him?

535
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:13,294

<i>Might be safer</i>

538
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:18,433

You know,
maybe Taub is right,

Shine up your spuds, folks.

545
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:40,925
We're gonna start shooting

546
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:42,627
in just a few minutes.

547
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:45,363
The wind's coming
from the southeast.

548
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,900
You have to aim five degrees
to the left.

549
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,768
We're gonna break 14 seconds.
I can feel it.

550
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:52,437
When I was 10 or 11,

551
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,039
my dad used to take us
to this county fair.

552
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:58,110
And there was this kid...

553
00:28:58,178 --> 00:28:59,678
What?

554
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:02,681
Who's "us"?

555
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:04,549
My mom and me.

556
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:09,320
Your mom who had
advanced stage Huntington's.

557
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:16,929
You have a sibling
that you've never mentioned.

558
00:29:16,997 --> 00:29:18,364
Why did you slip up now?

559
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:21,000
Not everything

We're gonna be up soon.

561
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,272
I want to check
the pressure.

562
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:30,311
You don't wake up in the middle

<i>over a dead stranger.</i>

564
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,714
You don't confess
to killing a man

565
00:29:33,782 --> 00:29:35,116
and then hide the details

566
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:36,884
unless the details reveal
more about you

567
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:40,688
than the crime itself.

568
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:41,890
You pled down to drugs.

569
00:29:41,957 --> 00:29:45,060
You've got
a horrible genetic disease

570
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:49,364
and a sibling
who's suddenly on your mind.

571
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,436
You euthanized your brother.

572
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,371
And that guy back at the house
was the doctor

573
00:29:56,439 --> 00:30:01,143
who wouldn't help you
cover it up.

574
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:02,444
The guy back at the house

575
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:04,046
is my cellmate's boyfriend.

576
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:07,349
He cheated on her
when she was inside.

577
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:10,586
But I was right
about everything else.

578
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:15,257
Congratulations.

579
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,375
You're mad.

580
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:35,577
No.

581
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:37,812
Actually,
I'm impressed.

582
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,281
Messing around
on a 22-year-old hottie

583
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:42,416
with your wife
on my sofa.

584
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:44,618
You're a full-throttle
head case.

585
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,153
I was doing you a solid
with the sofa.

586
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,322
Rachel wanted to do it
in your bed.

587
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,357
You've got
the memory foam top.

588
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:52,058
Let's make this
really simple:

589
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:55,829
If I own it, I don't
want you doing it on it.

590
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:59,064
You might want to get rid
of your kitchen table.

591
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:01,800
<i>Look, I'm sorry,</i>

592
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:03,868
<i>but it was worth it.</i>
Yeah, I bet.

593
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,403
<i>You get to mess with her</i>
<i>physically and emotionally.</i>

594
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:06,871
I still care about her.

595
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:09,040
Not enough to let her move on
with her life.

596
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,213
<i>While we're talking</i>
<i>about your bad ideas,</i>

597
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:16,015
MRI's clean.

598
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,417
(Masters)
There has to be some kind

599
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:21,387
of inciting
psychological incident.

600
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:23,489
This is perfect for you.

601
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:26,393
You get all
the human interaction you crave

602
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:28,328
without any actual
human interaction.

603
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:30,631
She was a cheerleader.
Huh.

604
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:31,831
<i>You know when you're interested</i>
<i>in something</i>

605
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,333
and nobody else is,
the polite thing

606
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:34,834
is to keep it to yourself.

607
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:36,102
<i>Popular, beautiful,</i>

608
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,570

00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,705
Hydrogen sulfide's
about two parts per billion.

610
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,174
The size of a healthy fart.

611
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:49,513
I'll be back for you
in July.

612
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:10,771
He couldn't do it himself.

613
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:14,375
He was--the disease
had progressed too far.

614
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:15,809
He was flailing.

615
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:20,480
He didn't have any control
over his own body.

616
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:25,251
He pretty much lost control
of his mind too,

617
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,019
but...

618
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:29,521
Every once in a while,
he would have a few seconds

619
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:32,824
of lucidity.

620
00:32:32,892 --> 00:32:35,693
He turned to me,
and he said,

621
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:39,598
"it's time."

622
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:44,503
I hooked up the I.V.

623
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,338
I used gloves.
I knew they'd get me

624
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:47,539
on the drugs,
but they couldn't prove

625
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:50,475
who pushed the plunger.

626
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,224
I put in the needle,

627
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,960
and he just...

628
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,696
Got quiet.

629
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:12,599
And it was over.

630
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:20,439
And I was alone.

631
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:23,675
And one day,
I will be that sick,

632
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:26,311
and there will be no one there

633
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,247
when it's time.

634
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,868
[Laughs]

635
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:53,372
I didn't expect compassion
from you.

636
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,608
I would have taken
commiseration.

637
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:58,511
Hell, I would have taken
revulsion,

638
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:02,348
any emotional engagement
at all.

639
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:09,756
It's no wonder
Cuddy broke up with you.

I know

with the soon-to-be
five-time runner-up,

650
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:55,168
so she's probably got
some self-esteem issues.

651
00:35:03,446 --> 00:35:04,446
You wouldn't.

00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:43,125
So?
Warning.

654
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,434
They gave you
a warning?

655
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:46,107
Well, it turns out
our friend Harold

656
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:47,876
felt up the sheriff's daughter

657
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:49,711
last night
at the potato mash mixer,

658
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:51,781
so sheriff's feeling
kind of ambivalent.

659
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:55,151
You always get your way,
don't you?

660
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:58,655
Not always.

661
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:05,494
Today would have been
our one-year anniversary.

662
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:11,667
Which is an incredibly
arbitrary thing to celebrate.

663
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:18,441
If you want to get
to the bottom of something,

664
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,879
you literally have
to dig down to the bottom.

665
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:25,383
So stratigraphically,
the oldest stuff I found

00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:10,088
It also causes miscarriages.

707
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:16,527
Is that something
you think you might have?

708
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:31,444
Were you pregnant?

709
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:36,249
Three times.

710
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:43,790
<i>The miscarriages</i>
<i>triggered the hoarding.</i>

711
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:47,561
<i>Hoarding eventually</i>
<i>made you sick too.</i>

712
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:50,164
Can you cure her?

713
00:38:50,232 --> 00:38:52,199
<i>We can treat</i>
<i>the physical symptoms</i>

714
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:54,235
<i>as they arise,</i>

715
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:56,370
<i>make her life</i>
<i>a lot better,</i>

716
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:59,373
but the hoarding,

717
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:01,709
we're the wrong kind
of doctors.

718
00:39:05,781 --> 00:39:08,383
You lied to me?

719
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,218
For nine years?

720
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:15,656
I was so afraid
of losing you.

721
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:21,429
What have I ever done
to make you afraid of that?

722
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,505
I need to get some air.

[Sobbing]

724
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,757
I've been selfish.

725
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:51,625
I need to let you

726
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:54,861
move on.

727
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:59,099
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

728
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,400
No.

729
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:04,271
Um, I just want you
to be able to--

730
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,040
the last time
you got all noble on me,

731
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:08,242
we ended up dividing
our dishes.

732
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,644
This time, I want
to make the decision.

733
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,714
You don't feel weird
about this?

734
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:16,483
Of course
I feel weird about this.

735
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:19,219
It's confusing
and messy

736
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:21,388
and dirty.

737
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:23,990
Dumb.

738
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:25,458
But we spent our whole lives
trying to do everything right,

739
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,126
and it sucked.
It wasn't all bad.

740
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:29,095
It sucked, Chris.

741
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:31,363
And this,

742
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,265
whatever it is,

743
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,833
it's fun.

744
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:40,305
So I'm not
taking advantage of you?

745
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:43,042
The fun is fading.

746
00:40:45,814 --> 00:40:48,982
You know...

747
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,385
there's something
seriously wrong with us.

748
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:54,990
I know.
