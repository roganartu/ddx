1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,920
(BOTH GRUNTING)

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,640
She almost took my head off.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,480
Your fault.
You didn't guard
your left side.

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,880
Point.

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,400
Stop, stop, stop!

6
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,720
Addie, you're bleeding.

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,680
I never even hit her.

8
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,840
Good morning.

9
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,880
This is funny. People don't...

10
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
Not done reading. Go away.

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,200
Most likely,
she coughed it up.

12
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,360
Which would mean
it's from her lungs.
Drugs, toxins, infection...

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,960
No fever and
no elevated white count.
Which rules out infection.

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,840
And blood panels
found no drugs, no toxins.

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,800
The bronchoscopy was pristine.
So much for the lungs.

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,600
Good morning.
Not yet.

17
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,920
So then, the blood came
from her stomach.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,880
Which would mean
it's an ulcer or a GI bleed.

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,640
<i>ER also did an upper
and lower GI.
No occult blood in her stool.</i>

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,440
Which means no ulcer
or GI bleed.

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,040
Which means it's not from
the stomach, either.

22
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,560
Which means it didn't
come from anywhere.

23
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,040
You guys get to the point
where the blood didn't
come from anywhere?

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
Rupture in her sinus cavity?
Drip through the back?

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Not that much blood.
Trauma from karate?

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
No trauma. She kicked
the other guy's ass.

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,360
Now a good time?

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,720
If you can tell me how blood
can mysteriously
appear in a...

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,160
Now. This includes you.

30
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,120
What's going on?

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,120
Feel free to speculate
amongst yourselves.

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,760
Are you sure?
Yeah.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
Why?

34
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,400
He's afraid of
turning into me.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,600
Well, that's a
good enough reason.

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,160
Sign here.

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,560
Doesn't look promising.

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,680
Good luck.

39
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,480
Thank you.
That's it?

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,200
You're not going to tell him
that we're a family

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,920
and families don't
abandon each other?

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,560
You want me to?
No.

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,400
Would it make any difference?
No.

44
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,720
Good luck, Dr. Foreman.

45
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,680
So, where were we?

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,760
College sophomore
coughing up blood.

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,400
Not the case. The speculation.
The palace intrigue.
The rising self-doubts.

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,720
HOUSE: Did Foreman
get a promotion?

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,040
I resigned.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,200
What?

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,320
Personally, I can't believe
I've had the same three
employees for three years.

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,760
Patient could have
a heart problem.

53
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,760
Yes. Life goes on.
Look at the eager beaver
combing his hair.

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,480
Hyper-dynamic heart
could force too much blood
into her lungs.

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,760
She coughed up the overflow.

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,480
Wouldn't leave a trace in her
lungs because it's traveling
through normal plumbing.

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,480
Foreman,
go do a stress echo test
to see if he's right.

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
Cameron? Check out the dorm,
then re-do the ER labs.

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
I'll get going on
Foreman's farewell party.

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,880
Everybody good
with a "Mermaid Under
the Stars" theme?

61
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
So, why are you leaving?

62
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,960
Or is it just
some sort of power play?

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,640
You can have my parking space,
my locker.

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,320
Is it about House?

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,760
Let me get all sensitive
and confide in you.

66
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,880
Addie? Pedal harder.
Need your heart rate at 170.

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,000
Why wouldn't you
want to tell me?

68
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,320
I don't like you.
Never have. Never will.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,680
You want me to
share some more?

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
Even if you do hate me,
if you'd found another job,
you'd tell me.

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,720
If House did something
to drive you out of here,
you'd tell me.

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,080
The fact that you won't
tell me means that
whatever the real reason is

73
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,640
you're ashamed of it.

74
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,280
ADDIE: Guys? I'm at 170.

75
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,920
Pulmonary artery looks good.
It's not a heart problem.

76
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
Are you cold?
No.

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,360
Scared?
I'm okay. Why?

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,840
On your arm.

79
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
Addie has goose bumps.

80
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,680
No recovering
from those babies.

81
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
You don't have goose bumps
for no reason.

82
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,840
They're a reaction
to the body thinking
it's cold.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,400
She wasn't cold.
Her temperature was normal.

84
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,320
But her body thought it was.
Which means...

85
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,040
What? A brain problem?

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
A messed up hypothalamus
could cause goose bumps

87
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,080
but they're not going to
cause her to cough up blood.

88
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,080
She has no neurological
issues. She had a shiver.

89
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,320
I think there's an infection.

90
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
We've ruled out infection
because no fever,
no white count.

91
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,840
I think there's an infection.

92
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,160
Blood goes where it's needed.
Infection likes nice,
wet places. Her lungs.

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,360
Start treatment. All that cool
stuff for bacterial, fungal,
and atypical infections.

94
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,200
Get a lung biopsy.
I want to see the
little bugger up close.

95
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Why is Foreman quitting?

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,320
He wants to breed llamas.

97
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,560
Interesting.

98
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,440
You're ashamed
of the reason, too.

99
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,760
No one writes tamoxifen
like you.

100
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,960
Well, I use a "G."

101
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760
Foreman resigned.

102
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
It's okay. No biggie.

104
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,800
Right. He give a reason?

105
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,880
He said he didn't want to
end up like me.
I had a brilliant retort.

106
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,160
I can't remember
what it was at the moment.

107
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,800
You don't want to
end up like you.

108
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,640
Good point. Can I resign?

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,800
What's up with that?

110
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,360
With what?
You yawned.

111
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,840
I just told you
something interesting,
so you're not bored.

112
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,480
It's 11:00 in the morning,
you're drinking coffee,
so you're not tired.

113
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,360
I didn't yawn, so it's not
a mirror-neuron reaction.

114
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,400
Which leaves symptom.
Vasovagal issue,
maybe a heart problem.

115
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,200
My heart's fine.
I was up late.

116
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,760
You're just deflecting
having a conversation
about Foreman.

117
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm okay with Foreman leaving.

118
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,720
Either you're lying,
or you don't really think
he's leaving

119
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,640
or you just jumped
right to acceptance.

120
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,400
I'm sorry. I yawned
because I was trying to
communicate boredom.

121
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,000
You could try bargaining
with him. Give him a raise.

122
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,440
How much do you think
it would cost to make him
want to be like me?

123
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,200
Thanks for the coffee.

124
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,960
She seems fine.

125
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,000
She is fine.
She coughed up blood.

126
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,800
Past tense.
She has diarrhea.

127
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,360
From the antibiotics
for the infection.

128
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,440
Lung biopsy says
she doesn't have an infection.

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,880
Well, then, you screwed up
the biopsy.

130
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,480
Or you're wrong
about infection.

131
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
If I'm wrong,
then so is her body.

132
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,880
Because it obviously thinks
she's got an infection,

133
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
or it wouldn't have
gotten better
from the antibiotics.

134
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,680
What is pandiculation
symptomatic of?

135
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,680
Yawning is a symptom
of fatigue or
cholinergic excitation.

136
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,000
Does this have anything
to do with Addie?

137
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
Let's say yes.

138
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,080
Cerebral tumor, epilepsy...

139
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,680
Could also be a medication
reaction to antidepressants

140
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,720
or some meds for
end-stage liver failure.

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,320
Let's say no.

142
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,600
You don't want to
leave this job.

143
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,960
Three years you've been here.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
You've never once laughed
at anything he said.

145
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,280
Because I wasn't
kissing his ass.

146
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
But now, you are?
No. Now, you're nervous.

147
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
Uncomfortable about
your decision.
Wasn't even that good a joke.

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,720
Oh, crap.

149
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,040
Most of your jokes
are excellent. I just meant
in comparison.

150
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,200
Shut up.
I think she may not
have an infection.

151
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,440
Better deal with her
before she crashes.

152
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,880
She can't breathe.
Get off the bed.

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,280
Need a crash cart.

154
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,360
What's happening?

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
Let's get her down. Now.

156
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,440
Pressure's collapsing
her lungs.
She's not getting any air.

157
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,960
Oh, my God.

158
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,520
CHASE: She couldn't breathe
because she had
a pleural effusion.

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,080
Thoracentesis revealed
low protein count,
effusion was transudative,

160
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,800
which means she has
cirrhosis of the liver,
or she's in heart failure.

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,160
Heart was fine,
liver enzymes were normal.

162
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,400
There's something
called "blude"
in the pleural effusion.

163
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,280
Oh. It's not "blude,"
it's blood.

164
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,760
Which is great. Not for her,
but for me. Because it means
I think it's an infection.

165
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,440
Labs indicated
minute traces of blood.

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,600
You can't ignore the blood
because it's a minority.
Can you, Foreman?

167
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,440
If we count the traces
of blood as significant,

168
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,680
the differential
isn't just infection.

169
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,080
Could be lung cancer,
breast cancer, lymphoma...

170
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,320
Great. Go tell her
she's got one of those.

171
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,920
Or you can tell her that we
haven't given her enough
antibiotics for her infection.

172
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,040
Double the dose.
Then check her lungs.

173
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,040
We checked her lungs.
They're clean.

174
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,440
On the outside.
She needs an arteriogram.

175
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,920
It's about my bowel movements.

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,480
What isn't, these days?

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,520
You sure you want to
be here for this?

178
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
We do everything together.

179
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,840
Of course.
A toilet can be
a lonely place.

180
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,640
Drop your pants. I'll suit up.

181
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
They float.
Huh?

182
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,440
My bowel movements.
Honey says they're
not supposed to?

183
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,800
I'm a nutritionist.

184
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,360
Yes, I could tell from
the cool toe-loop sandals.

185
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,080
Thank you.
You're welcome.

186
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,960
And the natural fiber
clothing, I assume,

187
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,920
means some kind of
vegetarian denomination?

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,040
We're vegans. At first,
I was a little concerned
about the lack of protein

189
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,320
but Honey showed me
you can get it from lots...

190
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,480
Well, whatever floats
your poop.

191
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,440
And you've been together
how long? Six months?

192
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,160
How did you know?

193
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,720
Because after six months,
poop love fades

194
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,080
and if you'd been together
shorter than that, then...

195
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll explain
right after this break.

196
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,360
Three 10-milligram pills
of your finest amphetamines.

197
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,240
Arteriogram was normal.

198
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,240
CHASE: Which means
her lungs are fine.

199
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,280
What if the clear
arteriogram is significant?

200
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,920
It is significant.
It means there's no infection.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,280
I think there's an infection.

202
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,600
CAMERON: Infections don't
come and go.

203
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,400
People don't get
better then worse
on the same treatment.

204
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,120
Unless her body can't
finish off the fight.

205
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
Maybe goes a couple of rounds,
then gives up.

206
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Why would it give up?

207
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,080
Maybe its name is Foreman.

208
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,400
Come on. Where's that smile?

209
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,280
That laugh that makes
the whole world sunny

210
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,800
without contributing
to global warming?

211
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,480
Maybe she's missing a protein.

212
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,600
Blood panel and enzymes
show her proteins are normal.

213
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,000
You can't have tested
for every protein.

214
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,560
I can think of at least one
you can't test for at all.

215
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,000
Complement factor-H
deficiency.
If she has that, she's dead.

216
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,280
No way to fend off bacteria.

217
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,200
She'll get one infection
after another until
her body shuts down.

218
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,840
Maybe we can get ahead
of the game. Manage each
symptom as it comes up.

219
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,520
Give her five miserable years
instead of six
miserable months.

220
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,760
There's no diagnostic test
for complement
factor-H deficiency.

221
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,040
So we isolate the cells
that are yummiest for it.

222
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
Stick a needle in her eye.

223
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,840
You're cheating on Honey.

224
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,960
What? No. I'm not.

225
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
Oh, yes, you are.

226
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,320
It's okay. I get it.

227
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,960
Well, I was
going to say relax.

228
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,040
But, oddly enough, you seem
pretty relaxed already.

229
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,000
You're accomplished.
You're funny.

230
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,640
You can have
whatever you want.
Women are gonna...

231
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,840
He's not cheating
with another woman.

232
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,200
He's cheating with
another food group.

233
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,360
What?

234
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,040
His floaters float
because they're full of fat.

235
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,840
Probably had a big
cheeseburger for lunch.

236
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,000
You're eating flesh?

237
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,160
It's just a hamburger.
Not all the time...

238
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,760
You're disgusting.

239
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,640
Soy cakes taste like
cardboard.
Unsalted cardboard.

240
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,680
I'm accomplished. I'm funny.

241
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,880
Can I have whatever I want?

242
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,120
Can we wait a second?

243
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,800
What's wrong?
I feel good.

244
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,280
Do you really need to
put that needle in?

245
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,800
You felt good yesterday,
and then you almost
suffocated.

246
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,280
And you know that,
that thing is in my eye?

247
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
We think it could be.

248
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,400
If we find it,
the hope is that
we can treat it.

249
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,000
You hope?
Mom.
Don't hang on every word.

250
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,960
He said he hopes.
That means he doesn't know.

251
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,080
I just want to understand
what's going on.

252
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,560
We won't know anything
until we do the test.

253
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,880
Addie, this all looks
really scary, but you'll
feel nothing. Okay?

254
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,080
Okay.

255
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,240
You rang?
You called me.

256
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,400
I bought you an espresso.

257
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,120
You've been buying me coffee
for a couple of weeks.

258
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,400
I thought I'd
pay you back with one.

259
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,000
How did you walk
with the cane
and the two coffees?

260
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,480
Why are you suspicious?

261
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,160
Because it's either that,
or accept the fact that you've
done something nice.

262
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,680
And then I have to deal with
the horsemen and the rain
of fire and the end of days.

263
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,240
You think I spat in yours?

264
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,720
Or worse.

265
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,080
I stacked them.

266
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,640
What do you think of me
hiring a nutritionist
instead of a neurologist?

267
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
I mean, they sound
almost the same.

268
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
I take it you've met
a hot nutritionist.

269
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,640
Don't cheapen this.

270
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,320
We had an in-depth
conversation
about proteins and fats.

271
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,800
I was about to
examine her boyfriend's
rectum.

272
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,360
You asked for a date
while your finger was
in her boyfriend?

273
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,560
I got her number.

274
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,600
No. No. No way.

275
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,560
This is an employment
application.

276
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,480
She doesn't want to
go out with you.
She's looking for a job.

277
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Oh, God. She's 26.

278
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,640
But with the wisdom
of a much younger woman.

279
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,040
Have you spoken to Foreman?

280
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,960
Several times. We laughed...

281
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,160
You're going to lose him.

282
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,640
And that will be depressing.

283
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,880
But it will only make me
appreciate all the good things
that I do have.

284
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,960
Macular biopsy was negative.
Which means you're wrong.

285
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,000
There's no complement
factor-H deficiency.

286
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,560
Most likely cause of altering
blood flow in the brain
is a clot or a tumor.

287
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,920
We can rule out a clotting
issue because she has
a bleeding issue.

288
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,640
Which means we should be
looking for a tumor.

289
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,800
I think there's an infection.

290
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,880
Just 'cause the cells in
her eye aren't dead yet
doesn't mean they're working.

291
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,120
So, why did we do the test?

292
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,920
Because if it had been
positive, it would have
proved I was right.

293
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,480
But negative doesn't
prove you wrong?

294
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,240
That's the beauty of the test.

295
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,320
She needs an MRI of her brain.

296
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,440
Absolutely.

297
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,000
As long as you're scanning,
you mind having a boo
for an abscess

298
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,240
for something
caused by an infection?

299
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,680
I didn't expect House
to beg me to stay.

300
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,000
But it seems like he's
in a better mood since I quit.

301
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,840
Nothing in the axial view.

302
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,400
You haven't asked me
why I'm leaving.

303
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,520
I figured you'd tell me
when you wanted to.

304
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,200
I don't want to be like him.

305
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,760
You're not a jerk.

306
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,920
Thank you.

307
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,840
I mean, sometimes you are.

308
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,480
But I don't think we can
pin that on House.

309
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,680
And you're a better doctor
than when you
came through the door.

310
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,840
I'm better at some things.
Worse at others.

311
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,720
Again, not House's fault.
It's a job.

312
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,280
We're supposed to
take the good
and leave the bad.

313
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,080
It's easier for you.

314
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,920
Why? Because you think
I need to toughen up?

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,600
You think I'm weak?

316
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,800
Yeah.

317
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,520
See? I am a jerk.
I've got to get out of here.

318
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,600
(ADDIE GROANING)

319
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,800
What's wrong, Addie?

320
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,080
My head hurts!

321
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,120
Her brain's clean.
No tumor and no abscess.

322
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,920
We're all wrong.
My head!

323
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,840
(SCREAMING)

324
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,160
My head!

325
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,480
My head!

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,640
Grody.

327
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,560
Looks like massive
tissue death.

328
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,040
Who cares? Her head blew up.

329
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,760
How cool is that?
CAMERON: It's not pussy.

330
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,000
Meaning you don't think
it's an infection and you'd be
right, if you weren't wrong.

331
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,120
Here we go again.

332
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,680
She's got infections
that come and go.

333
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,880
Which means...
It means it has to be
something else.

334
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,800
Good guess. But no.

335
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,680
It either she's got
a leprechaun in her colon,

336
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,520
which is playing
with the doggie door,

337
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,680
letting bacteria in and out,
or she's got complement
factor-H deficiency.

338
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,800
You enjoying this?

339
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,160
I'm saving a woman's life.

340
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,520
I'm saving a woman's life!
Actually, I'm diagnosing her.

341
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,920
Technically, I'm diagnosing
her with something that's
going to kill her.

342
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,480
But, other than that,
I'm saving her life.

343
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,680
An autoimmune problem
makes more sense.

344
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,480
You can't explain
a transudative
pleural effusion

345
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,000
with giant cell arteritis.

346
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,760
You'd need three whiteboards
and 100 different
colored markers.

347
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,200
No, it's much more likely
she has an invisible protein

348
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,680
that allowed bacteria
to arbitrarily
invade her lungs

349
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,320
then arbitrarily invade
her pleura, then arbitrarily
jump into her head.

350
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,160
If it's autoimmune,
she can live.

351
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,200
But we have to give her
steroids, now.
Before her heart ruptures.

352
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,280
If you're wrong,
and you give her
steroids she dies, now.

353
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,480
Foreman. Want to run down
how it feels to go with your
gut and kill a person?

354
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,680
You can get into
the whole spiraling
out of control,

355
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,680
and the self-doubt,
and the resigning thing.

356
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,920
Do it.

357
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,160
Worst that can happen
is you quit.

358
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,560
Cameron, want to explain
to the parents

359
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,000
why you'll be holding paddles
while he's doing it?

360
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,200
Because if her heart goes
"boom", it will
"boom" right away.

361
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,320
She really has to be
awake for this?

362
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,680
If there's a problem,
she could tell us
what she feels.

363
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,560
Relax.

364
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,800
We're scared.

365
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
I don't want you to be scared.

366
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
Then, get better.
Okay, sweetie?

367
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
We love you.

368
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,400
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,800
Ready?

370
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,880
Ready.

371
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,840
My patient's about to have
a heart attack.
It's going to be massive.

372
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,880
Oh, wow. That's too bad.

373
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,720
Because I just got
tickets to a stroke
on the third floor.

374
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,200
Have you had
a conversation with Foreman?

375
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Do me a favor?

376
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,520
You haven't.

377
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,920
Because then you would have to
confront your own emotions.

378
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,400
Is bile an emotion?
Because I definitely feel
something here.

379
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Get me some liquorice.
This is going to be the
best heart attack of all time.

380
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,880
Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
She's going to shock her.

381
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,120
There's always tomorrow.

382
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,360
You wanted to see me?

383
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,160
Pretty sure the label
is straight.

384
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,840
Are you really going to leave?
Where are you going?

385
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,440
You lined up interviews yet?
I'm not sure.

386
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,320
You're pissed at House.
I get it. You're
symbolicating killing him.

387
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,080
Symbolicating. What?
Symbolicalating.

388
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,960
Gosh, that's a hard word.
Are you okay?

389
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,560
Hey, I'm not the one...
I'm not the one...

390
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,480
I'm not the one
pretending to kill someone.

391
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,240
What would it take for you
to stay? Is it money?
He wants you to stay.

392
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,720
He said that?
If I said he said that,

393
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,400
(PHONE RINGING)
Would that make a difference?

394
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,760
Are you sure you're okay?
Hello?

395
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,320
I'm leaving now.

396
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,440
I'm late for a breast thing.
You know he wants you.

397
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,600
You know he's good.
You know he can make you good.

398
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,320
I don't know what I'm saying.
You know... I don't...
You know what I'm saying.

399
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,640
And you know I'm right.
I've got to go.

400
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,200
Sorry it took me so long to
get down here. I'm Dr. Wilson.

401
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,640
I guess Dr. Stein is gone.
Don't worry about it.

402
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,520
I'll talk to him
when we're done.

403
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,800
Dr. Stein said
they're probably
calcium deposits.

404
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,160
But with your medical history,
you don't want to
take chances.

405
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,200
I can't seem to
put my gloves on today.
That's weird.

406
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,920
Okay. Well, that's fine.
One's enough.
Well, let's have a look.

407
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,840
You sure talk fast.

408
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,920
This is nothing.
You should see me
when we're busy.

409
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,000
I just winked at you.
I just... I've never winked
at a patient in my life.

410
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,360
I have no... I am so sorry.
I have no idea
what I was thinking.

411
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,320
It's okay.
No, it's not.
I was hitting on you.

412
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,760
I mean, I wasn't...
I wasn't consciously
hitting on you, but I...

413
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,800
What else could you think?
That you were
being reassuring?

414
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,800
Yeah. That would make sense.
On the other hand, I...

415
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,800
I feel like my heart's
going to explode.

416
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,160
Are you okay?

417
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,680
I feel a little sweaty.
Am I sweating?

418
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
Yeah.

419
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,320
Is something wrong?
I can't...

420
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,120
I put on gloves to do
a breast exam. Perfect. Sorry.

421
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,720
It's 185.

422
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,480
One eighty-five.

423
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,840
One eighty-five?

424
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,880
Excuse me.
I have to go kill someone.

425
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,360
<i>(BANGING ON DOOR)</i>

426
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,120
You dosed me!

427
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,360
Yes, I did. But only because
you didn't trust me.

428
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Your best friend!

429
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,680
You could have killed me!

430
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,240
Amphetamines aren't
going to kill you.

431
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,800
You don't know
my medical history!

432
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,960
I could have...
I could have...

433
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,840
You could have given me
a heart attack!

434
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,280
A heart attack is not
going to kill you.
You were in a hospital.

435
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,880
You yawned!

436
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,880
You tried to kill me!

437
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,600
I put you on uppers
and you still yawned.

438
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,680
Means it's a symptom
of being a big, fat liar.

439
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,280
Yawning is a side effect
of some anti-depressants.

440
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,680
Apparently,
the ones you're on.

441
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,560
I'm not on anti-depressants,
I'm on speed.

442
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,720
That means it's a symptom
of a cerebral tumor.

443
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,440
You got six weeks to live.

444
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,200
Mr. Well-adjusted
is as messed up
as the rest of us.

445
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,600
Why... Why would you
keep that a secret?

446
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,320
Are you ashamed of recognizing
how pathetic your life is?

447
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,960
It's not a secret.
House, it's... It's...

448
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,560
It's personal.

449
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,600
How long has it been personal?
It's personal.

450
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,080
Yawning is recent.
So, either you just started,

451
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,000
or you changed prescriptions.
This is why I take them.

452
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,840
They're anti-depressants,
not anti-annoyance-ants.

453
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,840
You'd think this would
naturally come up
in conversation.

454
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,960
Oh, don't act hurt.
You don't care.

455
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,240
On one of the occasions
when you were pompously
lecturing me

456
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,360
on what to do to fix my life.

457
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,600
You wouldn't take them.
You'd rather OD on Vicodin

458
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,840
or stick electrodes in your
head, because you could say
you did it to get high.

459
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,040
The only reason to
take anti-depressants
is because you're depressed.

460
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,280
You... You have to admit
that you're depressed.

461
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,560
Give me.

462
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,520
Are you going to admit that...

463
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,280
No, I'm gonna prove
that I'm not depressed.

464
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,080
Well, I can't give you
my prescription. You've got to
meet with a psychiatrist.

465
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,360
You... You need
a whole work-up.

466
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,400
Give me a Vicodin
so I don't stroke.

467
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,320
I wouldn't drink that.

468
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,920
My leg hurt, and I...

469
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,520
(PHONE RINGING)

470
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,680
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

471
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,280
(DOOR CREAKING)

472
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,560
House, why didn't you
pick up the phone?

473
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,320
We've been calling.
I was sleeping.

474
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,960
What did you do?

475
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,240
Nothing.

476
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,720
This is how regular
people look when
you wake them up.

477
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,280
Chase was wrong.
Addie's kidneys shut down.

478
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,960
Hemolytic uremic syndrome
shut down Addie's kidneys.

479
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,840
Peripheral smear of red cells
had schistocytes.

480
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,720
HUS is usually caused
by an infection
or protein deficiency.

481
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,320
What a coincidence.

482
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,560
I know a patient
with an infection
and a protein deficiency.

483
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,840
Do you think it's possible
there's a connection?

484
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,080
I want to hear you say it,
Chase. It will please me.

485
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,280
Doesn't mean you're right.
You predicted cardiac arrest,

486
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,960
instant cardiac arrest.

487
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,680
There were only two choices.

488
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,840
Since yours was wrong,
mine must have been right.

489
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,360
Either that,
or we missed the leprechaun.

490
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,840
If you're right,
there's nothing to be done.

491
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,600
The steroid treatment
we gave her means

492
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,400
when the next infection hits,
it will hit hard.
Liver failure, cardiac arrest.

493
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,520
On the bright side
it confirms my diagnosis.

494
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Don't you see how incredible
this call was?
A protein deficiency.

495
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,240
It can't be tested.
Can't be seen.

496
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
I called it based
on coughing blood.

497
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,360
You're happy about this.

498
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,680
She's going to die.

499
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,120
That's not my fault.

500
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,000
She was going to die, anyway.

501
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,240
And now, thanks to me,
at least she'll know why.

502
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,600
I'm sure you'll see
that gratitude in her eyes
when you tell her.

503
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
I'm not telling her.

504
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
I'm not telling her.

505
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,320
No one's telling her.
Not until we're sure
I'm right.

506
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,920
But we're waiting for her to
stroke or have a heart attack
to confirm before we tell her?

507
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,120
Seems like
the humane approach.

508
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,480
Her heart went into V-fib.
Brought her back, barely.

509
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,400
Congratulations,
you have your confirmation.

510
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,520
What's her name?

511
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,160
Who? The co-ed?
Sure.

512
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,880
Dead sophomore girl?

513
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,960
You know her father's name?

514
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,400
Dad. Her mother's name
is Mommy.

515
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,200
Ben and Jody are about to lose
their only daughter, Addie.

516
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,840
You think that they're
gonna give a crap
if I know their names?

517
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,360
Five years from now,
when the father's looking
at photographs

518
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,440
of his daughter
graduating from high school,

519
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,280
they're not going to remember
the nice black doctor

520
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,440
who called them
by their first name.

521
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,080
You don't wanna quit.

522
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,120
You saying you
don't want me to quit?

523
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,840
Didn't sound like I said that.

524
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm saying that suddenly
you're trying to turn me into
a kinder, gentler ass.

525
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,080
Because you know who you are.

526
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,520
And you figure if you can
make me decent and caring,
then maybe there's hope for...

527
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,760
You're about to tell a girl
she's dying and you think
it's about you.

528
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,120
God, I hope I'm not you.

529
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,480
I'm sorry.

530
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,440
Addie, you're dying.

531
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,080
Are you sure?

532
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,760
Yes.

533
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,000
Your infections will
get worse. The toxins will
spill into your blood.

534
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,440
How long?

535
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,720
Two days, maybe less.

536
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,080
You have a condition called...

537
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,000
Does it matter?

538
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,520
It's a very rare
protein deficiency
that only manifests...

539
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,200
I don't want to hear it.

540
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,520
Okay.

541
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,040
It's what's killing you.
This is what's killing you.

542
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,040
You're not interested
in what's killing you?

543
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,360
Will it make any difference?
Will I live any longer?

544
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,120
Please, could you just leave?

545
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,520
What's the point in living
without curiosity?
Without craving the...

546
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,720
So, I'm screwing up
my last few hours because
I won't listen to you?

547
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,160
Get out of here.

548
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,840
It's... It's like the
dark matter in the universe.

549
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,840
You're smiling.

550
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,040
No, I'm not.

551
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,400
You can only diagnose
a problem by looking
at what's...

552
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,200
Missing.

553
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,440
Oh, God.

554
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,720
I have to go.

555
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,720
Nineteen-year-old
didn't want to hear
the coolest explanation

556
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,880
of why she's going to die,
begged me to shut up.

557
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,040
If you can't shut up,
at least talk quietly.

558
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,200
Amphetamine withdrawal's
a bitch. She thought
that I was happy.

559
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,480
You were happy?
No, I was hazy.

560
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,520
And I don't get hazy
on Vicodin, or anything else
I throw down.

561
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,960
Which means
I was throwing down something

562
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,520
I didn't know I was
throwing down.
Which got me to wondering...

563
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,520
Why didn't you give me
those happy pills?

564
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,120
I told you.
You've got to be
checked out by...

565
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,560
No, you just didn't
want me double-dosing.

566
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,160
You dosed me!

567
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,520
Those coffees...
They worked!

568
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,200
You've been smiling,
relaxed, happy.

569
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,440
A dying girl thought
I was happy.

570
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,720
A moron thought I was happy.

571
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,320
Who the hell doesn't
want to know why she's dying?

572
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,440
House was happy.
Hazy.

573
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,480
Happy.
Hazy!

574
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,680
Oh, right.
A dying girl mistook
hazy for happy.

575
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Because dying people
see happiness everywhere.

576
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,560
She's miserable.
She wasn't miserable.

577
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,360
Of course she was miserable.
You just told her...

578
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,800
She was no different
than she'd ever been.

579
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,760
She was no different
than she'd ever been.

580
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,880
Oh, God.

581
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,200
I gotta go.

582
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,280
Need a minute
with your daughter.

583
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,920
Dr. House,
get out of here before...

584
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,680
She's gonna live.

585
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,840
Does that help? Now, get out.

586
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,920
Are you jerking us around...

587
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,520
Get out.

588
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,360
You have got
leprechauns in you.

589
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,480
Depression manifests
in lots of different ways.

590
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,560
Some people can't
get out of bed all day,

591
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,240
others have
serial relationships
and become oncologists.

592
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,720
I'm dying, I'm not depressed.

593
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,560
Wrong. And wrong.

594
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,720
You tried to kill yourself
by throwing down
kitchen cleanser.

595
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,360
Now, most normal
suicidal morons would have
just drank the stuff.

596
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Burned the hell out
of their mouth and throat.

597
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,640
<i>Painful, but not deadly.</i>

598
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
<i>But being a college-educated
suicidal moron,</i>

599
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,640
<i>you wrapped it in
gel caps or gum.</i>

600
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,200
Which left no trace,
but it burned a hole
in your intestine.

601
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,280
But the body can repair
almost anything,
which is cool.

602
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,320
In your case, scar tissue
closed up the hole.

603
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,840
<i>But it also formed a bridge
between a vein and an artery.</i>

604
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,800
Now, veins are supposed
to help the intestine
flush bacteria away.

605
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,320
<i>But the bridge allowed
the bacteria entrance
to the artery.</i>

606
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,520
Where they got
a free ride everywhere.

607
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,080
Can you fix me?

608
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,440
Surgery to fix the bridge'll
take about two hours.

609
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,280
The psychotherapy's
going to take a little longer.

610
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,200
Why'd you do it?

611
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,920
I don't know.

612
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,920
I've just

613
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,800
never been happy.

614
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,840
Please don't tell my parents.

615
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,920
They'll blame themselves
and it's not their fault.

616
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,840
Please, you can't tell them.

617
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,120
Technically, all you have
to do is promise me that
you won't do it again.

618
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,840
Then, legally,
I can't tell them.

619
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,360
I promise.

620
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,240
Yeah, sure.

621
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,560
We can't thank you...

622
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,000
Your daughter tried to
kill herself.

623
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,080
That's why she's here.

624
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,640
Legally, I'm supposed to
keep that between me and her.

625
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,000
Which makes sense,
she's obviously an adult,

626
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,800
capable of her own
well-reasoned decisions.

627
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,960
You're sure?

628
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,600
If she doesn't die
in the next couple of hours,

629
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,600
yeah, I'm right.

630
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,880
How could she hide this?

631
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,840
Everyone has secrets.

632
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,560
We'll take care of her.
Figure it out.

633
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,400
Make her happy?

634
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,080
We'll get her into therapy.

635
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,560
Might want to try
some meds, too.

636
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,760
Can we call you?

637
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,720
If we have any questions?

638
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,880
No.

639
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,200
What's up?
Nothing.

640
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,920
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

641
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,040
House's patient?
Yeah.

642
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,600
The one that would have died,
if not for him.

643
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,600
Subtle.
Thanks.

644
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,760
You're really scared
you'll turn into him.

645
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,280
Don't tell me
I'm better than him.

646
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,000
Don't tell me, take the good
and leave the bad.

647
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,600
Cameron already tried.

648
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,040
I'm telling you
there are worse things
to turn into.

649
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,440
It's not worth it.

650
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,000
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

651
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,960
I didn't think you were
going to show.

652
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,320
Sorry, surgery went
a little late.

653
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,400
So, you really think
I have all the necessary
qualifications?

654
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,600
I can't discuss this
with a dry mouth.
What do you got there?

655
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,280
Peppermint tea.

656
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm going to have
a mug of peppermint tea,
please.

657
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,720
This isn't a job interview,
is it?

658
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,000
It's some kind of interview.

659
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,520
You're judging me.
I'm judging you.

660
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,040
You have the upper hand.

661
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,920
I don't know anything
about you.

662
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,800
I'm on antidepressants

663
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,880
because a doctor friend
of mine thinks I'm miserable.

664
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,520
I don't like them,
they make me hazy.
I eat meat, I like drugs.

665
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,360
And I'm not always faithful
to the women I date.

666
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,120
You don't seem depressed.

667
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,960
You do realize you just
skipped over several
deep character flaws

668
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,600
that most women would
run screaming from.

669
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,200
You told the truth.

670
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Yeah, I don't always do that,
either.

671
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,320
Well, how miserable
can you be,

672
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,000
saving lives, sleeping around,
and doing drugs?

673
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,880
Were you on the debating team
in high school?

674
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,720
Also, I hate

675
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,320
tea.
