1
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,825
It's estimated
the observable universe

2
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,812
is 93 billion light-years across.

3
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:46,869
- It's probably more accure...
- I'm gonna be so far away.

4
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:50,265
I don't care.
I don't want to break up.

5
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:51,969
I'll come on the weekends.

6
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,268
Stanford's on the other side
of the country.

7
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:57,835
My dad has, like, ten million
frequent flyer miles. He won't care.

8
00:01:07,428 --> 00:01:10,624
- Are we all right over here?
- Yes, Mr. Damon.

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,080
I just had something
caught in my throat.

10
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,658
You're not supposed
to have any food or drinks in here.

11
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:18,494
It's just water. I have a cough.
I didn't want to disturb anyone.

12
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:22,540
We can only observe
4% of the universe.

13
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:24,615
The rest of it is unaccounted for.

14
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,753
I never knew
you were such a good liar.

15
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,756
More vodka, and you might find out
some things you didn't know about me.

16
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,304
Really?

17
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,672
- Nicholas.
- Yes, sir?

18
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:37,554
What conclusions can we draw
from the incredible number of stars?

19
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:41,142
That the movie's either gonna be
really good or really bad.

20
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:44,932
I was thinking more
about the implications

21
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:46,857
for extraterrestrial life.

22
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:51,152
I guess if there's
an infinite number of stars,

23
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:54,238
odds are there's at least one galaxy
with life other than our own.

24
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:55,496
Or?

25
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:57,995
Or... not?

26
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,840
Or our solar system
is somehow unique.

27
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,791
The question then becomes,
"in what way?"

28
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:08,633
The question then becomes, "could you
teach us anything more useless?"

29
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,520
What are you looking at?

30
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:19,597
My God. Something's wrong.
She's not breathing.

31
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:24,466
Call 911.

35
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,790
Would you mind at least putting a napkin
under your jelly toast?

36
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:20,264
Get a table,
and I won't eat it on the couch.

37
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:21,589
Yes, you will.

38
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:24,033
But I won't have a good excuse.

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,590
Why don't you go get a table?

40
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,107
Not my condo.

41
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,854
You have my permission.
Pick out whatever you want.

42
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,881
It would be a reflection of me,
not you. That wouldn't be right.

43
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,437
It would be a reflection of the fact

44
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:40,428
that the guy who's been mooching off
of me for as long as I can remember

45
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,430
isn't a complete ingrate.

46
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:48,353
You've never furnished a home.

47
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:50,438
I have furnished a bunch of homes.

48
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:53,900
No, you've married a bunch of women
who furnished a bunch of homes.

49
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,862
You want to eat off something? Fine.
Move your piano in here, eat off that.

50
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:02,032
- You're afraid.
- Of a dining table?

51
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,353
You know,
they don't actually come to life

52
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,704
when you put a knob
off your bedpost on them.

53
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,567
You are what you sit in.

54
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:12,376
Your friends, your job,
your furnishings... It all defines you.

55
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,923
You don't really believe that.
You just don't want to do the shopping.

56
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:18,731
Buy some furniture,

57
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,171
or admit that you're empty inside.

58
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:34,407
X-rays confirm the fluid
that almost suffocated her to death

59
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:35,851
was from pulmonary edema.

60
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,127
Means the problem
is either in her heart or lungs.

61
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:40,496
Tox screen's clean for everything
except the alcohol,

62
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:42,536
and her B.A.C. was barely .05.

63
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:44,974
That means she only had
one or two drinks, tops.

64
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:47,099
And there's no sign of trauma.

65
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,184
How'd you know?

66
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:52,416
Because if there was, Cuddy wouldn't
have needed me to take the case.

67
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,910
- How do you...
- Foreman's the only one with the balls

68
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:58,052
to take a case without checking with me,
and he's still working on breakfast,

69
00:04:58,177 --> 00:04:59,730
which means that the...

70
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:03,044
18...

71
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,096
No, 17-year-old honor student...

72
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:07,890
Cuddy has a soft spot

73
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:10,518
for smart girls,
and they don't start drinking

74
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,907
until second semester, senior year.

75
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:15,048
So either you think that smart women

76
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:17,423
look out for each other,
which means you're an idiot,

77
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,610
or you think Cuddy's not smart,
which means...

78
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,697
- I guess it's the same both ways.
- Then how did you...

79
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,416
Picture fell out of the file.
She looks smart.

80
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,827
- Where's Taub?
- You don't already know?

81
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:31,696
He's at home in a fight with his wife.
I'm curious what he wanted me to know.

82
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,916
His car has a flat tire.
He's waiting for a tow truck.

83
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:37,086
What about rising blood pressure
from binge drinking?

84
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,505
It could set off a hypertensive crisis,
cause heart failure.

85
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,884
- Two drinks is hardly a binge.
- Certainly not if you're an Aussie.

86
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,489
But when an American schoolgirl
has two drinks before 10:00 am,

87
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:49,390
it's a pretty sure bet
that the plan is to have a lot more.

88
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,142
Probably wasn't the first time.

89
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,896
We'll get a C-13-pyruvate MRI
to check for cardiac lactic-acid levels.

90
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:56,577
Someone call Taub.

91
00:05:56,702 --> 00:05:59,400
Tell him to cut the ball
and chain on his own time.

92
00:05:59,865 --> 00:06:01,824
We're arguing about couples yoga?

93
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:05,740
We're arguing because we don't ever do
anything together anymore.

94
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:08,117
We don't ever do anything together?

95
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,287
I love you, but I swear,
if you start talking to me

96
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,705
like I'm on the witness stand again,
I break your neck.

97
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,957
- We do stuff together all the time.
- Really? Like what?

98
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,871
Besides sleeping, watching TV,
going out to dinner,

99
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,422
what do we do together,

100
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,810
just the two of us?

101
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:23,935
We...

102
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:28,268
You don't like going out to dinner?

103
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,390
All right, I'll do the yoga.

104
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,074
- Forget it.
- Now you don't want me to do it?

105
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,645
Go to work.

106
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,315
I'm not leaving
until we work this out.

107
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm fine.

108
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:41,833
Please,

109
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:42,777
just go.

110
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:08,165
Where's Abby Nash?

111
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:11,931
I'm Nick, her boyfriend.
This is my dad.

112
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:14,642
- You can wait in...
- Where is she?

113
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:16,395
Is she okay?

114
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,833
- She's having some tests run.
- Is she okay?

115
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,820
We think her drinking
may have damaged her heart.

116
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:28,449
Her heart?

117
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,577
- She doesn't drink, not that much.
- Just when she's at school?

118
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,288
Nick, what's he talking about?

119
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:38,073
It was a field trip.
One of the kids had a fake I.D.

120
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:42,253
- But, Dad, you know Abby. Tell him.
- I know her when you're with me...

121
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:45,352
If you're right,
the tests will come back negative.

122
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:47,408
Can you give her a message?

123
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,327
I brought her homework...

124
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:51,702
and I love her.

125
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:08,318
Sorry I'm late.

126
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,458
Nick loves you.

127
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:16,489
House doesn't believe
you got a flat tire.

128
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,831
- What does he think I was doing?
- Fighting with the wife.

129
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,894
Why would I lie about that?

130
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:25,098
She wants me to do yoga.

131
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,575
We need thinner cuts.

132
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:34,924
When you and Cameron
had disagreements...

133
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,999
I'm probably not the best guy

134
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,685
- to go to for marital advice.
- Sorry.

135
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,857
- Punch in to the mitral valve.
- All right, I get the message.

136
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,079
No, I'm serious.

137
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:49,375
What is that?

138
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:03,682
Could be a fungus.

139
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:07,158
E.R. drew blood cultures...
all negative, no parasites, no fungus.

140
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,284
It could be fastidious
enteric bacteria.

141
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,042
You think she's been eating
your wife's cooking?

142
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,346
I'm on your side, man.

143
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,391
I am not fighting with my wife.
I had a flat tire. It's in my trunk.

144
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,160
- You can go look at it if you want.
- Don't need to.

145
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:22,963
Face tells me you're bluffing.

146
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:26,732
- Not yours... Chase's.
- If she was infected

147
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:29,068
through the intestinal tract,
she'd have symptoms.

148
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:31,737
There are other ways to get bacteria
into the bloodstream.

149
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,240
She's not an intravenous drug user,
she has no tattoos,

150
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,450
and no scars
that would indicate she's not a cutter.

151
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,585
Transesophageal echo could give us
a better idea of what we're looking at.

152
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,665
If that valve is about to dehisce,
echo could trigger a heart attack.

153
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,220
So come up with a better idea
or have a crash cart ready.

154
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:53,393
Why are you lying to House?

155
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:57,430
- Chase told me. What's the big deal?
- We can talk about this another time...

156
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,421
Or never.

157
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:00,670
I really don't think
she's gonna tell anyone.

158
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:03,853
If I admit we're fighting,
he's gonna want to know what about.

159
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,439
So tell him,
or tell him it's none of his business.

160
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:10,401
- This is easier.
- Really? Because it seems much harder.

161
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:12,422
What do I know?
I'm not a guy.

162
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:15,739
If only I could be as open
about my emotional life as you are.

163
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:20,299
- It's not about the yoga.
- Really? I thought it was,

164
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:23,550
since we spent an hour talking about it,
but what do I know? I'm not a girl.

165
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:25,932
My guess is she thinks
you don't want to spend time with her

166
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,151
because you're spending it
with someone else.

167
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:30,796
If she thinks I'm cheating,
she would ask.

168
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:32,584
Because you'd tell the truth?

169
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:35,926
- I'm not seeing anyone else.
- Doesn't matter. You have a history.

170
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,960
- And that's not her fault.
- So what am I supposed to do?

171
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,057
- I can't prove a negative.
- That is a problem.

172
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,592
There's the heart.

173
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,982
Valves look fine...
No vegetations, no myxomatous changes.

174
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,537
Can you give her
a little more sedative?

175
00:10:57,644 --> 00:11:00,034
- She's dissecting.
- She's rupturing. Get the scope out.

176
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:05,624
This doesn't make sense. B.P. is normal,
her heart rate was controlled.

177
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,251
We'll figure it out later. We've only
got about 30 seconds to get her open.

178
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:13,188
No leakage from cannulation site.

179
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:14,313
Nice.

180
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:17,725
- Let's see if she'll start up.
- Cardiac paddle.

181
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,127
Charging.

182
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,127
And go.

183
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:25,476
- Come on.
- Again.

184
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:26,984
Go.

185
00:11:27,943 --> 00:11:29,772
Pushing five CCs adrenaline.

186
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,276
Zap her again.

187
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:43,701
It's not working.
Clear.

188
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,247
Clear.

189
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,792
Normal sinus rhythm.

190
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:53,827
Thank God.

191
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:10,268
TEE
and intra-operative visualization

192
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:12,274
showed no vegetation on the valves.

193
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,217
No structural abnormalities.

194
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:16,340
The dissection
means alcohol didn't cause

195
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:17,779
the hypertensive crisis.

196
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,527
By "we", you mean "you".

197
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,197
You didn't have any better ideas.

198
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:24,619
It's not my fault.
I was busy trying to judge Taub.

199
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,072
Since we already ruled out trauma,
the dissection is probably genetic.

200
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:32,127
- She's not marfanoid.
- What about an allergy?

201
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,797
A severe enough one could set off
a systemic immune reaction,

202
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:37,299
cause fluids in the lungs

203
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,258
and inflammation
weakening the aorta.

204
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,221
If it was an allergy,
she'd be getting better, not worse.

205
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,847
Unless it was inside her.

206
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,067
Meaning?

207
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:50,697
You want my sperm?

208
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:54,635
We think a severe allergic reaction
could be causing systemic breakdown.

209
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,160
To my son's sperm?

210
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:58,195
His semen
is more likely the problem.

211
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,103
Which I realize is not
what you were reacting to.

212
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:04,367
When's the last time
you had unprotected sex?

213
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:08,306
Never, I use a condom.

214
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:10,957
You always use a condom?
For everything?

215
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,755
- For most everything.
- When?

216
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:18,809
The night before she collapsed.

217
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:24,210
I'm placing a drop of Nick's
semen protein onto the skin.

218
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:28,328
Then I'll abrade it with a needle,
check for a rash in an hour or so.

219
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:34,231
Mom, come on...
We've been dating for three years.

220
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,478
I'm not mad, sweetheart.

221
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:38,382
I'm just confused.

222
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:42,212
A systemic reaction can be triggered
by the protein in semen.

223
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:45,575
In most cases,
the reaction is fairly minor.

224
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:47,077
But in rare cases,

225
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:50,494
repeat exposure can trigger
a hypersensitivity response.

226
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:52,207
Repeat exposure?

227
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,181
I know, I know, three years.

228
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,671
Is it supposed to hurt?

229
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,842
- The reaction should take longer...
- No, it's not that.

230
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,718
- What's wrong?
- My stomach.

231
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,160
Blood in the urine.

232
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,440
No allergic reaction.
But, her kidneys are failing.

233
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:21,996
Could be some kind of neuropathy.
Syphilitic lightning pains?

234
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:23,638
It's not syphilis.

235
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:26,822
VDRL and enzyme immunoassays
were negative.

236
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:28,368
Blood clot?

237
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,745
While she's on anticoagulants
from the surgery?

238
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,413
Interstitial nephritis?

239
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,611
Wouldn't cause the edema
or dissection.

240
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,084
But cancer could.

241
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,878
Would you care to be more specific?

242
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,839
If I could, I would have.

243
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:44,134
We could do a full-body scan.

244
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,303
We hate full-body scans.

245
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,389
And by "we" you mean "you".

246
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:51,421
We also hate when a patient dies

247
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:53,560
before we figure out
what's wrong with them.

248
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:57,803
Do the scan.

249
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,851
How can you convince someone
you're not cheating?

250
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:04,076
Don't cheat.

251
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:07,303
- After a while, they'll catch on.
- What if I don't want to wait?

252
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,492
Take them with you for 24 hours.

253
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:12,662
So your wife's a little insecure.
Is that so bad?

254
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:14,998
You know she still cares.

255
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:16,687
I know she cares.

256
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,414
What I want is for her to be happy.

257
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:23,882
What?

258
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:26,381
You don't think
I want my wife to be happy?

259
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:27,506
Sure...

260
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:29,304
As long as it makes you happy.

261
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,552
What do you think?

262
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:06,162
I think you work quickly.

263
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:07,976
Piece of cake.

264
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,998
Give them money,
they give you furniture.

265
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,662
Not bad, huh?

266
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:15,758
It's not bad at all.

267
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:29,036
It's taking a really long time.

268
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:31,657
<i>Just hang in there and try not to talk
unless you have to.</i>

269
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,318
<i>It can affect the images.</i>

270
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:35,995
What was that?

271
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:37,831
Are you still there?

272
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:43,427
There's something wrong
with the machine.

273
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,575
<i>It's not the machine,
it's an earthquake.</i>

274
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,923
<i>We'll get you out.</i>

275
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,341
Get me out now.

276
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,763
Oh, my God!

277
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,383
I can't hold on!

278
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:44,862
- It's a black hole.
- She's hallucinating.

279
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:46,487
I certainly hope so.

280
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:51,812


281
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:57,322
Hallucination means brain problem.

282
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,277
Brain problems
don't split your aorta.

283
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:03,039
A vascular problem
could explain both.

284
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,282
Inflammation
in the blood-vessel walls

285
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:07,202
leads to dissection in the aorta

286
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:10,789
and could cause an aneurysm in the brain
that could cause the visions.

287
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:12,514
It's a bit convoluted,

288
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,886
but brain and heart function
are susceptible.

289
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,097
If there was any sign
of inflammation,

290
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:18,847
that would make sense.

291
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:01,082
It's not funny.

292
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,288
- I got enough problems already.
- Trust me, this is gonna help.

293
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,147
An aneurysm
explains the hallucinations.

294
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:10,149
It's the one thing we haven't excluded
from the differential.

295
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,527
Your texting
doesn't prove you're faithful.

296
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,155
Just proves you know she thinks
you're unfaithful.

297
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:17,112
Can't force trust.

298
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,200
What did she hallucinate?

299
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:22,464
The content of the hallucination
isn't relevant.

300
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:24,439
- Not usually.
- Not ever.

301
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:27,793
We know nothing, brain knows all.

302
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:29,971
You get an ulcer, you don't know it,

303
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:32,178
but the brain
increases mucin secretions.

304
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:34,883
It knows what the problem is,
where the problem is.

305
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:37,508
It's a big logical jump
from a body's immune response

306
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:39,804
to the brain giving
subconscious diagnostic clues.

307
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,932
What about dreaming about waterfalls,
if you need to go to the bathroom?

308
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,102
That's the same as the brain shouting,
"You have cancer".

309
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:49,321
Her subconscious is trying
to tell her something.

310
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:50,996
We need to eavesdrop.

311
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:54,515
She was screaming
she was being sucked into a black hole,

312
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,654
so we should look for a tumor
in her anus?

313
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,663
We need the whole story.

314
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:01,367
The cognitive pattern
recognition program

315
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,703
might tell us
what's going on in her head.

316
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:07,794
Or we could act on something

317
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,584
based on science, not sci-fi.

318
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,879
Get an MRA with contrast
to see if she has an aneurysm,

319
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,465
unless you think Cuddy's gonna go
for the mind reading.

320
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:17,342
Fine, do the MRA.

321
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,886
When it comes back negative,
we can move on to the...

322
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,657
Crazy but possible ideas.

323
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,133
What did you do with the furniture?

324
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,807
I returned it.

325
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:08,435
You told me to buy it.

326
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,062
But you didn't buy it.
You rented it.

327
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:13,806
You made one phone call

328
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,424
"Economy furniture supply".

329
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:18,999
"We get it done
so you don't have to."

330
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:21,711
So what? We had a table, chairs...

331
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:23,450
But no clue what any of it meant.

332
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,994
Fine, I'll hire a decorator.

333
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,470
Perfect.

334
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:30,457
- Another woman to tell you who you are.
- I'll hire a male decorator.

335
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:34,002
Step inside one furniture store
and find one thing you like.

336
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,080
I like not doing this.

337
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:37,922
One.

338
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:56,312
Where's my mom?

339
00:21:57,373 --> 00:21:59,461
She went down to get some breakfast.

340
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,800
How are you feeling?

341
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,624
Well, besides the fact
that I can barely breathe

342
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:07,249
and I ache all over,

343
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:08,374
not good.

344
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:11,837
Anything I can do?

345
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:14,589
Just don't go.

346
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:17,498
I'm not going anywhere.

347
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:35,458
Been a while since we've gone
more than a day without doing that.

348
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,856
<i>Not going anywhere.</i>

349
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:40,344
What'd you say?

350
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,370
I've been thinking.

351
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:47,200
<i>Been a long time since we went
more than a day without doing that.</i>

352
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,395
We have a secret.

353
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:05,278
You don't need to answer right now.

354
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:11,975
Abby, I want to marry you.

355
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:17,063
Tell him.

356
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:18,914
It's okay.

357
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,411
Something's wrong.

358
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:27,107
- What are you feeling?
- I don't know.

359
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,616
Your secret is killing you.

360
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:29,784
I see...

361
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:32,501
Maybe it's all the medication.

362
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:33,676
I'm just...

363
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:41,155
Can you hear me?

364
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,730
You deserve to die.

365
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,342
Four milligrams of lorazepam.

366
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:50,949


367
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,178
She seized for over a minute.

368
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:04,303
Inner-ictal EEG
showed no synchronous discharges.

369
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:06,083
And the MRA?

370
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:10,027
No aneurysms or arterial
or venous malformations in the brain.

371
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:11,357
As predicted.

372
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,306
What did we say we'd move on to?

373
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:16,368
Out-of-body experiences
can be induced

374
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:18,750
by sensory overload
in the temporoparietal junction.

375
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:22,378
Which was clean on MRI,
MRA, and whole-body scan.

376
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:25,643
Which just leaves us
with the question

377
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,468
of what happened
during the out-of-body experience.

378
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,500
If I say her BP shot up over 200
and she bit her tongue,

379
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,407
would that be a satisfactory answer?

380
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:37,384
Sure. If you then went on
to answer the following...

381
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,813
Did she float above her body?
Did she see Jesus?

382
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:41,745
Did she bathe in the Ganges?

383
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,901
No, no, and no.
Can we get back to the medical science?

384
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:48,120
She claims she emerged from her body

385
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:50,448
as a younger version of herself
and started talking.

386
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:52,548
She couldn't remember
what was discussed.

387
00:24:52,673 --> 00:24:54,873
I'm sure it wasn't a differential.

388
00:24:55,163 --> 00:24:56,678
Cognitive pattern recognition

389
00:24:56,803 --> 00:24:58,873
is 50 years
from being a diagnostic tool.

390
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:02,178
Even if we can get the equipment,
it takes hours for the initial mapping.

391
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:03,853
She could stroke out.

392
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:07,132
Coincidentally, she could also
have a stroke if we do nothing.

393
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,611
I'm not telling a mother
who's scared out of her mind

394
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:11,356
our best shot is a magic trick.

395
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:13,695
It's not magical, it's experimental.

396
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,808
Just like washing your hands
after pooping once was.

397
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:20,061
Technically, it's not our best shot,
it's our only shot.

398
00:25:23,442 --> 00:25:24,442
Perfect.

399
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:26,025
Foreman, get her consent.

400
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:28,570
The rest of you go down
to the cog sci lab.

401
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:30,697
Equipment should already be there.

402
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:42,049
I'll catch up.

403
00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:49,364
Thanks for the invite.

404
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:51,259
Not sure I'm up
for the hospital food.

405
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,720
Good,
'cause I wasn't planning on lunch.

406
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:57,738
While you watch video clips,

407
00:25:57,863 --> 00:26:00,518
a computer maps how your brain
processes the images.

408
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,701
How long will it take?

409
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:05,064
Six hours.
But that's really just the prep.

410
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:08,358
Once the computer maps
how she processes the information,

411
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,944
we'll put her under sedation,

412
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,406
use the same equipment to monitor
her unconscious thoughts.

413
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:17,243
Hopefully, it'll spit out a basic video
of what's going on in her head.

414
00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:19,404
What will that tell you?

415
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:21,114
Hopefully, it'll give us a clue

416
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:23,124
as to where your brain
thinks the problem is.

417
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:26,294
- A lot of "hopefullys".
- Could it hurt her?

418
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:31,174
We're at a diagnostic dead end.
We gotta try something.

419
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:41,267
This is much better than lunch.

420
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:43,624
I agree.

421
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:49,359
What made you think of this?

422
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:50,857
I missed you.

423
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:52,737
No, I mean this...

424
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,782
car, in the parking lot.

425
00:26:57,287 --> 00:26:59,994
I don't like feeling maybe this
isn't the first time you've done this.

426
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:01,667
It's the first.

427
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:04,124
I love you.
You know that, right?

428
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:11,614
I want you to be able to trust me.

429
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:13,837
And I want to, but...

430
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:23,852
Inspiration point
doesn't open till after dark.

431
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:27,021
<i>Got a real cool magic show</i>
<i>about to start.</i>

432
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,308
Also, I'm gonna need
to check your spare.

433
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,818
<i>Abby, can you think
of something specific?</i>

434
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:02,284
Like what?

435
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:04,577
Doesn't matter.
Just make it a single image.

436
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:25,955
- What are you thinking?
- About Nick playing baseball.

437
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:27,844
Holy crap.

438
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:29,501
That's amazing.

439
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:33,005
Now all we have to do
is read her subconscious

440
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,046
and hope that it's completely rational
and went to med school.

441
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,009
Does anything get you excited?

442
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:52,747
Can I help you with something?

443
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:57,904
I was wondering if you could tell me
a little bit about this dining table.

444
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:01,152
It's made of wood,
and you eat off it.

445
00:29:01,946 --> 00:29:04,516
- So you're paid by commission?
- It's furniture.

446
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:07,273
Find something you like.
Let me know. I'll ring it up.

447
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:09,872
Thank you so much.

448
00:29:40,132 --> 00:29:42,332
Okay, that's... that's not the one.

449
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:51,258
That is a remarkable collection,
if I can show it to you.

450
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:52,583
I'm Gabriella.

451
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:56,712
I'm really just looking
for a nice dining-room table.

452
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:59,132
I see.
You're daring.

453
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:02,660
Yes, I do that sometimes, but...

454
00:30:03,738 --> 00:30:05,513
Right now why am I daring?

455
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,723
You're not constrained by rules.

456
00:30:08,361 --> 00:30:10,226
What attracts you
in the patio section?

457
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:14,605
Wait, this is a patio tab...
For outside?

458
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,709
Well, it's taken us
just over an hour

459
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:37,627
to prove that she has
a very boring subconscious.

460
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,631
Anyone ever tell you
you can be a real buzzkill?

461
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:45,053
Stars?

462
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:48,065
Maybe that's a stripe?

463
00:30:49,272 --> 00:30:50,433
It's the sky.

464
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,520
She's thinking about the moon
and the stars and the sky.

465
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,600
She's going to Stanford
to study physics.

466
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:58,941
It's not a big revelation
that she'd think about the sky.

467
00:30:59,377 --> 00:31:02,028
Or...
star could be a white blood cell.

468
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Leukemia?

469
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:10,155
Who's that?

470
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:12,872
Her dad?
He died when she was eight.

471
00:31:13,182 --> 00:31:14,498
What did daddy die of?

472
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,084
Private-plane crash, no connection.

473
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:20,397
Stars, moon, sky,

474
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:22,929
white blood cells, heart valves,

475
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:24,468
black holes, or anus

476
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,220
or a million other circular
passageways into the body

477
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:28,804
and her dad.

478
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:30,672
What do you think it means?

479
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:34,433
She likes school,
and she has daddy issues...

480
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:37,563
Neither of which helps us.

481
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:43,976
So now what do we do?
Start over?

482
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,521
We obviously missed something.

483
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:49,116
- What about the liver?
- What about her left toe?

484
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:52,936
Sorry, I thought we were randomly
picking out body parts

485
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:54,830
that had nothing to do
with her symptoms.

486
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:56,832
Liver's responsible for proteins,

487
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:59,335
immunological effects,
production of red blood cells.

488
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,922
Might be able to explain the lungs,
the hallucinations.

489
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,548
Not the aortic dissection.

490
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:07,104
Kidneys are also failing.

491
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:10,956
We add in polycystic disease,
could explain the dissection.

492
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:14,475
So that's one imperfect theory,
plus a rare complication

493
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:17,859
of a second theory, which gives us
a complete explanation.

494
00:32:19,944 --> 00:32:21,644
Don't polish the notion.

495
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,188
Pineal gland is calcified.

496
00:32:25,313 --> 00:32:28,118
It'supposed to be calcified.
Happens after puberty.

497
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:30,293
What if it's obscuring a tumor?

498
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:33,325
It's the only place
we couldn't look inside.

499
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:37,123
Get a better look at her pineal gland
with three Tesla fast spin echo MRI.

500
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:48,371
You're pacing my office
'cause you're buying furniture?

501
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:49,709
I'm pacing your office

502
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,297
`cause I'm physically
incapable of buying furniture.

503
00:32:52,422 --> 00:32:53,764
For Amber's old place?

504
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,247
- It needs some new...
- I know you bought the place I wanted.

505
00:32:59,372 --> 00:33:01,731
You're a jerk. Let's move on.
Hire a decorator.

506
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,067
I'm supposed to find me.

507
00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:06,944
Backpack through Europe.

508
00:33:07,602 --> 00:33:08,904
It's hard to believe,

509
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,615
but you know what says even more
about who you are than your furniture?

510
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,536
The fact that you are letting House
tell you how to buy furniture.

511
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,406
Call Beatrice.

512
00:33:31,365 --> 00:33:34,503
MRI revealed no remarkable features
on her pineal gland.

513
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:38,267
But there were slightly elevated levels
of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes.

514
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:42,495
Which we would expect to see
if there was an allergic reaction.

515
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,106
There's definitely no allergy.

516
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:48,853
Parasite?
There's this middle eastern...

517
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:51,072
How exactly
do you want to be shot down?

518
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:52,740
On the basis of the fact

519
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:55,397
that she's never been within
6,000 miles of the middle east,

520
00:33:55,522 --> 00:33:57,411
or on the basis of the fact
that all our scans

521
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,351
and urine samples came back clean?

522
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:03,631
And yet she's still failing,

523
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:05,256
system after system.

524
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,581
So either we find the answer
at autopsy

525
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,121
or...

526
00:34:16,863 --> 00:34:17,691
What?

527
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:22,937
I got nothin'.

528
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,539


529
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:03,857
I was gonna head out.

530
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:06,389
If there's any change,
I assume you'll page me?

531
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:09,545
Are you having an affair?

532
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,608
Does it bother you that your wife

533
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:17,158
doesn't have the guts
to actually ask that question, and I do?

534
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:19,229
On both ends, yes.

535
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:21,866
Difference is,
I'm not afraid of the answer.

536
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:23,498
And I might believe you.

537
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:26,251
- I'm not having an affair.
- But you want to.

538
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:29,739
No, I don't.
I'm through living like that.

539
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:30,765
Why?

540
00:35:31,716 --> 00:35:33,220
You finally got to the point

541
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:35,885
where half your age plus seven
just isn't young enough?

542
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,146
Talk to you later, House.

543
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:41,540
Or is it because you now really
are old enough to be their...

544
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:46,758
The dad.

545
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:50,525
Does he travel for work?

546
00:35:51,596 --> 00:35:54,028
What do you mean, "does he"?
He died almost ten years ago.

547
00:35:55,928 --> 00:35:57,802
Not hers, her boyfriend's.

548
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:02,428
He's the one in her visions.

549
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:09,477
I'm your son's girlfriend's doctor.

550
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,841
It's a mouthful, but probably not
as tricky as your title.

551
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,053
- Is Abby gonna be all right?
- Do you travel a lot?

552
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:21,222
I have a food-import business. Why?

553
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:22,783
Where'd you go?

554
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:25,894
All over, France, Italy,
the Mediterranean. Why?

555
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,855
I think you exposed her
to a parasite.

556
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:34,611
- I thought the scans didn't show any.
- Because she doesn't have any.

557
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:37,403
- But you just said.
- It's cool.

558
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:41,527
My theory is that her body
was able to kill off the parasite,

559
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,264
but what it couldn't do
was get rid of the shell,

560
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:47,332
which doesn't show up on the scans.

561
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,285
That little piece
of microscopic garbage

562
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:52,413
set off an allergic reaction

563
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:55,100
called cerebellar schistosomiasis

564
00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:57,342
delayed hypersensitivity allergy,

565
00:36:57,702 --> 00:36:59,489
or cusdehaaa.

566
00:37:00,673 --> 00:37:03,181
Risky, unpleasant treatment,
but completely curable.

567
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:05,266
That's fantastic.

568
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:07,912
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
Only thing is,

569
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,556
did you ever have sex
with your son's girlfriend?

570
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:16,569
- Where the hell do you get off ask...
- Shut up.

571
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,908
See, I can't treat this
unless I can confirm it,

572
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,244
the only way she could've been exposed
to this parasite is sexually,

573
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:28,790
which means she's gonna die soon unless
you admit that you slept with her.

574
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:34,266
Dad?

575
00:37:34,634 --> 00:37:36,848
- What's going on?
- Gee, this is bad,

576
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:39,408
because you now have to choose
between her living

577
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,511
and the truth becoming public.

578
00:37:41,817 --> 00:37:43,763
And frankly,
given what the truth is,

579
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,799
it's a tough call.

580
00:37:50,147 --> 00:37:51,447
You'd broken up.

581
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:53,147
She was crying.

582
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:55,971
Your girlfriend
is not allergic to your semen.

583
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,089
She's allergic
to the Egyptian parasite

584
00:37:58,214 --> 00:37:59,904
swimming around in your dad's semen.

585
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,058
- You slept with Abby?
- I was drunk.

586
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:08,721
We both...

587
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:10,832
No need to explain.
Technically, she was legal.

588
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,045
Wait, wait, wait.

589
00:38:19,578 --> 00:38:22,456
All things considered,
it's actually great news.

590
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:39,427
So what do you think?

591
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:42,655
You wussed out,
and you used a decorator.

592
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:44,239
Why can't that be me?

593
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:47,118
- The wuss who loves decorators?
- 'Cause it's not.

594
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:48,520
Okay. It's not.

595
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:51,122
But don't return it.
I can't keep doing this.

596
00:38:51,694 --> 00:38:52,794
You have to.

597
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:55,825
You can't keep
letting other people define you.

598
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,679
Not another elephant.

599
00:39:17,473 --> 00:39:19,167
Decorator didn't pick this.

600
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:21,928
You're gonna have to buy
your own cape.

601
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,096
I like what this says
about you, Wilson.

602
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:08,901
I don't remember him at the wedding.
Do you?

603
00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:11,721
I don't remember most of the people
who were at our wedding.

604
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:16,715
Which is why...

605
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:22,215
I thought I'd ask the love of my life
to marry me.

606
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:26,360
We're already married.

607
00:41:28,077 --> 00:41:29,906
I want to be better at it.

608
00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:35,953
It's beautiful.

609
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:06,396
What'd you tell him?

610
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,903
That it doesn't mean
she doesn't love him.

611
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:11,779
And he bought it?

612
00:42:13,273 --> 00:42:14,273
It's true.

613
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:20,517
Your wife say yes?

614
00:42:22,388 --> 00:42:24,642
- How did you know...
- Monkey see, monkey do.

615
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,673
At least he has
the young and stupid excuse.

616
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,330
She said yes.

617
00:42:33,728 --> 00:42:34,878
Good for you.
