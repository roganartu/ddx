1
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:22,513
Okay.

2
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:24,822
"Therafy" me.

3
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:34,592
You're late.

4
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:36,867
You're fat.

5
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,614
It's unusual.

6
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:42,923
You know how far
the parking lot is?

7
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,463
My leg's been hurting.

8
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:46,202
Anything been on your mind lately,

9
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:48,242
any particular stress?

10
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:50,685
No. Probably just gonna rain.

11
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,760
Mm-hmm. You like the
new Monet reproduction

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,835
in the waiting room--

13
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,708
<i>the Water Lilies?</i>

14
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,482
I was late.

15
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:00,757
I wasn't focusing on the decor,

16
00:01:00,757 --> 00:01:04,170
but it sounds appropriately
bland and calming.

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,546
<i>Stress can also make you absentminded.</i>

18
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,788
I'm not stressed...

19
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:10,561
Beyond the stress induced

20
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:13,840
by you telling me
how stressed I am.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,446
Just an ordinary week.

22
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:19,578
Okay.

23
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:23,309
Tell me about it.

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,495
<i>I had a patient.</i>

25
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:29,217
<i>House.</i>

26
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:33,615
Good. I have a case for you.

27
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,555
Beer?

28
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,060
Amnesia.

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,804
She was found jogging in
the street, disoriented.

30
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:42,013
She almost got hit by a truck.

31
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,317
The MRI showed no abnormalities.

32
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:45,558
<i>No I.D. on her.</i>

33
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:48,404
<i>Just her jogging clothes and
her heart rate monitor.</i>

34
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:49,876
We know absolutely
nothing about her.

35
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,715
We know she has money.

36
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:54,894
Blaze outriggers-
400 bucks a pair.

37
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:57,036
<i>People who have money don't
just disappear.</i>

38
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:59,043
Sooner or later, someone's
gonna show up looking for her.

39
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:00,917
Can I have something to eat?

40
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:02,691
She just ate 15 minutes ago.

41
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:04,229
She keeps forgetting.

42
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,308
You don't eat because you
remember it's time to eat.

43
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:08,880
You eat 'cause you're hungry.

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,692
Her metabolism is in high gear.

45
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,368
She is an extreme
long-distance runner--

46
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,409
<i>Why were you in the ER?</i>

47
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,354
That's your question?

48
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:20,993
You're a psychotherapist.

49
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:22,766
You're hearing about
a great amnesia case,

50
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,540
and all you're asking
me is geography.

51
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,049
Just curious.

52
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,938
I was avoiding Wilson.

53
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:35,883
It's not something you
couldn't have seen

54
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:38,090
eight miles away.

55
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>Wilson's a processor.</i>

56
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,206
<i>I knew there were some things</i>

57
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:44,281
<i>that he'd want to process with me...</i>

58
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,585
<i>At length.</i>

59
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:49,065
Sam's moving in.

60
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,440
If it's before Friday,
your assistant wins the pool.

61
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,490
I was just wondering
what your plans were.

62
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,995
Tonight?

63
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:57,958
In life.

64
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,479
Sam likes you...

65
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,319
But she wants me to move out.

66
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,072
No.

67
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,769
I want you to move out.

68
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,483
I didn't know things with
Sam would happen so quickly.

69
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,654
I didn't--

70
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:14,294
I don't want to
make a mistake here.

71
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,699
I've made a lot of mistakes.

72
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,071
By moving too quickly.

73
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,911
Given your usual
rate of commitment,

74
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:22,525
I'm surprised you're not
already re-divorced.

75
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,767
I could help you find a place.

76
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:26,674
What's wrong with my old place?

77
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,046
Nothing. I just thought...

78
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:30,656
You might want to
find somewhere new,

79
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:33,131
somewhere...

80
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,645
Where I didn't abuse
drugs and hallucinate.

81
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:37,648
Yes.

82
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,460
I'm fine.

83
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,100
<i>You're fine?</i>

84
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,207
Your best friend
is tossing you out,

85
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,583
and you're fine?

86
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,359
Why wouldn't I be?

87
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:54,947

âª âª

90
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:27,702
<i>You're not feeling a little...</i>

91
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,883
betrayed and angry?

92
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,359
Wilson bought a two-bedroom condo

93
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,601
specifically so that you
could move in with him.

94
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:37,340
It wasn't that long ago.

95
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,214
You don't feel a little...

96
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:41,891
jerked around?

97
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,467
He couldn't foresee Sam
coming back into his life.

98
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:47,178
That's a very rational
defense of your friend.

99
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:49,487
And, uh, I'm not buying it.

100
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:50,959
Based on what?

101
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,033
Based on the fact
that you were late,

102
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,309
and you didn't notice the
pictures in the outer office.

103
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:57,316
Those aren't symptoms.
They are to me.

104
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:58,687
And here's another one.

105
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:01,030
You took the case. Hmm?

106
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,572
No negotiating, no bargaining.

107
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:05,580
No clinic hours changed hands.

108
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,951
Were you looking for something

109
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,258
to distract you from the fact

110
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:10,365
that your best friend
just threw you out?

111
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:12,841
Case was interesting.
It's not organic.

112
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:14,314
It's not mysterious.

113
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,727
Most likely some psychologically
traumatic event occurred

114
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:21,474
that made the patient's brain
choose to forget everything.

115
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:22,712
Or not.

116
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:24,652
Here.

117
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:27,630
Loss of differentiation
between gray and white matter.

118
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,437
<i>That's subtle.</i>

119
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:31,277
But it's in the area
that controls memory.

120
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,084
Not likely it's a coincidence.

121
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,493
Bacterial infection?

122
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:37,668
Do I need to know this?

123
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:40,043
Fine. I'll give you the
cliff notes version--

124
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:41,951
chase--m.S. Taub--physical trauma.

125
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:43,724
I can tell you why
we ruled them out.

126
00:05:43,724 --> 00:05:44,567
Or not.

127
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:48,309
It's probably a toxin,

128
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:49,814
and we need to find it
before it kills her.

129
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:51,118
We should search her House.

130
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,691
Good luck with that.

131
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,372
Her heart rate monitor
has a serial number.

132
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,543
<i>The distributor can match
the number</i>

133
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:58,847
<i>to the store that sold it.</i>

134
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:00,320
She's a serious athlete.

135
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,826
She might have been there
often enough to be remembered.

136
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,431
Brilliant.

137
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:04,536
<i>Did he really say that?</i>

138
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:06,410
Subtextually.

139
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,417
Long shot.

140
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,258
Even if the store clerk
doesn't know who she is,

141
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:11,932
the store's probably
close to where she lives.

142
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:13,704
Just seeing those surroundings
might spark a memory.

143
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,477
You want us to take her there?

144
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:16,716
<i>No.</i>

145
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:18,523
I'll take her.

146
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:19,364
Really?

147
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,938
Uh, it's unusual for you to
spend time with a patient,

148
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:24,077
isn't it?

149
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:25,716
Patients are boring...

150
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:26,954
As people.

151
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,660
This one I'm sure was no exception,

152
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,270
but her situation was interesting.

153
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,047
Besides, I was still
avoiding Wilson.

154
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:36,256
And no better way to avoid
than leaving the hospital.

155
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:37,527
Maybe.

156
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,736
Or were you avoiding going home?

157
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:41,342
There's a reason they tell addicts

158
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:43,315
to stay away from old geography.

159
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:44,722
I wasn't avoiding going home.

160
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,963
I'd already gone home...

161
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:48,836
Before I came into work that day.

162
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:51,112
I went straight
there from Wilson's.

163
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:56,834
<i>Hey, take it easy! You're gonna kill me!</i>

164
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,271
<i>God, why don't people knock?</i>

165
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:00,113
House, it's you! Where you been?

166
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:02,019
Hold up a second.

167
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,592
<i>Alvie?</i>

168
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:06,604
Juan alvarez-- you let
him stay at your place?

169
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:09,313
Not exactly.

170
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:15,771
I was beginning to wonder if
you were ever gonna show up.

171
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,382
<i>Su casa, mi casa. Casa!</i>

172
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:20,823
Why are you here?

173
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:22,162
When I left Mayfield,

174
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,834
I went back to the
old neighborhood.

175
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:26,579
You know, you shouldn't leave
the bathroom window unlocked.

176
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,683
Yeah, thanks for the safety lesson.

177
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:28,988
Why are you here?

178
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:30,460
Like I said, when I went
back to the neighborhood,

179
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,167
I found out immigration
was looking for me.

180
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,542
So I decided to visit
my old buddy House!

181
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,884
And turn his apartment into
a giant prison jumpsuit.

182
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:38,155
Juan alvarez is no freeloader.

183
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:39,695
I do my part, earn my keep.

184
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,268
The first week I made your dinner,

185
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:42,840
but you never showed up.

186
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,445
<i>The second week i organized your stuff.</i>

187
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:46,755
My stuff?

188
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,093
But still, you never showed up.

189
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,900
<i>So this week, since I'm a real
good painter,</i>

190
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,707
<i>i decided to-- coffee table--</i>

191
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:54,551
where'd you put it?

192
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,358
In the bedroom?

193
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,566
The paint's not cheap, House.
It's a custom color.

194
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:01,109
It's a mix of titanium,
yellow, and ochre.

195
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:02,514
Ochre--I don't even
like that stuff.

196
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:04,153
It's like a fruit.
It's got hair on it.

197
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,626
But they say it's a vegetable--

198
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:10,243
you sold my table to pay for
paint that I don't want?

199
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:14,091
I had to sell some
other things too.

200
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,642
Get out.

201
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:20,950
No, papa, just give
the color a chance.

202
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,624
Look, I'm going to work now.

203
00:08:22,624 --> 00:08:24,229
And when I come back,

204
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,237
the walls will be a
less exciting color,

205
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:29,182
and you will be gone.

206
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:32,863
So Wilson threw you out,
and you threw alvie out--

207
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:34,903
just, uh, another week?

208
00:08:34,903 --> 00:08:36,877
<i>Unlike me, alvie didn't leave.</i>

209
00:08:36,877 --> 00:08:38,684
I took my motorcycle
to work that day.

210
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,758
When I went home to get my car,

211
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:43,769
he was painting the
ceiling magenta.

212
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,614
So I brought him with me
to protect the apartment.

213
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:48,254
Why?

214
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:50,362
To protect the apartment.

215
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:51,901
Whoa. Deja vu.

216
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:53,540
<i>Tossing him out</i>

217
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,079
or, uh, sending him to the movies

218
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,818
or, uh, locking him in the bathroom

219
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:59,496
would also minimize
alvie's destructive force.

220
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:02,205
But you chose his
company deliberately.

221
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,611
Why?

222
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,586
<i>Obviously because he's a Wilson
substitute.</i>

223
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,594
You can barely tell the
difference between them,

224
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,433
especially when Wilson
raps about the hood.

225
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,174
I'm not suggesting
alvie's a substitute,

226
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,114
but he would make a
great distraction.

227
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:14,620
From what?

228
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,192
<i>That's what I'm trying to find out.</i>

229
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:20,074
Go on.

230
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,832
Maybe the heart rate
monitor was a gift.

231
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,237
That's why no one recognized her.

232
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:30,245
Shut up, alvie.

233
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:31,851
Anything familiar...

234
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:34,862
Church, grocery store?

235
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:36,436
Sorry.

236
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:38,008
It's okay, Ms. x.

237
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,881
Maybe she's never been
to this town before,

238
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:42,191
bought the heart rate monitor
on the store's website.

239
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:44,264
You know that puerto ricans are U.
S. citizens, right?

240
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:45,603
Instead of working the case,

241
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,510
why don't you contemplate
the inanity of an American

242
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,915
with American immigration issues?

243
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:51,157
I had a birth certificate.
I lost it.

244
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,132
So get a new one.
I tried that, House.

245
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:54,938
But the town hall had burned
down when I was a kid,

246
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,177
destroyed the records.

247
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,649
There's only one copy?

248
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:00,527
They tried to make me fill
out a whole bunch of forms

249
00:10:00,527 --> 00:10:02,333
before they'd give it to me.

250
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,575
I decided it would be quicker
and easier to do it myself.

251
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:06,683
How'd that go? They
figured out it was forged.

252
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:07,921
And now, for some reason,

253
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,459
they don't believe anything I say.

254
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,669
They actually think I'm lying
about being puerto rican.

255
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:14,277
Told me I had to go to a
special hearing to prove it.

256
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:17,289
What if nothing
ever looks familiar?

257
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,408
Then someone will show up-
a spouse, a friend--

258
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:24,015
to tell you who you really are

259
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:25,621
and what you should be feeling.

260
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,093
They always do.

261
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,305
I don't know who that is...

262
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:32,112
But I miss him.

263
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:36,663
What did they say at the hearing?

264
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:38,403
<i>I didn't go.</i>

265
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:39,840
I lied once.

266
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,911
Your mother is puerto rican,

267
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:42,250
therefore, you are puerto rican.

268
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,622
All you got to do is prove
your mom's your mom,

269
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:45,195
find some documentation--

270
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:47,437
people like that don't
listen to people like me.

271
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:49,578
Doughnuts! Hey, House,
let's get doughnuts!

272
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:51,284
Alvie, the hearing-
everyone loves doughnuts--

273
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,724
glazed, crullers, elephant ears,

274
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:54,463
even doughnut holes.

275
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:55,935
Much better than the
sporting goods store.

276
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:57,240
I went Mrs.
x went there all the time.

277
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,946
We're not here--

278
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:01,656
<i>And then I realized...</i>

279
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:03,195
You make a good point.

280
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,238
Really? I was making that up.

281
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:08,081
Dozen glazed, dozen jelly-filled?

282
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:10,758
You want the usual, right?

283
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:13,133
Your old friend,
the fried carbohydrate.

284
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:15,141
She needed the
calorically dense food

285
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,713
to support the running habit.

286
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:18,320
<i>Do you know her name?</i>

287
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:21,966
Sandy...

288
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,338
<i>Or shelley.</i>

289
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:24,710
<i>I don't know.
The guy she's with</i>

290
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,914
called her that once.

291
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:27,588
I just work here.

292
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:29,026
Do you know where they live?

293
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:32,607
He left a business card
in our free doughnut jar.

294
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:34,313
It's up on the wall of winners.

295
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:43,549
Sidney.

296
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:49,437
God, I was so worried about you.

297
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:52,113
What happened?

298
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,821
The police said it was
too soon to do anything,

299
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:05,296
<i>so I started calling hospitals
on my own.</i>

300
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:07,504
<i>Princeton Plainsboro wasn't
even on my list.</i>

301
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:08,709
<i>You really think something
around here</i>

302
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,051
<i>could have made her sick?</i>

303
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,660
<i>Here, work, anywhere she could
have been exposed.</i>

304
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,070
Why wasn't Princeton
Plainsboro on your list?

305
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,511
Well, I mean,
it's a long way to run,

306
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:19,750
even for her.

307
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,096
What is it I do besides run?

308
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:27,780
You're a lawyer--

309
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,821
civil rights, class action suits.

310
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:32,264
It's a stressful job.

311
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:34,304
Running's the way you deal with it.

312
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:36,212
That doesn't sound like me.

313
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:37,617
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

314
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,223
what would sound like you?

315
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:41,700
Good point.

316
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,707
<i>So what were you thinking during all this?</i>

317
00:12:43,707 --> 00:12:47,421
<i>That it was a strange position to be in.</i>

318
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:49,528
<i>At that moment, she was
more comfortable with me</i>

319
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:50,968
<i>than with her husband.</i>

320
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:54,079
<i>And he was picking up on it.</i>

321
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,853
<i>What about you?</i>

322
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,827
What about me how?

323
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:00,403
Well, there was a sort of, um,

324
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:03,148
artificial intimacy between you?

325
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:04,685
<i>She'd been dependent on you.</i>

326
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,262
<i>Uh, did you find that attractive
on some level?</i>

327
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:09,571
Disturbing?

328
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:11,378
Those are my two choices?

329
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,687
<i>None of the above.</i>

330
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:16,933
She was just a patient.
She was interesting.

331
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:22,821
So we're really...

332
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:24,728
Married?

333
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:26,368
For four years.

334
00:13:26,368 --> 00:13:28,878
Ms. X, you lead a lemon fresh life.

335
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,952
<i>Found three different cleansers
under the sink.</i>

336
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:32,558
Cleaned out the
medicine cabinets too.

337
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:33,896
You know, she just won a settlement

338
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,870
for some families whose
housing development

339
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,078
<i>was built on an old methane field.</i>

340
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,554
<i>Toxic exposure to methane
could explain this.</i>

341
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,529
I surf?

342
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,402
You stopped before we met.

343
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:48,050
You've been too busy.

344
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,191
And we're married?

345
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:51,193
Yes.

346
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,106
<i>All right, it's nothing personal.</i>

347
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:56,280
Bet she didn't think
you were her type

348
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,753
<i>back when you first met either.</i>

349
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,092
We'll take her back
to the hospital,

350
00:13:59,092 --> 00:14:01,433
test her blood and urine
and start treatment.

351
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,186
Oh!

352
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,482
I'm all right.

353
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:07,824
What happened? I don't know.

354
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:09,731
My foot suddenly went numb.

355
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:11,671
Her pants are wet.

356
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:15,018
Urinary incontinence.

357
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:18,364
She's having complex
partial seizures.

358
00:14:18,364 --> 00:14:20,271
This isn't methane.

359
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:22,981
You can leave the bucket.
We need to get her to--

360
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,888
<i>Seizures?</i>

361
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:27,331
This is the second diagnosis
you've come up with

362
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,271
that has a personal
resonance for you.

363
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:32,485
I'm choosing my diagnoses
based on personal issues?

364
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:34,759
You think she fell down the
stairs and peed her pants

365
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,666
'cause Wilson dumped her too?

366
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,971
You're choosing to tell
me about this case,

367
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:39,511
so let's look at it.

368
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,150
First you were fixated on a
harmful toxin from her past,

369
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,391
<i>possibly because you're worried
about a harmful toxin</i>

370
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,567
<i>from your own past.
Chase had the toxin idea.</i>

371
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,971
Maybe he's obsessed with my past.

372
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,411
And now you're talking
about a seizure disorder?

373
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:50,251
Which is also not a toxin.

374
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:51,690
But which is most likely caused

375
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,397
by an old injury to the brain.

376
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:57,344
W-why do you see your
past as such a threat?

377
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:58,983
Not only am I unthreatened by it,

378
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,724
I was trying to get it back.

379
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:02,698
There's a ding mark.

380
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,772
<i>It's a piece of junk.</i>

381
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:07,047
It was dinged when it came in.

382
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:09,323
Sure, the--the cup marks and
the scuffs and the paint

383
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,895
and those three chips.

384
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:12,267
<i>This fourth one is new.</i>

385
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,341
I run a pawn shop,
not a storage company.

386
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:15,814
Do you want it or not?

387
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,624
That should be it.

388
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:20,933
You said you pawned five books.

389
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,406
There's only four.

390
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:24,580
That's all there is.

391
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,758
<i>Where's approach to the acute abdomen?</i>

392
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,138
Sold it.

393
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:31,890
To?

394
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:34,317
I can't tell you.

395
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:35,989
It's a law, and it should be.

396
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:39,370
Crazy bastards like you try
to hunt down their stuff.

397
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,389
How much for the pile?

398
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:48,236
$500.

399
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:49,909
You said it was junk.

400
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:51,114
No, no.

401
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:52,887
It's your junk. You want it.

402
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:56,435
$500-- take it or leave it.

403
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:00,289
âª âª

404
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,739
why is it so important that
you get your stuff back?

405
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:09,182
Unlike the rest of humanity...

406
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:11,625
Who's okay when their
belongings are taken.

407
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,234
Everyone wants their stuff.
That's why it's their stuff.

408
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,175
Everyone doesn't pay five
times what it's worth.

409
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,648
I like my stuff.

410
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:19,219
I hate it when Wilson moves it--

411
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:20,959
oh...

412
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,503
This is not about Wilson!

413
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,217
Say it.

414
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,021
I wasn't gonna say anything.

415
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:55,236
31, 31! Hike!

416
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:00,404
First down!

417
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:01,508
One more, you get a touchdown.

418
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:02,813
Whoo!

419
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,067
Hike!

420
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:08,367
Huh!

421
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,145
House,

422
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:13,152
<i>you can't run for the touchdown.</i>

423
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,711
And...Hike!

424
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:21,216
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Wait.</i>

425
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:22,688
<i>You seriously thought you
were gonna tell me</i>

426
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:25,131
that Wilson showed up but
not tell me what he said?

427
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:26,603
Because I thought
you were a smart guy

428
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:28,544
who didn't need the obvious
spelled out to him.

429
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:30,517
<i>Wilson noticed</i>

430
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,089
that I didn't come
to my office all day.

431
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,299
He came to find me,
wanted to make sure I'm okay--

432
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,239
boring, boring, boring.

433
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,811
Um, but you thought
it was important

434
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:39,251
to tell me about nerf football?

435
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:42,463
<i>Sorry. Your story.</i>

436
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:44,302
Continue.

437
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:48,586
House, House, stop! Stop,
stop, stop.

438
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,259
You okay?

439
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:51,513
Yeah.

440
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,851
It was my mother's.
She died when I was four.

441
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,858
It's all I have left.

442
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:00,665
That's very sad, alvie.

443
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:02,873
Listen, I set up an
immigration hearing.

444
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,478
No, House,

445
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:05,850
I'm gonna end up in jail or worse--

446
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,629
<i>the Dominican or someplace.
Que se yo. Que no.</i>

447
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,936
<i>Um, interesting.</i>

448
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:12,509
You present yourself as,
uh, not giving a damn

449
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,383
about other people's emotions,

450
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:17,260
<i>but your actions indicate otherwise.</i>

451
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,268
You dismiss alvie's
story about his mother,

452
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,978
but you cared enough
to schedule a hearing.

453
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:24,488
I cared for eight seconds.

454
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:26,863
Then I got distracted.

455
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:32,451
Yeah.

456
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:34,391
<i>We've kept the patient up for 12 hours now.</i>

457
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:36,198
<i>No hint of seizure-like activity.</i>

458
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,670
<i>We should shut this down.</i>

459
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,445
Try a strobe light,
add more stress.

460
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,385
<i>I think there's plenty
of stress in here.</i>

461
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:43,560
Don't we ever do anything but work?

462
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,370
You run. That's just more work.

463
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,847
What about fun?

464
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:50,486
God, how can we be this boring?

465
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:52,560
Apparently, without her memory,

466
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,667
the patient's
personality has returned

467
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:58,115
to what you might call
its natural state.

468
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:01,829
<i>Seems she had a wake-up call while
she was at college.</i>

469
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:03,903
Her brother died in a car accident.

470
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:06,212
She decided to make her
life mean something.

471
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,119
Went to law school.

472
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:12,134
Now that's all gone.

473
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,343
The thing that caused
the change is gone...

474
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:16,651
So the change itself is gone.

475
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:18,258
Yeah.

476
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,232
I knew the psychological
aspects of this case

477
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:22,005
would interest you.

478
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:24,247
Bet you got a theory already.
What is it?

479
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,287
It's not relevant.

480
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,329
What is it?

481
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:33,014
Why do you care about my theory?

482
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:35,087
I think he just...

483
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:36,827
<i>Bores her.</i>

484
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,935
<i>She's at an earlier stage
of development.</i>

485
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:40,909
<i>She's looking at her grown-up future,</i>

486
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,348
<i>and it puts her to sleep.</i>

487
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,957
If he just bored her,

488
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:47,133
she'd hide it to be polite.

489
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,040
Their problem is synchronicity.

490
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,984
Just like you and me, House,
they're not on the same page.

491
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,156
He talks to her

492
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:54,963
like someone he
shares history with.

493
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,170
But from her point of view,
he's a stranger

494
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,044
<i>forcing intimacy on her.</i>

495
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:01,052
<i>Of course she doesn't like him.
He's not helping.</i>

496
00:20:01,052 --> 00:20:05,335
<i>He can feel he's losing his wife,</i>

497
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:07,208
and it makes him come on stronger.

498
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,629
He almost did lose his wife.

499
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:41,337
The breathing problem

500
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:42,509
was caused by fluid
overload in the lungs.

501
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,248
Diabetes insipidus.

502
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:46,859
And the d.I. Came from
damage to the hypothalamus.

503
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,933
Hypothalamus here, hence the d.
I. And incontinence.

504
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,940
They mingle here.
There's the global amnesia.

505
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,680
And the motor cortex-
that's the foot paralysis.

506
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,621
What do they all have in common?

507
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,393
<i>Okay, now you're just doing this
to mess with me.</i>

508
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:58,368
What possible relevance

509
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:00,041
does this differential
have to your problems?

510
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:04,022
It ends with a diagnosis
of spongiform encephalitis.

511
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:06,633
I convinced the team to cut out
part of this woman's brain.

512
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,971
That's not interesting to you?

513
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:09,042
No.

514
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,350
Not even if it's the amygdala?

515
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,692
She'll lose all her
long-term memory.

516
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:15,198
Well, this is where you tell me

517
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:16,971
that being cavalier
with someone else's past

518
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:19,213
has nothing to do with
avoiding your own past.

519
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:20,719
The case is irrelevant.

520
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:23,798
You just found it,
uh... Interesting.

521
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:26,709
Aren't therapists
supposed to be nurturing?

522
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,582
Nowhere...

523
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:31,560
Is that in the manual.

524
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,936
Look, you--you've been
in therapy for a year.

525
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:35,809
You know when I ask you
to talk about anything,

526
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:37,583
I mean anything that affects you--

527
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,356
what upset you, what made you mad

528
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:41,698
or relieved or joyful.

529
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:45,044
You want me to believe that
this case means nothing?

530
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,160
Then, um...

531
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,208
Why should I listen to it?

532
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:15,793
Are you charging me for this time?

533
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,567
Yes.

534
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:22,653
This is ridiculous.

535
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:24,929
What's that?

536
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,873
<i>On the back of your arm?</i>

537
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,590
It's just a bruise. And I fell.

538
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,233
You remember falling?

539
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,571
No.

540
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,943
I was drunk...

541
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:39,818
Hence the balance issues.

542
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,858
Well, it looks like you fell

543
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:44,000
on the tip of someone's boot.

544
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:53,301
I said something that
someone objected to.

545
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:55,176
Well, if you don't remember,
then how can you--

546
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:56,614
<i>it's usually the way it is</i>

547
00:22:56,614 --> 00:22:58,487
when someone hits me.

548
00:22:58,487 --> 00:23:00,797
People who kick when
you're down are jerks,

549
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,603
but they're generally
not irrational jerks.

550
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:04,711
Yogot drunk enough to
get into a bar fight

551
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:06,217
and not remember,

552
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:10,098
and you've been insisting
that everything's fine?

553
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,475
W-why--why go out
and get blind drunk?

554
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,083
<i>Were you looking for a fight?</i>

555
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,158
I don't know.

556
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:24,285
What have you screwed up?

557
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:25,891
What?

558
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:27,632
<i>You say that when you've been
hit in the past,</i>

559
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:30,375
it's because you provoked it
with something that you said,

560
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,215
which means you're well
aware of the risks.

561
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:33,955
So on some level,

562
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:37,970
<i>you were in that bar looking
for someone to hurt you.</i>

563
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,111
<i>Logically, people punish
themselves</i>

564
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:43,089
for something they did or
something they didn't do.

565
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:47,439
So what...

566
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,780
Did you screw up?

567
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,514
I don't know.

568
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:11,864
Okay, there may be a problem.

569
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,862
All right...

570
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:21,679
Let's talk about Wilson.

571
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:25,091
I told him your book
was contaminated

572
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:26,965
with Anthrax spores.

573
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,838
Then I gave him $300.

574
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:30,880
The address of the buyer.

575
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,096
Maybe I was hasty in
asking you to move out.

576
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:37,872
Why don't you stay with me
and Sam for a little while?

577
00:24:37,872 --> 00:24:39,612
There's no need to hurry things.

578
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,222
What prompted this?

579
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:44,598
Look, the whole idea

580
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:47,542
was that after Mayfield,
you wouldn't be on your own.

581
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,785
I can touch base with
you a lot more easily

582
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:50,989
if you're staying with me than--

583
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,561
God's sake, Wilson.

584
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:54,535
<i>You really span the chasm</i>

585
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,040
from wishy to washy.

586
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,384
If you're gonna be an ass,
be an ass.

587
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:00,390
Stick with it.

588
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,063
<i>Why were you being so hard on the guy,</i>

589
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:03,435
when he was being conciliatory?

590
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,406
<i>Come on.</i>

591
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:07,585
Cuddy played on his guilt.

592
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:10,596
She put him up to this.
How do you know that?

593
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,436
How do you know this wasn't
entirely his own idea?

594
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:13,741
<i>Two reasons--</i>

595
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:16,151
first, he wants to create
the perfect environment

596
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:17,790
to be with Sam.

597
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,634
<i>He's been thinking about asking me
to leave for a while.</i>

598
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:22,641
Finally he does it and
immediately turns around

599
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:24,415
and changes his mind--no.

600
00:25:24,415 --> 00:25:25,486
He talked to somebody.

601
00:25:25,486 --> 00:25:27,526
Maybe it was Sam.

602
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:31,273
<i>Yeah, that's a possibility.</i>

603
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:33,816
I want this to be the
last serious relationship

604
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:35,390
I ever have.

605
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,530
I want this to be the one.

606
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,672
Me too.

607
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,553
Where's House?

608
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:45,896
It's not as meaningful without him.

609
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:47,769
Okay, um...

610
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:49,242
Not Sam.

611
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:51,516
<i>Uh, that still doesn't answer
why Cuddy.</i>

612
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,893
Because they've been
talking about me.

613
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:56,470
<i>She called me to check on the patient,</i>

614
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,309
which she never does
without a reason.

615
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:00,550
I asked why, and she said...

616
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,893
She's a barracuda attorney, House.

617
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:05,136
These are the kind of patients
we like to keep happy.

618
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:06,641
Right now the patient's lucky

619
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:08,950
if she can spell jurisprudence.

620
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,827
<i>Yeah, but when she gets that memory back,</i>

621
00:26:11,827 --> 00:26:13,467
<i>which we are trying to make happen,</i>

622
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:15,474
<i>she'll be able to spell lawsuit.</i>

623
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:17,983
I'm just touching base.

624
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:20,928
Touching base.

625
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:23,538
Wilson used exactly
the same phrase.

626
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:26,951
Colluding about me is
her favorite pastime.

627
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:29,092
Okay, you think they talked.

628
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:34,847
How do you think that
conversation went?

629
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:41,405
I'm worried about House.

630
00:26:41,405 --> 00:26:43,547
Me too.

631
00:26:43,547 --> 00:26:45,553
Couldn't you have waited?

632
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:48,231
It's way too early for
him to be on his own,

633
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,971
back in the old apartment.

634
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,375
What makes you think
he can handle it?

635
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,618
I offered to find him a new place.

636
00:26:53,618 --> 00:26:55,258
<i>You have to let him back into your condo.</i>

637
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:57,566
<i>Sam and I just got him out of the condo.</i>

638
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,440
<i>You know what House is like.
He's self-destructive.</i>

639
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,778
Without constant supervision,

640
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:02,886
he's gonna slide back into drugs.

641
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:05,496
If you're not watching him,
I've got to.

642
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:06,750
Yeah.

643
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,548
So they don't trust you.

644
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:12,923
They assume you'll fail.

645
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:16,170
Are these their fears or yours?

646
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:22,527
Let's turn on the lights, Hmm?

647
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:25,069
In your brain.

648
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:28,550
Maybe they did talk
about you, but...

649
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,066
How do you know it
didn't happen like this?

650
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,873
I'm worried about House. Why?

651
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:36,513
It's the first time
he'll be on his own

652
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:38,286
since Mayfield.

653
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:39,758
<i>Now you're being overprotective.</i>

654
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,298
<i>House doesn't need to be wrapped
in cotton wool.</i>

655
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:42,569
But you know that,

656
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,409
or you wouldn't have
asked him to move out.

657
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,584
Okay. I guess this
is really about me.

658
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:49,663
It's just... I feel like a jerk.

659
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:53,478
Sure, Sam and I are gonna want
to be on our own eventually,

660
00:27:53,478 --> 00:27:55,484
<i>but I kind of sprang this on him.</i>

661
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:57,157
<i>The right way would have been</i>

662
00:27:57,157 --> 00:27:59,032
<i>to just tell him to take as
long as he needed,</i>

663
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:00,871
<i>that there's no hurry.</i>

664
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:02,411
<i>So it's not what you did,</i>

665
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:04,217
but how you did it.

666
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:06,927
That matters in a friendship.

667
00:28:06,927 --> 00:28:08,334
I need to fix this.

668
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:12,114
Why don't you talk to him
about moving back in?

669
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:13,921
Just touch base.

670
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:17,868
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

671
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:20,311
Wait a minute. Taub's not here.

672
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:22,419
Yeah, he is.

673
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:23,891
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

674
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:25,598
What's Taub doing in
my imaginary version

675
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,304
of a scene with Wilson and Cuddy?

676
00:28:27,304 --> 00:28:28,542
Your version needed to be ended,

677
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:29,882
'cause it's crap.

678
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,587
It's all sweetness and light and...

679
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,565
Faith that I'm gonna
choose the right path.

680
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:36,941
Yeah, that sounds like Wilson.

681
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,421
<i>I have as much evidence
for mine</i>

682
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:42,495
as you do for yours.

683
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:44,938
I know Wilson's your friend.

684
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:47,949
So he could be wondering
if he did right by you.

685
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:49,789
And I know he wouldn't
have asked you to move out

686
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,462
in the first place
unless he was convinced

687
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:53,001
you could handle life on your own.

688
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:56,046
And I know that he and Cuddy
have gone behind my back before

689
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:58,991
to strategize about
the House problem.

690
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:01,400
So there's truth in both versions.

691
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,374
But you choose to
focus on the parts

692
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,147
that make you uncomfortable.

693
00:29:05,147 --> 00:29:06,400
So...

694
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,921
Why are you and Wilson...

695
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,895
Friends?

696
00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:21,978
Do you think this friendship

697
00:29:21,978 --> 00:29:24,219
is the best you can do?

698
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:27,097
Wilson is not a consolation prize.

699
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:29,338
There... You're defending him.

700
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:30,477
And a minute ago,

701
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,317
he was skulking around
in the background

702
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:35,696
like some sort of
manipulative iago.

703
00:29:35,696 --> 00:29:37,837
He's my friend.

704
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:40,079
So what do you value in him?

705
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,641
I can say whatever I want to him,

706
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:49,113
and he'll never leave.

707
00:29:49,113 --> 00:29:51,421
He's sort of leaving.

708
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:55,537
At least, he won't
be around as much...

709
00:29:55,537 --> 00:29:58,750
Because he's putting Sam first.

710
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,757
For now.

711
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,196
After the divorce,

712
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:04,203
he'll probably ask
me to move in again.

713
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:07,717
I take the long view.

714
00:30:07,717 --> 00:30:10,125
You say that to Wilson?
Are you kidding?

715
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:13,505
That's the kind of remark
that leads people to hate you.

716
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:19,194
Uh, maybe you've been
right from the beginning.

717
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:22,773
Maybe this isn't about Wilson.

718
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:25,717
You say that now that I
finally agree with you?

719
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:28,328
Do you just argue the
opposite of whatever I say?

720
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,770
I don't mean the Wilson thing
doesn't, uh, bother you,

721
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,844
uh, but it sounds like he's
the closest you can come

722
00:30:32,844 --> 00:30:34,351
to a safe relationship.

723
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:37,228
You'd have to do something
major to screw it up.

724
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:40,875
Um, what--what else have you
been involved in this week?

725
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:45,458
What would you want to
punish yourself for?

726
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:48,270
I told you, I don't know.

727
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:53,556
Okay, um, let's approach
it from a different angle.

728
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:57,203
Have you gotten any other
people angry at you

729
00:30:57,203 --> 00:31:00,382
over anything?

730
00:31:00,382 --> 00:31:02,121
Well, yeah.

731
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,530
That's why I called
it an ordinary week.

732
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,509
Okay. Tell me about it.

733
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:14,384
<i>You'd be losing a part of your brain.</i>

734
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:15,772
It is my brain.

735
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:18,081
Why is it not my right to consent?

736
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:19,318
<i>I'm sorry, but...</i>

737
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:21,326
I'll take this to
court if necessary.

738
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:22,665
All right, Sidney's in no position

739
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:24,370
to make decisions about
herself right now.

740
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,909
She doesn't even know who she is.

741
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:27,683
I read your consent form,
and I understood it.

742
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:30,025
<i>I want the surgery.
Why wouldn't she?</i>

743
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:31,431
Of course she's willing to risk

744
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,204
losing her memories permanently.

745
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:35,647
She has no idea how important
those memories are.

746
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:37,855
Does she even know what risk is?

747
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,230
She's never lost anything.

748
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,438
Without the surgery,
she'll lose everything.

749
00:31:42,438 --> 00:31:43,912
The prion infection

750
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:46,220
will continue to advance and
destroy her whole brain.

751
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,097
Well, there has to be another way.

752
00:31:49,097 --> 00:31:49,940
Please.

753
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,686
I'm speaking for my wife,

754
00:31:54,686 --> 00:31:56,694
the wife I lived
with for four years

755
00:31:56,694 --> 00:31:59,403
<i>who isn't here and can't
defend herself.</i>

756
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:02,381
Dr. House, are you listening?

757
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,824
Well, you can stop arguing,

758
00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:06,831
'cause it doesn't matter anymore.

759
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:09,808
Look at the variability
in the heart rate.

760
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:11,750
The s.E. Has spread
into the brain stem.

761
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,021
W-wherever it is,

762
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:16,300
you--you can still cut it out.

763
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,077
No. We can't cut the brain stem.

764
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:21,453
This thing's moving too quickly.

765
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:23,795
Surgery's no longer an option,

766
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:25,501
which I guess means you've won.

767
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:26,907
Congratulations.

768
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:30,487
Put in a pacer and start
her on chemo and radiation.

769
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:32,829
It won't cure her,
but it'll buy a couple weeks

770
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:37,246
so she can find out who
she is before she dies.

771
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,755
<i>That was pretty rough.</i>

772
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:42,064
<i>Do you always break the news to
your patients that way?</i>

773
00:32:42,064 --> 00:32:44,808
<i>Or were you short-handing it for me?</i>

774
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:46,414
Husband was being an idiot.

775
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:49,090
Well, he was asking for it.

776
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:53,072
But, um, to punish him you
have to punish the wife too.

777
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:55,046
Why--why did he make
you so angry, Hmm?

778
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:57,990
Because he didn't want
to cooperate with you?

779
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,741
He'd rather risk his wife's
life than their marriage.

780
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:04,348
People's brains stop working

781
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:06,723
when they think they're gonna
lose someone they love.

782
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:09,768
Your leg hurt?

783
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:14,922
It's all right.

784
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:16,175
Okay.

785
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:19,204
Anyone else you pissed off?

786
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:29,242
50 bucks for the book.

787
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:30,982
Forget it.

788
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:33,926
You paid $25. That's 100% return.

789
00:33:33,926 --> 00:33:35,230
That's what I paid.

790
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,737
But it's a rare surgical text,

791
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:39,347
nearly 100 years old-
plate's in mint condition.

792
00:33:39,347 --> 00:33:42,124
That book's worth several
thousand dollars.

793
00:33:42,124 --> 00:33:44,499
$2,000-- I'll write you a check.

794
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:45,838
Nice try.

795
00:33:45,838 --> 00:33:47,411
Face it-- I had the wit

796
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:50,121
to recognize something
valuable when I saw it.

797
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:53,701
In the great darwinian race,
I get my just reward.

798
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:56,176
You become roadkill.

799
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,895
Yo, House, you want to
stop by the library?

800
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:12,705
'Cause I got a book to return.
Ta-ka-plow!

801
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,947
âª Old Professor
tried to hoard/hog âª

802
00:34:14,947 --> 00:34:17,491
âª you can't stop alvie
with no guard-ass dog âª

803
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:18,862
anyone see you?

804
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:20,668
Yeah, prof saw me walking
down the driveway.

805
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:22,510
He said the roses
need more fertilizer.

806
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,540
I didn't know there was
a section of the brain

807
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,481
just for hope.

808
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:34,052
It's very, very tiny.

809
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:36,094
We used fluoroscopy to
guide pacemaker placement

810
00:34:36,094 --> 00:34:37,299
in the patient's heart.

811
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:39,038
Hello.

812
00:34:39,038 --> 00:34:40,477
Hello.

813
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:42,686
Rapidly progressive
dilated cardiomyopathy.

814
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:44,526
This isn't s.E.,

815
00:34:44,526 --> 00:34:46,232
and whatever it is,
it's not just in her brain.

816
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:47,671
It's attacking her whole body.

817
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,410
You work for House?
I guess we're teammates.

818
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,251
<i>Isn't that cool?</i>

819
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:51,974
Hello.

820
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:55,266
Juan alvarez?

821
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,007
What the hell?

822
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:59,449
<i>We're taking you into custody-
deportation order.</i>

823
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:00,686
I'm a citizen.

824
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:02,226
You're disrespecting Puerto Rico.

825
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,970
If you're a citizen,
why'd you miss your hearing?

826
00:35:07,414 --> 00:35:09,420
You called them?

827
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:17,015
What's going on?

828
00:35:25,997 --> 00:35:27,468
We're trying to
stabilize her heart.

829
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:29,073
She's still tachy and hypotensive.

830
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:30,245
<i>Brain, heart,</i>

831
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:32,688
and rapidly progressing.

832
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:35,264
<i>Endocarditis--slow-moving
infection in her heart</i>

833
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:36,770
<i>throws clots to her brain.</i>

834
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,483
I'm not talking to you.

835
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:42,458
How could you turn me in?

836
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,665
<i>Her extreme exercise suppresses
her immune system,</i>

837
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:47,008
allows the infection to smolder.

838
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:50,856
<i>Or allows an old infection
to reactivate it--t.B.</i>

839
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:52,696
Start her on a multidrug regimen.

840
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:54,369
I don't like you, House.

841
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,276
I hate you.

842
00:35:56,276 --> 00:35:58,551
<i>Even I.V. Antibiotics will
take time to work.</i>

843
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:01,830
A general reminder--the use
of cell phones is prohibited.

844
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,236
Give her the first dose

845
00:36:03,236 --> 00:36:05,444
directly into the lungs in the O.R.

846
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:07,217
<i>Before the less gentle arrest
for contempt.</i>

847
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:09,192
Put her in an isolation
room with U.V. light.

848
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:12,304
And get yourselves tested.
You've all been exposed.

849
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:18,159
Docket number 4378.

850
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:24,483
<i>You are?</i>

851
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:27,193
I am Mr. alvarez's doctor.

852
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:35,993
Your honor, DNA evidence

853
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:39,874
proving the matriarchal
lineage of Juan alvarez.

854
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:44,391
My mother's DNA was
still on that cross?

855
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:46,968
It could be.

856
00:36:46,968 --> 00:36:49,411
You faked it?

857
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:55,600
It wasn't just me.
You lied to them too!

858
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,745
I'm better at it than you are.

859
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:00,953
I'm gonna repaint your
whole apartment now,

860
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:03,195
<i>make the drapes match the carpet now!</i>

861
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:07,144
Lungs sound wet.

862
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:08,280
<i>O-2 sats are dropping.</i>

863
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,552
<i>May need to tube her.</i>

864
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:11,627
Grab some I.V. Furosemide.

865
00:37:15,242 --> 00:37:17,751
Wait, wait. She's crashing.

866
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:20,594
<i>We need to get her on
a vent.</i>

867
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:32,339
There's something on her ankle.

868
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:35,022
<i>Tattoo.</i>

869
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,997
"Eddie would go.
" It's a surfing phrase.

870
00:37:38,997 --> 00:37:40,937
Must be from her earlier life.

871
00:37:40,937 --> 00:37:43,079
She tried to get it removed,

872
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,723
but they only took off
the top layers of skin.

873
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:47,696
The ink is still in
the deeper layers.

874
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:49,638
Set off an allergic reaction.

875
00:37:49,638 --> 00:37:51,210
<i>She was fine until she started</i>

876
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,749
<i>the long-distance running.</i>

877
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:55,158
The ultra-marathoning
modified her immune system,

878
00:37:55,158 --> 00:37:57,133
set off the allergic reaction.

879
00:37:57,133 --> 00:38:00,043
We did a full thickness skin graft,

880
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:02,787
and she'll be okay.

881
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:05,932
So you were right... In the end.

882
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:09,244
<i>It was her past.</i>

883
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:11,386
<i>Did she get her memory back?</i>

884
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:12,348
<i>Not yet.</i>

885
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:15,803
<i>Will she?</i>

886
00:38:15,803 --> 00:38:18,011
No way to know.

887
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:19,985
<i>I think roses are my favorite.</i>

888
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:23,832
But I guess I told you
that at some point.

889
00:38:23,832 --> 00:38:25,807
I don't remember.

890
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:32,265
<i>He's treating her as though they just met.</i>

891
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:33,537
<i>He's courting her.</i>

892
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:36,748
Whose idea was that?

893
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,789
He was doing the opposite
of everything he should.

894
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:40,395
Suddenly he's changed.

895
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:42,470
<i>Taub thought it might-
that was your idea.</i>

896
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,344
And you asked me

897
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:46,651
what I thought was
going on between them.

898
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:49,129
It's their relationship
that's on your mind.

899
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:51,437
That's why you've been
thinking about this case--

900
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:53,244
relationships.

901
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:55,285
Lost one with Wilson,
gained one with alvie.

902
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:59,032
<i>Not exactly.</i>

903
00:38:59,032 --> 00:38:59,754
Alvie?

904
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,450
<i>You gonna tell me what the note said?</i>

905
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:27,874
Alvie was very grateful

906
00:39:27,874 --> 00:39:30,049
that I'd gotten him out of trouble.

907
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:32,225
It allowed him to go stay
with his cousin in Phoenix

908
00:39:32,225 --> 00:39:33,629
without worrying about immigration

909
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:36,306
looking for him there.

910
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:38,983
You didn't think he was
gonna stay forever.

911
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:39,735
<i>No.</i>

912
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,738
What happened next?

913
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:49,790
âª âª

914
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,832
<i>Nothing happened next.</i>

915
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:52,674
âª âª

916
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:21,008
That's all I got.

917
00:40:25,326 --> 00:40:28,001
Relationships.

918
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:29,540
Bergman.

919
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,013
What do you want me to say?

920
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,250
<i>I don't know.</i>

921
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,823
<i>You're the one who said the thing-
-</i>

922
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:36,400
something about relationships

923
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,909
made you go out and
provoke a fight.

924
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:43,225
Wilson and Sam have a relationship.

925
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:44,698
You're not thrilled about it.

926
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:46,806
They're happy.

927
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:49,716
Why should I screw that up?

928
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:51,824
Everyone's happy.

929
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:55,170
Everyone's moving in together--

930
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,111
Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and Lucas.

931
00:40:57,111 --> 00:40:58,415
Even alvie's--

932
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,858
Cuddy and Lucas are
moving in together?

933
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:03,100
You didn't mention that.

934
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,276
They talked about moving
in together before.

935
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:07,550
It's not big news.

936
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,804
Cuddy...

937
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:19,214
Cuddy.

938
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:26,188
<i>Approach to the acute abdomen...</i>

939
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:36,426
Written by Ernest t. Cuddy, m.D.

940
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:38,902
<i>Any relation to your Cuddy?</i>

941
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:42,850
Her great-grandfather.

942
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,326
I've had it for years...

943
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:48,438
Always meant to give it to
her for a special occasion.

944
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:51,148
Like her... Housewarming?

945
00:41:51,148 --> 00:41:53,290
It's just a gift.

946
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,129
<i>A woman you care about</i>

947
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:56,802
is taking one step
further away from you

948
00:41:56,802 --> 00:41:58,944
and closer to someone else?

949
00:41:58,944 --> 00:42:00,584
I-I think I can safely say

950
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:03,328
<i>yes, it's significant if
you don't mention it.</i>

951
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:05,636
You were willing to punish
the husband of your patient

952
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:09,251
because you identified with him.

953
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:12,428
He was also losing
someone he loved.

954
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:13,901
I'm not gonna go out
and get hammered

955
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,407
because a woman I'm not even with

956
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,478
is moving in with someone.

957
00:42:16,478 --> 00:42:18,752
That'd be pathetic.

958
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:23,972
To hell with this.

959
00:42:25,513 --> 00:42:27,084
When I first came to you,

960
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:30,062
I told you that I
wanted to be happy,

961
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:33,174
and I followed your advice.

962
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:35,482
And instead, I'm just miserable.

963
00:42:35,482 --> 00:42:37,857
How is this working for me?

964
00:42:37,857 --> 00:42:40,601
It takes time.

965
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:43,177
For a year, I've done
everything you've asked,

966
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:46,089
and everybody else is happy.

967
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:49,970
I run on my treadmill.
You just sit there and watch.

968
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,246
You're a faith healer.

969
00:42:52,246 --> 00:42:55,558
You take advantage of
people who want to believe.

970
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,082
But there's nothing
in your bag of tricks.

971
00:43:03,556 --> 00:43:04,519
House...

972
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,911
Whatever the answer is,
you don't have it.

9999
