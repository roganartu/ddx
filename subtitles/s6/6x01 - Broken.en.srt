1
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:33,137
Help!

2
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:36,991
Help me!

3
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:41,201
Dry heaves are gone, so am I.

4
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:43,003
I'll check with the doctor.

5
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:46,443
I'm here voluntarily,
just got to check with me.

6
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:49,500
I'm sorry.
Dr. Nolan left specific instructions.

7
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:56,130
She's not sick. She's scared.
So tell her to tell...

8
00:02:58,342 --> 00:02:59,727
And he's black.

9
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:04,349
I thought you'd be a little more
sensitive on the slavery issue.

10
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:18,598
- Can't keep me.
- You look a lot better.

11
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:20,657
I am a lot better... No painkillers,

12
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,452
no hallucinations.
Leg hurts, but it's manageable.

13
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,096
Great job.

14
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:28,206
Gonna miss you. Want to start
missing you as soon as possible.

15
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:31,376
Legally, you're free to go
whenever you want. I suggest you stay.

16
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:33,445
I'll take it under advisement.

17
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,505
If the hallucinations
were from your vicodin,

18
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,047
why didn't you just check yourself
into a rehab facility?

19
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:40,474
I was deluded into thinking
I might be crazy.

20
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:42,846
But you had been abusing vicodin
for years.

21
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,213
Never had delusions,
never had trouble sleeping,

22
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,613
never had any problems,
other than narcissism

23
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:50,523
and antisocial behavior,
until two colleagues died.

24
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:52,456
Your father died.

25
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:55,709
Your issues run deeper than vicodin.

26
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,820
That's not gonna cheer me up, is it?

27
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,031
You need to be transferred
to our long-term ward,

28
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:03,169
started on medication,
talk therapy...

29
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:04,296
Yeah, I get it.

30
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,985
Just one thing
I'm getting hung up on.

31
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,890
I can leave whenever I want.

32
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,749
How about I start with that?

33
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:14,174
You can't go back
to practicing medicine.

34
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,325
I don't want to practice medicine.

35
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,986
I want to be an astronaut.

36
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:24,952
Well, if you want
your state astronaut's license,

37
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:27,264
you're gonna need my recommendation.

38
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,325
Is that a popular, new treatment...

39
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,780
Blackmail?

40
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,075
You need to get better.

41
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,429
Welcome to ward six.

42
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:56,746
So brass tacks...
What do I have to do,

43
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:58,889
and how long do I have to be here?

44
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:01,621
Depends on you.
Process is pretty basic.

45
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,747
If you follow the schedule,
agree to take meds,

46
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,988
participate in group
and individual therapy,

47
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:08,974
- we can work on goals.
- I set a goal.

48
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:11,875
- Excellent. What is it?
- My goal is to get your boss

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,237
to write the letter
that I want him to write.

50
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:15,527
Now let's talk process.

51
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:18,320
I can smile through
gritted teeth and play nice,

52
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,813
but there are serious risks of violence
involved in that choice,

53
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:23,271
so I'm going with turning
this ward upside down,

54
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:26,559
making you and your boss' job and life
so unmanageable

55
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:29,232
that he'll write whatever
he has to write to get rid of me.

56
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:30,995
He's all set.

57
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,379
Thanks.

58
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:45,653
I've never been
in the end unit before.

59
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,882
Yo, I don't need an escort.
Get off me.

60
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,766
Who are you?
You believe these guys?

61
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,681
Lecturing me on manic depression,
like I couldn't write a book or two.

62
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:57,235
I stop taking my meds,
because I want to stop taking my meds,

63
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,971
because nothing is wrong with me.

64
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:01,138
No reason to keep
dragging me back here.

65
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:03,138
When I'm on them,
everything slows down.

66
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,707
That's when the problem is.

67
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,282
Nice to see you. My roommate last time
couldn't stand me.

68
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:10,535
- Really?
- Juan Alvarez. J.A.'s my stage name.

69
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:12,807
But Alvie's what everybody
around here calls me,

70
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:15,126
like the Woody Allen character
in <i>Annie Hall</i>,

71
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,417
but the Puerto Rican version
and not as neurotic.

72
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,105
So what do I call you?

73
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:22,900
You're actually waiting
for an answer this time.

74
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:24,007
Call me House.

75
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:26,453
<i>He's a brick</i>

76
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:31,766
Wait up.

77
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:33,642
I've already got
the whole place wired,

78
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,186
so I'll give you the rundown.
Yo, everybody!

79
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,845
This is my new roommate,
House, y'all.

80
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:41,209
- Main thing you got to know...
- Is this the line?

81
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,708
Hey, Gabby,
meet my new roommate, House.

82
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,149
- You can call him "Heezy."
- No, you can't.

83
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:48,132
Don't worry.
She won't call you anything.

84
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,398
She hasn't talked in, like,
ten years or something.

85
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,962
Good you came here.
You need to know the lay of the land.

86
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,497
I need to request a new room.

87
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,860
You're funny. You're also gonna
come here to get your meds.

88
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,378
- I'm not on any meds.
- You either? Good for you.

89
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:03,154
Tell me my mind works too fast.

90
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,777
Probably tell Usain Bolt
he runs too fast.

91
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:07,087
Excuse me.

92
00:07:07,212 --> 00:07:09,803
I know you're busy ignoring me,
but my minibar is empty.

93
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:12,927
You think bolt could do the long jump?
That sport needs to evolve.

94
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:15,238
Had the same world record for,
like, 20 years.

95
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:17,840
I think if one guy
launched himself headfirst

96
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:19,477
and right before he hits the ground

97
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:22,333
does a front flip instead,
get three extra feet out of that, easy.

98
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,751
Go be that man.

99
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:29,590
My head!

100
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:32,884
My head!

101
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:35,620
You're not getting any haldol.

102
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:37,344
Sorry.

103
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,417
That's Hal.
His real name is Connor,

104
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:42,210
- but we call him Hal...
- I got it.

105
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,325
We can't play that.
They keep it locked up.

106
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:50,224
I wish we could, but at the same time,
imagine how annoying that could be.

107
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:53,256
Crazy people playing on it all the time.
We'd never get any peace.

108
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,098
I want to introduce you
to everybody.

109
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:59,163
Do you think he's serious?
He's a doctor.

110
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,855
He knows that acting out
will only reinforce our diagnosis.

111
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,240
Or it'll work.

112
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:06,651
You think this is something
we should be concerned about?

113
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:09,362
A patient makes a threat,
you should always be concerned.

114
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,080
There are two new additions
to our ward.

115
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,557
You all know Alvie.

116
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:22,375
Thank you. Hold your applause.

117
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:25,521
It's great to be back here in Mayfield,
not just for the food,

118
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,213
not just for the ladies...

119
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,600
well, okay,
maybe just for the ladies.

120
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:32,000
And you should also welcome Greg
to the floor.

121
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,098
Don't worry about the name.
I'm just passing through.

122
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,733
Don't want to break any hearts.

123
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,183
Can we go outside now?

124
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:39,601
Not now, Jay.

125
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,437
So he's claustrophobic, right?
You're claustrophobic?

126
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,599
Can I get a pen
to write this stuff down?

127
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,944
Where are you going?

128
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,545
- Where's he going?
- It's okay.

129
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,112
Paranoid... check.

130
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,323
Dr. Beasley...

131
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:55,342
I am having an issue with the food.

132
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:58,119
- What's the problem?
- I swear I'm eating less and less,

133
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:01,206
and I just keep getting
bigger and bigger.

134
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:04,167
- A crayon? Anybody?
- We'll talk about it another time.

135
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:05,877
I understand you all

136
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:07,556
had art therapy yesterday.

137
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,215
Maybe we can hang some
of the new pieces on the wall.

138
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:11,951
Cut your wrists, huh?

139
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:15,323
- Greg, there are certain topics...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

140
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:16,846
Is suicide taboo?

141
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:19,057
Gosh, if I've broken a rule
on my first day,

142
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:20,850
I will kill myself.

143
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:23,854
Group's over.

144
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:26,248
That flew by.

145
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,029
You realize you're not
the first uncooperative patient

146
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:30,068
on this floor?

147
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:31,953
Really? Is there a club?

148
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:35,573
Come with me to the clubhouse.

149
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:40,986
That didn't take long.

150
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,311
I'm that good.

151
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:51,815
Come on.

152
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,440
Come on, Alvie!
Let's see some action!

153
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:56,761
You got nothing!

154
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,306
- Me, me.
- Pass, pass!

155
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:01,964
Good.

156
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,580
Come on, guys!

157
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,287
Ready to play nice?

158
00:10:08,412 --> 00:10:10,590
Would you believe me if I said yes?

159
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,861
Then, yes.

160
00:10:14,194 --> 00:10:15,864
You do know I'm trying to help you.

161
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:21,023
I also know you're trying
to be sweet, caring, and effective.

162
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:22,693
You're just not.

163
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:26,168
You want out.

164
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,168
Just talk.
Be honest.

165
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:32,212
Try to work with people.
Try to deal with people.

166
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:44,392
- He's on my team!
- Shut up. Nobody likes you.

167
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,289
Am I crowding you?
Can't see the sun?

168
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,358
No, everything is closing in.

169
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:58,173
He's the claustrophobic one, right?
'Cause I'm doing this from memory.

170
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,843
- You have to dribble.
- Why?

171
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,871
The CIA satellites aren't watching me.
They're watching you,

172
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:06,975
'cause you're wearing green.

173
00:11:09,979 --> 00:11:11,544
That one was just too easy.

174
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,713
Seriously, anorexia?

175
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:18,176
What, are you supposed to be a girl?
And in answer to your implicit question,

176
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,428
yes, those pants
do make you look fat.

177
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:30,150
How upset were you
when you woke up in the E.R.

178
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,732
and you were still alive
and a failure?

179
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:42,170
2-0, good guys!

180
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,082
You're right. It is rewarding
when you reach out.

181
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,717
You can't go up there.
It's yard time right now.

182
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:55,455
Put it on my tab.

183
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:21,786
I think you'll find
music therapy's more effective

184
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,137
if the patients are inside
to hear it.

185
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:29,502
Where'd you get the key?

186
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,120
They gave it to me.

187
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:36,132
So if she ever talks,

188
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,382
are we gonna get a German accent?

189
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:43,886
She's my husband's sister.

190
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:47,140
So let him come play the piano.

191
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,659
He doesn't know how to play.

192
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,670
Nice.

193
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,275
You're a little heavy
on the right foot, though.

194
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:01,279
See her head?

195
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:02,630
It bobs to the music.

196
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,075
It's the only real reaction
I'm getting from her.

197
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:11,122
It feels like we're talking.

198
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:13,958
You're not talking.

199
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:17,503
Her head is bobbing to her pulse.

200
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,630
Are you a new doctor on the ward?

201
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,525
Technically, yes.

202
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:26,763
Can I lead this time?

203
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,517
Leave the lid unlocked
when you're done.

204
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:03,147
Can you close the door?

205
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:05,093
You're letting all the cool air out.

206
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,891
If you keep up
this scorched-earth policy,

207
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,935
you're gonna end up
living in this room.

208
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:18,189
Are you ready to try another strategy,
or do you want me to leave you in here?

209
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:36,124
21. 2-1, that's game.
Hey, House is back.

210
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,709
I'll get the ball.

211
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:40,461
I need some meat.
I got no one left to play.

212
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,588
- I'll play you.
- Girl. Come on, House.

213
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:43,975
You can serve.

214
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,489
I've had some time
to think about the approach

215
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:51,782
I've been taking.

216
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,476
I know I'm unhappy here, and I...

217
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,311
I've been taking it out
on you guys...

218
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:00,323
unfairly.

219
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:03,253
It was...

220
00:15:04,324 --> 00:15:05,724
misdirected anger.

221
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,825
'cause when you think about it,
the real jerks here...

222
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:12,577
Are the doctors.

223
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:18,166
See how they give you
a ping-pong table,

224
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,423
but no paddles, no net?

225
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:22,003
It's like they're mocking you.

226
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,327
Preach!

227
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,215
The game is called table tennis,
not table volleyball.

228
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:28,391
Greg, you know where this
is gonna end.

229
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:31,029
Who ever saw
a tennis court without a net?

230
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:34,270
Little run-down park across
from my apartment growing up...

231
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:37,518
Three courts, no nets.
No one ever used it.

232
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:40,396
No one's gonna try to hang
themselves with a ping-pong net.

233
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:41,898
- No!
- Ridiculous.

234
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:43,707
You treat us like little kids.

235
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:45,952
Little kids are allowed
to play ping-pong,

236
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:49,155
- and they can play the piano.
- Yeah, worse than little kids.

237
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,525
All right, why don't we just go
and sit down

238
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,075
and discuss it?

239
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,783
No, I want to discuss it right here.

240
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:57,469
Guys.

241
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:01,810
Guys!

242
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:31,015
House is right.

243
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:33,407
I think everyone here
can handle these.

244
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,457
Seriously?

245
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:45,812
Is that your strategy... Give everybody
what they want except me?

246
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,985
You're a natural leader.

247
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,907
You could do something
useful down here, for them,

248
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:52,260
definitely for you.

249
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,842
Or we could keep fighting...

250
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,032
If you think you can break me,

251
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:01,227
if you think I'm not every bit
as stubborn as you.

252
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,604
<i>Came to fight the man
and he had the master plan</i>

253
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:15,792
<i>But it started to unravel
Nolan smashed him with his gavel</i>

254
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,617
- <i>Like blah!</i>
- Shut up.

255
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,491
So you gonna keep trying
to make them miserable?

256
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,623
New plan?

257
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,038
What is it?

258
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,044
I don't know yet.

259
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:29,671
<i>His mind is burning</i>

260
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:30,982
<i>The wheels are turning</i>

261
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,378
<i>The butter is churning</i>

262
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:34,951
<i>You think Nolan can keep
House from strolling?</i>

263
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,889
It's easier to come up
with a new plan in silence.

264
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:39,522
Right. Cool.

265
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:45,856
Can I hump?

266
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,776
I'd like you all to welcome
another new addition to our ward...

267
00:17:56,102 --> 00:17:56,913
Steve.

268
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,248
Freedom master.

269
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:01,292
Steve Elkerton is just a cover.

270
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:03,628
It's like Clark Kent
or Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker.

271
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,616
Cool.
We got more jesuses than superheroes.

272
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:08,679
I try to blend in
in the outside world,

273
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:10,234
but I figure in here,

274
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,011
everybody gets it.

275
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:14,556
We're living in the ward of justice.

276
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:19,143
Can you explain a little more
about what you think everybody gets?

277
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,063
There's good and evil in the world.

278
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:23,212
And some people are... special,

279
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:25,847
and they're chosen to help keep
evil forces at bay.

280
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,485
You don't think
you can stop bullets, do you?

281
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,384
I move out of their way.

282
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:31,823
Can you read minds?

283
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:37,619
It's group time, Greg.

284
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:40,747
Why isn't she talking?

285
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:45,352
She needs help.

286
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:47,862
She needs somebody to save her.

287
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:50,248
That's what we're all trying to do.

288
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,304
Let's take five minutes.
Everybody get to know Steve.

289
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,575
I can fly.

290
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:05,641
I know you're scheming,

291
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:09,078
working on your next elaborate
plan to get out of here.

292
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:12,665
Why don't you put the plan
on hold for a few days?

293
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:14,146
See what happens.

294
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,334
Just let me do my job.

295
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:19,483
If you prefer private to group,
we can do that,

296
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,422
maybe try some SSRIs.

297
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:24,000
If you think nothing's working,
you can always go

298
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,600
back to your schemes.

299
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:28,378
God, if only you'd said that
two minutes ago,

300
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:30,363
before I came up with my new scheme.

301
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:31,888
Now I'm committed.

302
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:33,831
Get it?

303
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:37,740
<i>Shaq up in my area</i>

304
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:39,724
<i>I'm a better baller
and a better rapper</i>

305
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:42,289
<i>And I'm good at basketball too</i>

306
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:46,179
Do you have third-floor privileges?

307
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:49,070
Ever since I shared in group
about my uncle fondling me.

308
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:52,011
Is that true?

309
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,138
And now I can use the
third-floor vending machines.

310
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:58,432
You eat sour cream and onion chips?
The whole point is the dipping.

311
00:19:58,557 --> 00:20:00,874
Sure, we save time by not adding
the mix and sour cream,

312
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,539
- but you're missing out on...
- Break into Nolan's office.

313
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:06,334
- Commando style.
- I want you to focus.

314
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:09,128
- You want me to mess him up?
- Go into Nolan's office.

315
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:12,298
Look at his calendar. I need the name
of the woman he met with at 11:00 today.

316
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:15,385
No problem. And I'll get you
some chips. If they have them,

317
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:18,196
I'll get you some dip, but I've never
seen dip in the vending machine.

318
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:19,580
Get me chips and dip.

319
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:22,266
- What else?
- I get it, I get it. Plan "B".

320
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:24,644
"B" is for blackmail.
I got you covered.

321
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,317
Commando style.

322
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:08,640
Let me go!

323
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:11,062
I just wanted a little snack.
That ain't right!

324
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,609
Yo, I didn't know
the machine was moved!

325
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:15,236
I want some ritz bits!

326
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,602
I might be pregnant!
I get these cravings!

327
00:21:23,728 --> 00:21:24,787
You get the name?

328
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:27,749
Nolan's schedule book has a big "x"
marking out the whole middle of the day.

329
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,918
Then we can assume the girl
he's with is called "nooner".

330
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,080
<i>Nooner, nooner
Nolan's gonna spoon her</i>

331
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,716
- He's gonna "fork" her.
- <i>And then he's gonna knife her</i>

332
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,425
I didn't check the phone
or anything else.

333
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,650
That's okay.

334
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:44,075
I got her license plate.
I call my friend. He gets the name.

335
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,933
I get the letter
that gets me out of here.

336
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:47,874
You got phone privileges?

337
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:51,063
I'm on level minus four.
I'm still writing with a crayon.

338
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,940
You? You got to be at level five.

339
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:54,859
That's like the top
of the space needle.

340
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,029
Hal's the only one
that's up that high.

341
00:21:57,836 --> 00:21:59,071
Hal's at level five?

342
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,406
They give him a point
every time he clears his plate.

343
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:03,201
I've been eating his potatoes.

344
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,711
- Will he sell you some minutes?
- I pay two cigarettes for the potatoes.

345
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:08,428
Phone's worth a lot more.

346
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:12,334
Can you cheek a pill?

347
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:17,613
That's too bad for you.

348
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:27,057
You sure you're good with this?

349
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:29,644
Got to be done.

350
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:32,374
So how do we start?

351
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:34,909
I think we just start.

352
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,101
Make it good. Make it real.

353
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,105
Just do it already.

354
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:52,583
Code gray!

355
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:55,169
Give me five milligrams of haldol!

356
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,132
Help! Get him off me!

357
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:07,107
Give it to him!

358
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:31,330
Dude, that was awesome.

359
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:39,597
Think Hal will mind if they're wet?

360
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:50,558
No, it's your other friend
at the asylum.

361
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:52,859
How's it going?

362
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:55,354
Hallucinations are gone,
so is the vicodin.

363
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:58,299
How's the leg?
How's the pain?

364
00:23:58,424 --> 00:24:00,401
<i>They got me on some nonnarcotic.</i>

365
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,070
I'm dealing.
I need you to run a license plate.

366
00:24:03,863 --> 00:24:05,573
Was there a hit-and-run
on your floor?

367
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:08,284
<i>House, just do
what you're supposed to do.</i>

368
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,327
Listen to the doctors,

369
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:11,970
<i>and I'll be able</i> <i>to visit soon.</i>

370
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:14,790
Track down the owner of this car,
and I'll be able to visit you

371
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:17,793
<i>in your office tomorrow.
My doctor is too smart,</i>

372
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,546
too old, and too well-dressed
to only be running one ward.

373
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:23,799
<i>He screwed up something in his life,
and I think he's doing it again.</i>

374
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:26,052
I need her name so I can
blackmail the blackmailer.

375
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:28,743
He called me.

376
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:32,099
Why?

377
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,728
He wanted to know about you.

378
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,870
<i>He wanted to warn me
that you'd be calling for something.</i>

379
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:41,684
And he told me if I wanted
to help you get better,

380
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,444
I had to let him do his job.

381
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,410
Now I'm calling you to
tell you that if he calls you...

382
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,307
I'm so sorry.

383
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:50,201
I wish I could help you.

384
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:51,452
You can.

385
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:03,296
It turns out...

386
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:07,551
You're my only friend.

387
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:13,010
<i>House ain't a newbie,
now he living on this floor</i>

388
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:15,351
And I hate you.

389
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,716
I'm gonna cooperate.

390
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:23,758
That's not much of a plan.
That's actually their plan.

391
00:25:23,883 --> 00:25:27,516
No, I'm pretty sure their plan is for me
to actually swallow the pills,

392
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:29,557
to actually cooperate.

393
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,555
I'm so proud of my little roomie.

394
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:36,932
I only taught him
everything he knows.

395
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:39,793
One, two, three.

396
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:44,440
Stomp, you start the betting.

397
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:46,373
Highest card wins.

398
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,619
That's probably a fold.
Richter.

399
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:51,732
Two cigarettes.

400
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,035
He's not confident, Alvie.

401
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:55,172
Crush him,

402
00:26:55,593 --> 00:26:57,286
in the form of a rhyme if you want.

403
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,587
<i>No regrets, raise ten cigarettes</i>

404
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:04,196
That's a lot of nerve
for someone with a two on their head.

405
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,612
You're messing with me.

406
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:07,797
You can't raise ten.
I only have five.

407
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,295
- Throw in your phone card.
- I'm not gonna throw in it.

408
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:12,287
Can I play?

409
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:14,829
- Come here.
- Why?

410
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:19,083
I wanna see if you've got what it takes.
Give me your best poker face.

411
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:25,256
Too rich for my blood.
You can take my seat.

412
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,198
Med time!

413
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:30,581
How are you feeling today?

414
00:27:30,706 --> 00:27:32,972
Better than yesterday,
not as good as tomorrow.

415
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:55,161
I've been humming to her.

416
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:59,165
She sways.
It might be significant.

417
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:04,963
Are you ignoring me, or are you letting
my charm wash over you?

418
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:09,606
Kind of tough to play and chat.

419
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,873
A couple of weeks ago, you told me

420
00:28:12,998 --> 00:28:15,463
playing to her
was a complete waste of time.

421
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:19,908
You're right. Your playing
does get worse when you talk.

422
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:23,147
I assume she loved music.

423
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:26,040
She played
for the Philadelphia philharmonic...

424
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:27,277
Cello.

425
00:28:27,646 --> 00:28:30,571
If she responded to the piano, she might
respond even better to the cello.

426
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,229
I play a little.

427
00:28:36,742 --> 00:28:38,641
Maybe I'll bring one in tuesday.

428
00:28:39,556 --> 00:28:40,556
Thank you.

429
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:47,754
Different desk, different doctor.

430
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:49,669
You've been on meds for a while now.

431
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,058
I'll be checking in with you
to see if we need to adjust your dose.

432
00:28:53,183 --> 00:28:55,513
Any dry mouth, trouble sleeping?

433
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,599
Can I go now?

434
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,060
There's a manic out there
with a fresh carton of cigarettes,

435
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,123
and he's a terrible bluffer.

436
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:06,568
It's nice to see that you
and Alvie are friends again.

437
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:09,650
- Tell me about your fight.
- He hit me. I hit him back.

438
00:29:10,061 --> 00:29:11,737
Repeat until pulpy.

439
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,989
Alvie told me
you instigated the thing.

440
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:16,200
That tends to be
the way fights work...

441
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,813
Different interpretations
of the same circumstances.

442
00:29:18,938 --> 00:29:20,439
Very understanding attitude.

443
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:22,457
- There's that tone again.
- You're smart.

444
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:26,627
How come every time you compliment me,
it sounds like an accusation?

445
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:29,380
You're not having any side effects
from your meds, which is unusual.

446
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,258
- It's not that unusual.
- The fight isn't adding up.

447
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,172
Why don't you stop pretending
that you haven't reached a conclusion?

448
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:37,116
You don't trust me.

449
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:39,515
Actually, it's more fundamental
than that. You don't like me.

450
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:42,643
- I didn't say that.
- You think I'm not taking my meds.

451
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:44,062
Are you?

452
00:29:46,131 --> 00:29:48,695
So what do you want me to do?
Want me to take a urine test?

453
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,620
Will that earn your trust?

454
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:52,737
Actually, yeah.

455
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:05,876
Have at it.

456
00:30:06,784 --> 00:30:08,267
A little dignity, please.

457
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,532
You know the rules.
I have to watch.

458
00:30:10,657 --> 00:30:12,465
But you don't have
to have courtside seats.

459
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:14,440
Can I at least use a stall?

460
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:43,287
<i>For he himself has said it</i>

461
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:48,042
<i>And it's greatly to his credit</i>

462
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,338
<i>That he is an Englishman</i>

463
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:54,629
<i>He is...</i>

464
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,939
<i>an Englishman</i>

465
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,619
Get it while it's hot.

466
00:31:32,987 --> 00:31:34,475
I'm sorry I doubted you.

467
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:40,519
Freedom Master,
think you could help me out?

468
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:42,727
You need help?

469
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:43,806
Of course...

470
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:45,671
- That's what I do.
- Great.

471
00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:47,690
Could you move the piano?

472
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,140
500 pounds.
That's not too much, is it?

473
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,248
Is there something
trapped underneath or...?

474
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:56,694
No. I just want to move it
away from the window.

475
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,000
- My powers aren't for frivolous...
- Just one lift.

476
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:03,027
- Why are you doing that?
- House, it's none of your business.

477
00:32:05,747 --> 00:32:08,122
I'm curious.
As a doctor, what are you doing?

478
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,673
Either he is Freedom Master,
and he shouldn't be here,

479
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:13,567
or else he's suffering
from a serious and dangerous delusion

480
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:15,208
that he needs to deal with.

481
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,133
So...

482
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:18,101
Legit medical reasons.

483
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:21,135
You're not trying to break him
because he's a little different.

484
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:23,697
He's not different.
He's delusional.

485
00:32:23,822 --> 00:32:26,043
- Can you help me out?
- What is she looking at?

486
00:32:26,168 --> 00:32:28,459
You're not a superhero, Steven.

487
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,778
- You're a regular person.
- I can save her.

488
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:32,366
We're all just regular people.

489
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,906
- It's what we do.
- They stole her voice box.

490
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,319
They have it in there.
That's what she's staring at.

491
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:41,030
That's what she's staring at.

492
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:42,588
Your wife is dead.

493
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,921
- Good can defeat evil.
- Not every time.

494
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:54,172
Evil people killed a lot
of good people that day.

495
00:32:54,297 --> 00:32:56,170
You couldn't save her.
No one could.

496
00:32:57,773 --> 00:32:58,973
It's in there.

497
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:00,856
Her voice is in there.

498
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:02,622
Her voice is in there.

499
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:03,818
Code gray.

500
00:33:04,477 --> 00:33:05,777
Her voice is in...

501
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:17,725
Don't do it.

502
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,576
I'm not doing anything.

503
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:20,922
You're thinking.

504
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:23,814
Things go from thinking to doing
way too fast in this place.

505
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,733
Keep thinking, you're gonna
wind up with no mo in your mojo.

506
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:30,058
- I'm thinking of hitting you again.
- You hate Medina. You hate all of them.

507
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:33,199
You want to hurt them. Keep pretending.
Step away from the hate.

508
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:36,409
What's the difference
between pretending to cooperate

509
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:37,776
and cooperating?

510
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:39,664
Pretending is pretending.
It's not real.

511
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:40,996
You don't mean it.

512
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:44,030
I sat and watched while he did
something stupid and pointless.

513
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,843
- I cooperated.
- Soon, you won't have to watch,

514
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:48,437
because you're going home.

515
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:50,257
You'll be getting your job back.

516
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,109
Everybody inside!

517
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:53,719
Closing ceremonies.

518
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,017
Everyone attends.
One of you is going home.

519
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:02,075
It's been a great week.

520
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:05,314
A number of you
have made tremendous strides.

521
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,275
But today we're here to congratulate

522
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:09,286
Susan.

523
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,275
We're proud of her!

524
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,284
We wish her well, and we hope...

525
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:20,292
to never see her again!

526
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:44,103
- Where's Freedom Master?
- He isn't able to take part.

527
00:34:55,977 --> 00:34:58,409
Get out there.
They said everybody has to get out.

528
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:01,199
Talk!
Say something!

529
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,060
- Leave him alone.
- Did you drug him?

530
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:07,293
Of course I didn't drug him.

531
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,767
He's in flat affect.
He's practically catatonic.

532
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:10,963
Hey, we got cake.

533
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:12,840
- He's fine.
- Double chocolate.

534
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:15,634
Don't tell me that he's fine!
You did this!

535
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,303
He was functioning.

536
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,886
- He was happy.
- He was delusional.

537
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:21,690
He's way better off now.

538
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:24,727
Let's talk.

539
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:32,788
Thinking sucks.

540
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:38,170
I'm not allowed to get angry?

541
00:35:38,295 --> 00:35:39,444
They screwed him up.

542
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:41,469
And for the record...

543
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:45,737
I am two privilege levels above Susan,
and I got the same depression-scale.

544
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:47,792
Every patient is different.
It's not about scores

545
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,962
- and levels and...
- Happiness is happiness.

546
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:51,664
Test is test.
Coping is coping.

547
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:53,923
- And you think you're...
- Absolutely!

548
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:57,082
I need to address
some deeper issues,

549
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:59,428
which I can do
on an outpatient basis.

550
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:00,888
3 hours a week?

551
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:03,390
That's my opening offer.
If you want to counter, I'll fold.

552
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:06,794
"No" is not an argument.

553
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:09,230
- Are you trying to frustrate me?
- No.

554
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,821
"No" again?

555
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:12,481
I can cope!

556
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:14,450
I'm coping.
In fact...

557
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:16,773
I'm coping better than you think.

558
00:36:18,004 --> 00:36:19,907
I've not been taking my meds,

559
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:21,267
not one.

560
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:24,537
And, I still scored a "high functioning"
on your depression test.

561
00:36:25,189 --> 00:36:27,748
So your proof of your well-being
is that you lied?

562
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:29,121
Manipulated.

563
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:30,668
My proof is

564
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:33,901
that I can fool the test and you,
which means I am high functioning.

565
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,966
I am sane, rational, capable.
I should not be here.

566
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,861
These are your pills from today?

567
00:36:39,471 --> 00:36:42,221
I'm not gonna take it.
I'll just cheek it again.

568
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:46,608
Lick it.

569
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,563
- You want me to lick your hand?
- I washed.

570
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:56,485
It's sugar.

571
00:36:59,196 --> 00:37:01,240
Your test results
were improving too regularly

572
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,992
and too quickly.

573
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:06,197
I was concerned that you weren't
taking your pills, that it was an act,

574
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:08,477
so I switched you to a placebo...

575
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,459
to see if your...

576
00:37:13,017 --> 00:37:14,559
Improvements would continue.

577
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:18,377
Your psych tests told me nothing,

578
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:19,800
but your urine tests

579
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:21,302
told me you were faking.

580
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:25,222
You need to stop
fighting the system.

581
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:28,454
You need to let me do my job.

582
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:36,896
So...
What's the next plan?

583
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,796
There is no new plan.

584
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:44,128
I'm out of plans.

585
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:45,799
So what do we do?

586
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:47,486
We stop talking.

587
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:26,489
I see you've got some cello
in your trunk.

588
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,863
And, no, that's not a euphemism.

589
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:32,923
Are you spying on me?

590
00:38:33,456 --> 00:38:35,197
I'm living
in a psychiatric hospital.

591
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:37,613
Staring out of the window
is what we do.

592
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:40,191
I assume you'll need help
carrying it up.

593
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:42,462
I still got grounds privileges.

594
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:46,220
And who's going to carry you
when you're carrying the cello?

595
00:38:46,732 --> 00:38:49,040
Yes, cast aside
the useless cripple...

596
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:50,681
How very German of you.

597
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:54,307
Seriously, the thing
weighs a ton with that case.

598
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,857
- I think i'll need a dolly.
- Or we could ask Clark Kent

599
00:38:58,025 --> 00:38:58,994
to pitch in.

600
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:02,449
- The dolly's probably easier.
- The dolly...

601
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,300
already feels good about itself.

602
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:06,635
He was a happy-go-lucky superhero

603
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:08,493
until they told him
he has no powers.

604
00:39:08,823 --> 00:39:11,203
We let him help out,
he feels good about himself.

605
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:12,948
Might be less depressed.

606
00:39:16,672 --> 00:39:18,598
Why do you put your life on hold

607
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,881
to visit your sister-in-law
five times a week?

608
00:39:22,114 --> 00:39:24,259
Am I somehow a bad person
for showing compassion?

609
00:39:25,557 --> 00:39:28,527
You're not even a bad person
for lying about why you're doing it.

610
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:32,562
That is impressive.

611
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:35,896
That is a superhuman feat.

612
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,047
Why don't you take a rest
before flying that thing up to the ward?

613
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,094
He's still depressed.

614
00:39:49,394 --> 00:39:50,577
Give me your keys.

615
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:53,505
You gonna dangle them in front
of him to entertain him?

616
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,492
I'm gonna make him feel
like he's flying.

617
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:57,459
I'll drive him around the grounds,
top down,

618
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:58,818
wind in his hair.

619
00:40:00,713 --> 00:40:01,813
Seriously...

620
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,775
you're gonna say no to that?

621
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,301
Why are you so nice to me?

622
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:23,314
I think you have a good heart.

623
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:26,363
Would you still be nice to me
if I told you that I lied?

624
00:40:27,663 --> 00:40:29,791
I'm not just driving
around the grounds.

625
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:31,660
I'm kidnapping him
and stealing your car.

626
00:40:38,418 --> 00:40:39,418
You sure?

627
00:40:40,111 --> 00:40:42,199
I was starting to feel
a little heat between us.

628
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:44,339
Thought we had kind
of a "Bonnie and Clyde" thing.

629
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,967
Bonnie and clyde get shot to pieces.

630
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:49,507
See you.

631
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,909
You can do this.

632
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,036
If you hold my hand,
I can do it too.

633
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:48,478
Don't let go!

634
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:51,068
Going up!

635
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,977
Freedom Master's back!

636
00:42:08,622 --> 00:42:10,572
Keep it down, freedom master.

637
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:12,786
You're scaring the good citizens.

638
00:42:13,591 --> 00:42:16,187
- It was the coolest moment of my life.
- It was fun.

639
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:19,105
You can repay me
by telling Nolan he's an idiot.

640
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:20,724
Smell that fresh air

641
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:22,887
and the warmth of your yellow sun.

642
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:24,262
We do enjoy it.

643
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:27,531
Careful of the traffic.

644
00:42:28,216 --> 00:42:30,272
Don't go damaging any fenders.

645
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:35,617
Come on, get down.

646
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:39,037
There's no cry for help.

647
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:40,701
There's no cat in a tree.

648
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:45,800
Thank you, Greg.

649
00:42:58,469 --> 00:42:59,891
He's lucky to be alive.

650
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:02,727
He's got a lacerated spleen,

651
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:04,395
rotational pelvic fracture,

652
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:06,834
compound break
of the femur and humerus.

653
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:11,111
Everything in your life has been
about finding the truth.

654
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:12,996
But suddenly, with this guy,

655
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:16,324
you decide to reinforce
a sick man's delusions.

656
00:43:19,172 --> 00:43:20,970
You just wanted to take
a swing at me.

657
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:24,728
You don't care about getting out.

658
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:26,288
You don't care about him.

659
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:28,600
You don't even care about the truth.

660
00:43:31,518 --> 00:43:33,133
You don't care about anything.

661
00:43:35,603 --> 00:43:37,562
I'm transferring you
to Winslow psychiatric.

662
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:40,445
You'll have better luck pulling
the wool over their eyes. I'm done.

663
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:43,245
Don't.

664
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:50,221
I need help.

665
00:44:09,144 --> 00:44:10,613
So how is this supposed to work?

666
00:44:10,738 --> 00:44:12,983
You sit. I sit.
We talk.

667
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,042
- About what?
- About whatever you want.

668
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:18,754
- You want me to whine about my mother?
- You want to whine about your mother?

669
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:22,258
I can tell you about the time
I was five and my goldfish died.

670
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,781
If that's where you'd like to start.

671
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:29,289
I've had a billion things happen to me.
How can I know which ones are relevant?

672
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:32,233
- As far as I'm concerned, they're all.
- Well, we better get moving,

673
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:34,503
'cause this session
could take 50 years.

674
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:37,413
Yes, you are the sum
of everything that's happened to you.

675
00:44:37,538 --> 00:44:40,526
And, yes, some events
are more relevant than others.

676
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:43,529
But the only way
we can figure out which ones are

677
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:44,747
is to talk.

678
00:44:45,694 --> 00:44:46,574
So tell me,

679
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:48,568
what's on your mind?

680
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:50,411
What do you want?

681
00:44:53,715 --> 00:44:55,257
I want to get better...

682
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,100
whatever the hell that means.

683
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:02,881
- I'm sick of being miserable.
- So you'd like to be happy?

684
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:05,780
Again with the reflecting...
Yes, I'd like to be happy.

685
00:45:05,905 --> 00:45:07,852
Being happy is an excellent goal.

686
00:45:07,977 --> 00:45:09,757
Not many patients can crystallize

687
00:45:09,882 --> 00:45:11,724
what they're hoping
to get out of this.

688
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:15,073
- Well, bully for me.
- So now all we have to do

689
00:45:15,198 --> 00:45:17,613
is figure out how to get you
from here...

690
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,167
to happy.

691
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:22,234
SSRIS?

692
00:45:22,672 --> 00:45:24,236
That's your genius technique?

693
00:45:24,562 --> 00:45:26,873
I don't think we should ignore
any tools that can help.

694
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,563
I know you don't have
a problem taking drugs.

695
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,540
For my leg, for pain.

696
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:34,038
Think of this
as being for psychic pain.

697
00:45:37,312 --> 00:45:38,876
I don't want to change who I am.

698
00:45:39,688 --> 00:45:40,688
Miserable?

699
00:45:45,425 --> 00:45:47,319
Do you think that by taking meds

700
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,714
you'll lose your edge,

701
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:51,764
stop making the unique connections
that make you a successful doctor?

702
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,600
If Van Gogh was your patient,

703
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:57,547
he'd be satisfied painting houses
instead of <i>The Starry night</i>.

704
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,149
Van gogh would still be making inspired
paintings of the night sky,

705
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,734
just maybe not
from the room of his asylum.

706
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:05,397
- You don't know that.
- I know

707
00:46:05,522 --> 00:46:07,763
both his ears would be intact.

708
00:46:09,354 --> 00:46:10,831
And I know his life...

709
00:46:11,516 --> 00:46:12,640
would be better.

710
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:25,755
I know this doesn't come
naturally to you.

711
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:28,384
But you want my help,

712
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:30,849
which means you need to trust me.

713
00:46:43,649 --> 00:46:44,649
Delicious.

714
00:46:56,264 --> 00:46:57,614
Why are you here?

715
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm waiting for my communion wafer.

716
00:47:08,632 --> 00:47:10,152
You're cheeking it, right?

717
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:11,527
Nope.

718
00:47:12,198 --> 00:47:13,718
Tell me you're cheeking it.

719
00:47:14,972 --> 00:47:16,222
I swallowed it.

720
00:47:16,669 --> 00:47:18,066
We don't take meds.

721
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:20,956
You don't take meds, Alvie.
I decided to get sane.

722
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,247
You're scamming again.
You can tell me.

723
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:24,917
I'm not scamming, Alvie.

724
00:47:26,065 --> 00:47:27,315
They broke you.

725
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:32,851
They didn't break me.

726
00:47:33,474 --> 00:47:34,574
I am broken.

727
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:40,497
Now stop worshipping me and go and worry
about your own loser life.

728
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:45,769
I hate you.

729
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:59,391
- Prom?
- Got an assignment for you.

730
00:47:59,805 --> 00:48:00,955
Role-playing?

731
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:04,640
I'm not sure how pretending
to be a businessman

732
00:48:04,765 --> 00:48:07,361
with a foot fetish is gonna help,
but I'm game.

733
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:10,235
Have you connected
with any of the other patients?

734
00:48:11,334 --> 00:48:13,739
You've been here 4 weeks.
Tell me about your relationships

735
00:48:13,907 --> 00:48:15,395
with the other patients.

736
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:17,197
Diane...

737
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,163
is convinced
that silent girl hates her.

738
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:23,566
Richter's not as paranoid as you think.
He just likes that you think that.

739
00:48:24,273 --> 00:48:25,584
And my roommate hates me.

740
00:48:25,879 --> 00:48:29,213
Only one of the things indicated
how somebody else feels about you.

741
00:48:29,636 --> 00:48:30,439
So...

742
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,814
I'm sure that they've done

743
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:36,637
some form of rudimentary analysis on me,
concluded that I'm a jerk.

744
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:39,811
You know, there is a way
for them to find out things about you

745
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:41,535
without deductive reasoning.

746
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:43,227
I have had relationships.

747
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:46,528
You've screwed up relationships,
every one of them...

748
00:48:46,653 --> 00:48:48,281
Almost like that was the goal.

749
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:49,858
I want you

750
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:51,247
to trust...

751
00:48:52,822 --> 00:48:53,593
people.

752
00:48:55,672 --> 00:48:56,448
Try.

753
00:49:00,093 --> 00:49:01,193
Get dressed.

754
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:21,839
Just open up?

755
00:49:23,986 --> 00:49:25,136
Just open up.

756
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,311
Trust.

757
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:27,758
Strangers?

758
00:49:28,357 --> 00:49:31,090
We'll start with strangers,
then work our way up.

759
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:36,905
If it helps, I find "hello"
to be an excellent icebreaker.

760
00:49:50,272 --> 00:49:52,375
It's like "hello," only shorter.

761
00:49:56,281 --> 00:49:58,222
I'm glad we were able
to save that time.

762
00:49:58,347 --> 00:50:01,013
Judging by the fancy suit,
I'd say you were a donor.

763
00:50:01,538 --> 00:50:04,474
The nervous demeanor
says maybe you've had issues,

764
00:50:04,895 --> 00:50:07,561
probably is why this place
has personal meaning.

765
00:50:08,992 --> 00:50:10,876
But this is supposed to be about me.

766
00:50:12,726 --> 00:50:14,234
I take advantage of my friends.

767
00:50:16,836 --> 00:50:18,131
Friend, really...

768
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:19,983
I've only got one.

769
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:22,159
It can be tough.

770
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:24,995
- I'm not gay.
- Oh, neither am i.

771
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,540
Actually, I am.

772
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:28,916
See that guy over there?

773
00:50:30,499 --> 00:50:31,699
He's my lover.

774
00:50:32,169 --> 00:50:35,464
He's also my psychiatrist, which some
would argue is a little inappropriate,

775
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,619
but they just don't know
what love is.

776
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:38,675
Am I right?

777
00:50:44,913 --> 00:50:46,001
You're not gay.

778
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:49,853
No, but I have to tell
intimate secrets to people.

779
00:50:51,374 --> 00:50:52,814
Maybe they should be true.

780
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:55,081
Hadn't thought of that.

781
00:50:55,206 --> 00:50:57,242
To be on the safe side,
I should do both,

782
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:58,747
starting with the fun ones.

783
00:50:58,872 --> 00:51:00,654
Come on, let's get me better.

784
00:51:17,672 --> 00:51:19,072
I'm a philanderer.

785
00:51:21,802 --> 00:51:24,096
Philanderer doesn't mean
that I give a lot to charity.

786
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:26,056
- It means...
- I know what it means.

787
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:30,079
You were asking me

788
00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:32,234
if there were any nuts
in the <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>.

789
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:33,327
What?

790
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,148
Honey.

791
00:51:36,242 --> 00:51:38,062
What did my husband just say to you?

792
00:51:41,346 --> 00:51:42,147
I...

793
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,102
was asking him if there were nuts...

794
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:47,632
in the <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>.

795
00:51:47,757 --> 00:51:50,420
- Then where is your EpiPen?
- My what?

796
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:53,291
No one with an allergy would
walk around without an EpiPen.

797
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:55,502
- Give me your purse.
- Stop!

798
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:56,745
- Come...
- No.

799
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,463
What really happened

800
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:00,410
is...

801
00:52:01,427 --> 00:52:03,027
I thought he was cute.

802
00:52:03,961 --> 00:52:04,928
I hit on him.

803
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:06,619
We're going.

804
00:52:14,755 --> 00:52:16,005
You having fun?

805
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:19,401
I did connect with one guy.

806
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,775
But then my propensity
for screwing things up overtook me.

807
00:52:24,628 --> 00:52:26,319
Then my desire to have fun

808
00:52:26,564 --> 00:52:28,203
overcame my propensity.

809
00:52:28,471 --> 00:52:29,873
You didn't screw it up.

810
00:52:30,476 --> 00:52:33,415
The assignment wasn't to get you
to trust with a piece of your soul.

811
00:52:33,872 --> 00:52:36,626
The assignment was to teach you
that you can trust.

812
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:41,798
Did any of these people rat you out
as the obnoxious womanizer

813
00:52:42,132 --> 00:52:44,176
or the porn producer
that they think you are?

814
00:52:46,378 --> 00:52:47,345
Why do you think

815
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:50,810
that people would treat you
worse if they knew the truth?

816
00:52:55,748 --> 00:52:57,198
Good night, doctor.

817
00:53:01,276 --> 00:53:02,667
Are you in trouble?

818
00:53:05,272 --> 00:53:06,522
Apparently not.

819
00:53:07,002 --> 00:53:08,252
So what's next?

820
00:53:08,993 --> 00:53:10,363
You want to be my pimp?

821
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:15,290
Why don't we just talk?

822
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:23,381
How come you weren't pissed
at me for stealing your car?

823
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,885
It was a nice thing to do.

824
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:31,139
I'm not sure about the German-English
translation of nice.

825
00:53:31,602 --> 00:53:33,016
The stealing was nice or...

826
00:53:34,816 --> 00:53:36,786
ruining Freedom Master's life?

827
00:53:37,905 --> 00:53:39,731
What you did was misguided

828
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:42,141
and irresponsible,

829
00:53:43,128 --> 00:53:44,678
but it was also nice.

830
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,666
You gave him a moment
of pure happiness.

831
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:54,746
You asked me why I come here
so often to visit Annie.

832
00:53:56,774 --> 00:53:58,348
She was my best friend.

833
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,438
Then she started pulling away...

834
00:54:02,658 --> 00:54:03,908
from everybody.

835
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:06,405
The doctors don't know why.

836
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:08,711
I think

837
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:11,338
I married her brother because...

838
00:54:12,425 --> 00:54:15,926
he was the only other one
who was going through the same thing.

839
00:54:18,924 --> 00:54:21,342
But he stopped visiting
after a couple of years.

840
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,055
I just...

841
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:25,989
couldn't stop.

842
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:29,780
I miss her.

843
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:40,041
I should go.

844
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:43,996
Good night.

845
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:57,591
Good night.

846
00:55:18,301 --> 00:55:19,651
So what happened?

847
00:55:21,138 --> 00:55:23,140
- You're talking to me now.
- No.

848
00:55:30,905 --> 00:55:31,955
Was it fun?

849
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:44,140
She kissed me.

850
00:55:45,355 --> 00:55:47,175
Don't read into the phrasing.

851
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:49,101
We kissed each other.

852
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:50,679
And how do you feel?

853
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,837
How do I feel?
It was a kiss.

854
00:55:52,962 --> 00:55:54,641
Kisses are good things.

855
00:55:58,665 --> 00:56:00,022
That was a loaded "okay."

856
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:02,232
Not at all.
Why would you assume that?

857
00:56:02,478 --> 00:56:04,169
'Cause you're being judgmental.

858
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:07,981
If I had said that I'd had a delicious
Chilean sea bass for dinner,

859
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:09,823
would you say,
"And how do you feel?"

860
00:56:10,024 --> 00:56:11,650
If the sea bass was married,
I might.

861
00:56:12,284 --> 00:56:14,118
See, you're being judgmental.

862
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:17,441
Isn't that against your code
or something?

863
00:56:17,566 --> 00:56:18,957
I'm simply stating the obvious.

864
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:21,494
It's complicated,
not just because she's married

865
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:24,171
and not just because
you're institutionalized.

866
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,058
I know you spent the last 12 hours

867
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,219
trying to figure out
what that kiss means.

868
00:56:30,372 --> 00:56:32,325
Who's that woman you were with

869
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,764
in the parking lot?

870
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,696
When you deflect,

871
00:56:35,821 --> 00:56:38,323
it's more effective
when you're not that transparent.

872
00:56:38,448 --> 00:56:40,562
Obviously you have no problem
with the infidelity.

873
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:42,795
You're trying to rationalize that,

874
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,775
"if it's okay for your doctor,
it's okay."

875
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,360
But for the record,

876
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:48,645
- I am not having an affair.
- Then who is she?

877
00:56:48,813 --> 00:56:51,563
Why are you working so hard
to figure out the details of my life?

878
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:54,534
I might not have to work so hard
if there were personal items in here.

879
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,578
You got one number on speed dial.

880
00:56:56,779 --> 00:56:57,979
It says "Dad".

881
00:56:58,428 --> 00:56:59,915
Come on, how old are you?

882
00:57:00,244 --> 00:57:02,709
- Why are you so afraid?
- I want to talk about you.

883
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:04,332
I want to know whogives me advice.

884
00:57:04,457 --> 00:57:06,546
I'm not giving you advice.
I'm asking questions.

885
00:57:06,747 --> 00:57:09,466
I think that kiss meant a lot.
I think that scares you.

886
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:11,800
I think there are
no personal items in here

887
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:13,470
because you have no personal life.

888
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:15,503
How do you think
you and Lydia will end?

889
00:57:15,882 --> 00:57:17,313
You are a lonely man.

890
00:57:17,438 --> 00:57:19,601
You've screwed up every
opportunity you've had.

891
00:57:19,802 --> 00:57:21,428
What's the ending to the story?

892
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,933
I don't know.

893
00:57:32,435 --> 00:57:33,635
Visiting time!

894
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:55,053
Why did you kiss me?

895
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:01,810
How many reasons are there?

896
00:58:03,201 --> 00:58:04,251
I like you.

897
00:58:05,017 --> 00:58:07,678
It felt like a nice way
of showing you that.

898
00:58:30,972 --> 00:58:33,341
Open it all the way.
Keep it open.

899
00:58:57,261 --> 00:58:58,717
How'd it go with Lydia?

900
00:58:58,842 --> 00:59:01,328
I found out
you can only be happy so long

901
00:59:01,453 --> 00:59:03,779
before the catatonic guy
with two broken limbs

902
00:59:03,904 --> 00:59:05,624
rolls off the elevator,

903
00:59:05,983 --> 00:59:07,626
philosophically speaking.

904
00:59:08,027 --> 00:59:10,629
Why do you value your failures
more than your successes?

905
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,758
My mother caught me masturbating...
to pictures of her mother.

906
00:59:14,959 --> 00:59:16,801
Can we get past
these cute deflections?

907
00:59:18,606 --> 00:59:21,073
Successes only last
until someone screws them up.

908
00:59:21,198 --> 00:59:22,701
Failures are forever.

909
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:24,526
So you accept that fact.

910
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:27,852
You accept that
there's nothing you can do.

911
00:59:28,168 --> 00:59:30,550
Okay, I accept the fact
that there's nothing I can do.

912
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:32,415
Now, what can I do?

913
00:59:32,696 --> 00:59:34,679
You acknowledge failure,

914
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,771
and you move past it.

915
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:38,474
You apologize.

916
00:59:40,936 --> 00:59:43,036
Powerful things these apologies.

917
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:46,237
Get someone to jump off a building.

918
00:59:46,362 --> 00:59:48,533
You say two words,
and you move on with your life.

919
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,530
Hardly seems fair.

920
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:52,537
Is that the issue?

921
00:59:55,861 --> 00:59:57,679
You caused him pain.

922
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,546
If the world is just,

923
01:00:01,988 --> 01:00:03,923
you have to suffer equally?

924
01:00:08,054 --> 01:00:09,654
You're not god, House.

925
01:00:10,164 --> 01:00:11,658
You're just another...

926
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:14,517
screwed-up human being
who needs to move on.

927
01:00:16,744 --> 01:00:18,271
Apologize to him.

928
01:00:18,778 --> 01:00:20,528
Let yourself feel better.

929
01:00:20,988 --> 01:00:23,388
Then you can learn
to let yourself...

930
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:26,396
keep feeling better.

931
01:01:06,977 --> 01:01:09,030
Dr. House, everything okay?

932
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:14,410
Time for group.

933
01:01:14,927 --> 01:01:16,527
Group time, everybody!

934
01:01:20,935 --> 01:01:22,460
I have a surprise.

935
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:23,797
2 weeks from today,

936
01:01:23,922 --> 01:01:26,722
we're going to have
the mayfield talent show.

937
01:01:27,336 --> 01:01:29,550
Talent show?
Who's in it?

938
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:32,178
I'd really love it if everybody here
could participate.

939
01:01:32,728 --> 01:01:35,723
- Then who's gonna watch?
- The staff will come,

940
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:37,016
friends and family.

941
01:01:37,687 --> 01:01:40,019
- You gonna tape this?
- No, it's just for us.

942
01:01:40,387 --> 01:01:42,438
If it's just for us,
I vote we don't do it.

943
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:45,434
Think of it as a fun way
to work on...

944
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:47,610
on our therapeutic issues.

945
01:01:47,952 --> 01:01:49,946
Avie, maybe you could sing
one of your songs.

946
01:01:50,554 --> 01:01:52,282
I don't sing. I rap.

947
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,284
You can write something just for us.

948
01:01:54,554 --> 01:01:57,662
I don't write.
I just do, freestyle style.

949
01:01:57,841 --> 01:01:59,704
I think you're gonna want
to be prepared.

950
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:02,529
- Make something special.</i>
- Always special.

951
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:05,253
How about you, Diane?
Is there something you'd like to do?

952
01:02:06,729 --> 01:02:08,131
I don't have any talents.

953
01:02:08,469 --> 01:02:11,217
Sure you do.
You all do.

954
01:02:11,966 --> 01:02:14,169
Steve, don't you think that Diane
has hidden talent

955
01:02:14,294 --> 01:02:15,805
that we'd like to see come out?

956
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,101
You really think he's gonna answer?

957
01:02:20,287 --> 01:02:22,061
- Eventually.
- Why?

958
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:25,189
Because things pass.

959
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:28,187
Things change.
It doesn't mean they get better.

960
01:02:28,491 --> 01:02:30,774
You got to make things better.
You can't just keep talking

961
01:02:30,899 --> 01:02:32,113
and hope for the best.

962
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:38,244
Diane, maybe you and I can work together
and figure something out.

963
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:41,186
I can save him.

964
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:45,293
"They stole her voice box",
that's what he said.

965
01:02:45,654 --> 01:02:47,420
That's what she was staring at.

966
01:02:48,019 --> 01:02:50,298
- That's why he's staring.
- Dr. House, please.

967
01:02:50,912 --> 01:02:53,134
- 'Cause there's a music box in there.
- Orderly.

968
01:02:55,932 --> 01:02:57,513
Just give it to me.
I can...

969
01:02:57,692 --> 01:03:00,602
I am not having a psychotic break.

970
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,935
I promise you this will work.

971
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:14,155
It's the blue box there
on the top shelf.

972
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,188
This is what you wanted.

973
01:03:19,313 --> 01:03:21,884
This is what you needed...
a voice.

974
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:24,896
You thought you could cure
silent girl with this.

975
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:27,293
So by your own rationale,
it should cure you.

976
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,510
There's nothing wrong with you.

977
01:03:32,181 --> 01:03:34,130
You're healing.
All the parts work.

978
01:03:34,255 --> 01:03:35,176
Just speak.

979
01:03:36,818 --> 01:03:38,679
Come on, speak!
Say something!

980
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:41,182
I think maybe everyone
should take a break now.

981
01:03:50,061 --> 01:03:51,317
You're trying to fix

982
01:03:52,174 --> 01:03:53,585
instead of moving on.

983
01:04:11,867 --> 01:04:13,317
I brought dvorak...

984
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:14,968
four hands.

985
01:04:18,283 --> 01:04:19,283
What?

986
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,260
I need to know what this is.

987
01:04:23,998 --> 01:04:25,348
It's sheet music.

988
01:04:30,089 --> 01:04:31,839
I told you.
It's just...

989
01:04:32,757 --> 01:04:34,357
two people having fun.

990
01:04:36,027 --> 01:04:37,787
There's two possible outcomes.

991
01:04:37,912 --> 01:04:39,636
It ends.
Someone gets hurt.

992
01:04:39,761 --> 01:04:42,161
Or it doesn't end.
Someone gets hurt.

993
01:04:42,927 --> 01:04:44,639
So the end sucks.

994
01:04:44,764 --> 01:04:46,675
It doesn't mean
the beginning has to.

995
01:04:48,089 --> 01:04:49,989
Everything ends.
Life ends.

996
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:53,099
It doesn't mean
that we can't enjoy it.

997
01:04:54,301 --> 01:04:56,201
I can't...
I can't do this.

998
01:04:58,414 --> 01:05:01,164
All I know is,
I was happy five minutes ago,

999
01:05:01,418 --> 01:05:02,718
and now I'm not.

1000
01:05:03,809 --> 01:05:05,209
How's that better?

1001
01:05:07,048 --> 01:05:08,348
Good-bye, Lydia.

1002
01:05:16,277 --> 01:05:18,377
I'm really worried about e. c. t.

1003
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:20,406
Apprehension's normal.

1004
01:05:20,752 --> 01:05:23,284
- Has anyone else had it?
- They shocked me, man.

1005
01:05:25,406 --> 01:05:27,497
Thanks.
That's very reassuring.

1006
01:05:28,496 --> 01:05:31,918
- I don't know if I should do it.
- Just do the treatment or shut up.

1007
01:05:32,623 --> 01:05:35,247
- Greg, there's a process.
- Yes, a process.

1008
01:05:35,372 --> 01:05:37,771
Wouldn't want to disrupt
the process with results.

1009
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:39,545
Heezy had a rough night last night.

1010
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:42,476
Guess he decided to go back to being
an ass instead of a hypocrite.

1011
01:05:42,601 --> 01:05:44,096
Let's move on.

1012
01:05:44,418 --> 01:05:47,287
Alvie, are you making
any progress writing your rap?

1013
01:05:48,684 --> 01:05:51,771
But really, no. I just don't want
to write my songs down.

1014
01:05:51,896 --> 01:05:54,504
It takes all the spontaneity
out of it. It's not...

1015
01:05:54,629 --> 01:05:55,858
of the moment.

1016
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:57,648
If you write things down...

1017
01:05:57,773 --> 01:05:59,362
When the time comes, my rhyme comes,

1018
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:01,542
when my spotlight shines...

1019
01:06:03,129 --> 01:06:04,729
Yeah, you're a genius.

1020
01:06:05,147 --> 01:06:06,619
Rhymes with "penius."

1021
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:08,937
Sorry to interrupt, dr. Beasley.

1022
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:11,290
Dr. Nolan asked me to give you this.

1023
01:06:16,127 --> 01:06:18,919
- Is this a day pass?
- He'd like to see you.

1024
01:06:38,945 --> 01:06:40,345
Thanks for coming.

1025
01:06:40,819 --> 01:06:43,447
I was hoping you could,
take a look at my dad's chart.

1026
01:06:44,988 --> 01:06:46,248
A consult?

1027
01:06:46,813 --> 01:06:50,121
What happened? You went through
every sane doctor in town?

1028
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:52,373
I thought you wouldn't mind
getting off the ward.

1029
01:06:56,775 --> 01:06:58,796
Cleaning lady found him
on the kitchen floor.

1030
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:01,774
Doctors here don't think
that he'll recover,

1031
01:07:01,899 --> 01:07:03,426
that I should pull the plug.

1032
01:07:03,939 --> 01:07:05,962
I want a second opinion, so I...

1033
01:07:06,087 --> 01:07:08,369
I thought I'd be a fool
not to call you.

1034
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:12,852
Lacunar infarct,

1035
01:07:13,448 --> 01:07:15,548
converted to hemorrhagic stroke.

1036
01:07:16,274 --> 01:07:17,874
It squashed his brain.

1037
01:07:18,685 --> 01:07:19,942
They didn't miss anything.

1038
01:07:21,739 --> 01:07:24,075
- That's what I thought.
- That's what you knew.

1039
01:07:25,981 --> 01:07:28,381
His brain
has been replaced by blood.

1040
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:29,660
It's over.

1041
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:33,497
And that's obvious to any doctor
who looks at that scan, even a shrink.

1042
01:07:34,529 --> 01:07:37,001
You want someone to tell you
that what you need to do is OK,

1043
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,379
to give you permission, absolution.

1044
01:07:39,938 --> 01:07:41,130
Not now, House.

1045
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:44,717
You have no friends, no family.

1046
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:47,053
At some point,

1047
01:07:47,342 --> 01:07:49,704
you made a mistake.
You lost everything.

1048
01:07:51,622 --> 01:07:53,809
And now I'm the closest thing
you got to a friend.

1049
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:55,885
Just shut up.

1050
01:07:58,072 --> 01:07:59,772
I don't need you here...

1051
01:08:00,162 --> 01:08:01,562
to play this game.

1052
01:08:53,564 --> 01:08:55,516
I'm sorry I pushed you away.

1053
01:08:56,962 --> 01:08:58,499
It's what I do when I'm afraid.

1054
01:09:00,934 --> 01:09:03,754
Again, german-english
translation may be a little off.

1055
01:09:07,192 --> 01:09:09,792
I'm not... I'm not crying
because of you.

1056
01:09:12,724 --> 01:09:14,874
I'm crying because I'm pathetic.

1057
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:17,697
I brought her cello,

1058
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:20,779
in case she magically wakes up
for the show.

1059
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:23,858
Then I take the apology back.

1060
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,511
We're all pathetic.

1061
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:29,530
It's makes everything interesting.

1062
01:09:30,244 --> 01:09:32,414
I'm sick of life being interesting.

1063
01:13:22,174 --> 01:13:23,648
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1064
01:13:23,925 --> 01:13:25,983
<i>the one, the only,</i>

1065
01:13:26,427 --> 01:13:28,027
<i>Juan Alvarez!</i>

1066
01:13:35,029 --> 01:13:38,003
What's up? Ward six
is jumping off, y'all!

1067
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,665
Give it up for DJ Richter
on the ones and twos.

1068
01:13:40,841 --> 01:13:42,441
DJ Richter, spin that!

1069
01:13:48,568 --> 01:13:51,133
<i>Welcome to Mayfield
where the day feels long</i>

1070
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:54,011
<i>we act strong, but there's
got to be something wrong</i>

1071
01:13:54,258 --> 01:13:56,900
<i>see, we got hidden talents
you don't see hidden secrets</i>

1072
01:13:57,025 --> 01:13:58,307
<i>if we could show you those</i>

1073
01:14:05,002 --> 01:14:06,802
<i>If we could show you those</i>

1074
01:14:13,922 --> 01:14:16,022
<i>Then we wouldn't have no regrets</i>

1075
01:14:21,242 --> 01:14:23,749
<i>Wanna know my secrets?
Sit back and let me explain it</i>

1076
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:25,459
<i>My pops split, mama got sick</i>

1077
01:14:25,635 --> 01:14:26,684
<i>Clich, ain't it?</i>

1078
01:14:26,809 --> 01:14:29,296
<i>Now I'm a manic hispanic
I'm trying to make it work</i>

1079
01:14:29,473 --> 01:14:31,189
<i>But the doctors think I'm lazy</i>

1080
01:14:38,582 --> 01:14:40,132
<i>My roommate is a jerk</i>

1081
01:14:42,837 --> 01:14:44,770
<i>Dr. House is in the house, y'all</i>

1082
01:14:44,946 --> 01:14:47,815
<i>Give it up for Dr. House
to the stage, y'all</i>

1083
01:14:47,991 --> 01:14:49,658
<i>Paging Dr. House to the stage,</i>

1084
01:14:49,826 --> 01:14:50,626
<i>y'all</i>

1085
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,287
<i>Are you there, Dr. House?
It's on</i>

1086
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:55,052
<i>Bring it on</i>

1087
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:59,087
<i>He's coming to the stage, y'all</i>

1088
01:15:00,272 --> 01:15:02,788
<i>It's Dr. House on the remix</i>

1089
01:15:02,964 --> 01:15:04,623
<i>Dr. House on the remix</i>

1090
01:15:07,607 --> 01:15:10,504
<i>They say to take your pills
They say don't be a creep</i>

1091
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,112
<i>But how can I get better</i>

1092
01:15:14,222 --> 01:15:15,593
<i>If I can't get no sleep?</i>

1093
01:15:16,662 --> 01:15:19,730
<i>You gotta think before you act
In order to progress</i>

1094
01:15:22,592 --> 01:15:25,478
<i>If you don't make connections
Then your whole life is a mess</i>

1095
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:30,977
<i>Yeah, so tell me, doctor,
what I really got to know</i>

1096
01:15:31,102 --> 01:15:32,582
<i>How do I get better?</i>

1097
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:34,987
<i>Just do a talent show</i>

1098
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,002
<i>Well, I guess I'm just a mess, yes</i>

1099
01:15:39,127 --> 01:15:41,285
<i>Preach it to me, brother
A life of restlessness</i>

1100
01:15:41,461 --> 01:15:42,995
<i>But at least we have each other</i>

1101
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:45,456
<i>We got each other, we got each other</i>

1102
01:15:45,632 --> 01:15:49,602
<i>Like two brothers from another mother
Duck and run for cover, ward six</i>

1103
01:15:59,237 --> 01:16:00,537
How are you doing?

1104
01:16:01,202 --> 01:16:02,398
You hanging in there?

1105
01:16:03,117 --> 01:16:04,566
Usually, I open with that.

1106
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:08,887
Thanks for staying.

1107
01:16:11,837 --> 01:16:12,837
So...

1108
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:14,902
What do you want to talk about?

1109
01:16:16,122 --> 01:16:17,722
Things are actually...

1110
01:16:19,502 --> 01:16:20,562
Actually good.

1111
01:16:21,312 --> 01:16:24,912
You don't want to complain
in front of the guy who lost his father?

1112
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:27,464
I'm not that cured.

1113
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,267
I still got stuff to do, but...

1114
01:16:33,627 --> 01:16:34,627
I'm good.

1115
01:16:43,082 --> 01:16:44,082
I'm sorry.

1116
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:01,542
I was trying to prove a point.

1117
01:17:04,272 --> 01:17:05,703
I was trying to be right.

1118
01:17:07,107 --> 01:17:10,207
I ended up putting you
in a dangerous situation,

1119
01:17:10,662 --> 01:17:12,472
and I was not equipped to handle it.

1120
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,962
You got hurt, and...

1121
01:17:15,412 --> 01:17:16,612
it's my fault.

1122
01:17:19,732 --> 01:17:20,932
And I'm sorry.

1123
01:17:30,652 --> 01:17:31,752
Med time.

1124
01:17:37,432 --> 01:17:39,445
I'll try those pink ones today.
You?

1125
01:18:34,853 --> 01:18:35,668
Thank you.

1126
01:18:36,822 --> 01:18:37,982
You're welcome.

1127
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:48,792
Got a surprise.

1128
01:20:02,082 --> 01:20:04,840
Today, we're here to congratulate.

1129
01:20:05,242 --> 01:20:06,242
Annie!

1130
01:20:09,032 --> 01:20:10,262
We're proud of her!

1131
01:20:10,438 --> 01:20:12,206
We wish her well, and we hope to...

1132
01:20:12,331 --> 01:20:14,558
Never see her again!

1133
01:20:27,942 --> 01:20:30,127
If you go silent for over a decade,

1134
01:20:30,252 --> 01:20:33,160
you don't just get to slide
right back into society.

1135
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:39,333
She's going to a rehab facility first,
in Arizona.

1136
01:20:42,722 --> 01:20:44,254
Her family's moving there.

1137
01:20:47,202 --> 01:20:48,133
Sorry, House.

1138
01:20:49,347 --> 01:20:50,787
I just found out myself.

1139
01:20:55,742 --> 01:20:57,768
I want an overnight pass.

1140
01:21:03,497 --> 01:21:05,242
- I can help you.
- I've earned it.

1141
01:21:05,562 --> 01:21:07,302
- Yes, but...
- Isn't extending trust

1142
01:21:07,427 --> 01:21:09,404
part of the whole
"getting me better" thing?

1143
01:21:09,581 --> 01:21:12,574
If you insist on a pass, I'll give it
to you. But I know where you're going,

1144
01:21:12,872 --> 01:21:15,242
and I know you haven't
thought it through.

1145
01:21:16,532 --> 01:21:18,630
We need to sit down,
talk about this.

1146
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:22,752
Please, give me the pass.

1147
01:21:50,622 --> 01:21:51,422
Hi.

1148
01:21:51,572 --> 01:21:52,364
Hello.

1149
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:53,498
Who are you?

1150
01:21:53,699 --> 01:21:54,491
I'm...

1151
01:21:56,947 --> 01:21:58,497
Ben, go inside, okay?

1152
01:22:04,892 --> 01:22:06,592
You didn't say anything.

1153
01:22:07,372 --> 01:22:11,072
And now Annie's leaving,
and I hear you're going to Arizona.

1154
01:22:13,067 --> 01:22:16,930
My husband travels to Phoenix a lot.
His corporate headquarters are there.

1155
01:22:17,857 --> 01:22:21,310
We've been wanting to move for years,
but we've been tethered here.

1156
01:22:22,112 --> 01:22:23,562
And now, we're not.

1157
01:22:26,097 --> 01:22:27,399
I don't want you to go.

1158
01:22:29,397 --> 01:22:30,847
I don't want to go.

1159
01:22:33,887 --> 01:22:36,557
But I can't break up my family.

1160
01:22:36,682 --> 01:22:38,482
I can't leave my children.

1161
01:22:40,857 --> 01:22:42,789
I just don't want it to change.

1162
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:49,972
I'm sorry
that I didn't come to say goodbye.

1163
01:22:52,892 --> 01:22:55,577
I thought it ended kind of perfect.

1164
01:23:03,772 --> 01:23:04,922
I have to go.

1165
01:23:24,282 --> 01:23:27,459
Not the most exciting use
of the overnight pass I've ever seen.

1166
01:23:28,402 --> 01:23:29,402
She left.

1167
01:23:31,317 --> 01:23:32,317
And...

1168
01:23:34,002 --> 01:23:35,002
I'm lost.

1169
01:23:48,432 --> 01:23:50,044
I'm gonna write your letter...

1170
01:23:51,312 --> 01:23:52,734
to the medical board,

1171
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:54,828
so that they give your license back.

1172
01:23:56,077 --> 01:23:57,672
You can't just console me

1173
01:23:57,797 --> 01:23:59,741
by giving me a lollipop
when I skin my knee.

1174
01:24:00,064 --> 01:24:01,251
Two things happened.

1175
01:24:01,582 --> 01:24:02,502
You got hurt,

1176
01:24:02,797 --> 01:24:06,039
that means you connected to someone else
strongly enough to miss them.

1177
01:24:06,322 --> 01:24:07,772
And more important,

1178
01:24:08,242 --> 01:24:10,377
you recognized the pain
and came to talk to me,

1179
01:24:10,967 --> 01:24:13,617
instead of hiding from it
in a Vicodin bottle.

1180
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:17,282
The fact that you're hurting
and you came here,

1181
01:24:17,697 --> 01:24:19,094
that you're taking your meds

1182
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,902
and we're talking right now...

1183
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:25,517
Come inside and get some sleep.

1184
01:24:26,302 --> 01:24:28,637
Tomorrow,
you can start saying your goodbyes.

1185
01:24:35,842 --> 01:24:38,618
Today,
we're here to congratulate Greg.

1186
01:24:40,232 --> 01:24:41,467
We're proud of him.

1187
01:24:41,592 --> 01:24:43,387
We wish him well, and we hope...

1188
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:46,172
To never see him again!

1189
01:24:47,152 --> 01:24:48,152
House!

1190
01:25:02,471 --> 01:25:03,263
Back off.

1191
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:04,983
People already think we're gay.

1192
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:26,577
What do you need, Alvie?

1193
01:26:26,702 --> 01:26:27,702
My meds.

1194
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,936
I want to get better.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
