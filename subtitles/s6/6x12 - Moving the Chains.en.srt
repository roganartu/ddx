It's not just burst.
He can pull too.

You know, the only reason
he went to a double "a" school,

He was a bit

69
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:39,327
E.R. Ct'd him--
no concussion, no stroke,

<i>No cortical degeneration.</i>

71
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:42,831

He's not crazy.

00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,367

Only proving that our guy
got his hands on the good stuff.

77
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:54,209
The negative test at least means
steroids is less likely.

78
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,510
We should discuss
other possibilities.

79
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:56,578

00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:08,823
Pituitary damage wouldn't be
visible on a ct scan.

87

Could cause the excess hormones
that could cause the rage

And would elude
the e.R. Steroid test.

89

Fine.

90
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:17,332

How do you know
about that?

102
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:48,029
Said he couldn't get you

<i>I get it.

Is that all?

106
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:57,772
You're officially unbusy.

108
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:02,444
Take the rest of the day.
Go see your brother.

109
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,013
I have work to do.

110
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:11,786
Do you feel any pain
that's deep and persistent,

111
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,388
Not just muscles
or joints?

112
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,290
Everything hurts all the time.
That's football.

113
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,158
It might not be
just football.

114
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:19,761
We're gonna test for damage
to your pituitary.

115
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:22,764
If there is,
it could create excess hormones,

116
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:23,998
Which could be causing
your pain.

117
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,400
It would also explain
your rage attack.

118
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:27,001
And if my pituitary
is damaged,

119
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,336
How long would it take
to treat?

120
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:29,604
I don't want to get
ahead of ourselves

121
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:31,139

00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:42,450
If we do find
something wrong,

127
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,453
We can go in through the nose
and repair the damage--

128
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,721
Nothing too invasive.

129
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:48,957
You'll need a couple days
of recovery,

130
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:51,059
And then we can have you back
by game time.

131
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,963
Thank you, doctor.

132
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,465
There's nothing wrong
with your eyes.

133
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:02,437
Well, then
your gizmo's broken.

134
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:03,771
I'm seeing spots.

135
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,007
Or you enlisted,

136
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,877
You got the cool haircut
and the awesome pants,

137
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:10,378
Then you realized
that your plane ticket

138
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:11,646
To the middle east
was coach,

139
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:13,615
And you decided to rethink
your promise.

140
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,884
No.

141
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,553
I've already been there--
three deployments.

142
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,055
Now they want me
to go again.

143
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:22,657
But my wife's pregnant.

144
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:24,759
So our homeland
should be unsafe

145
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:28,329
Because your private
was unsafe.

146
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:30,899
Look, my wife and I
planned this perfect.

147
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,901
My enlistment was supposed
to be over last week,

148
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:35,470
So we got pregnant
six months ago.

149
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:37,472
Now they tell me
I'm getting stop-lossed--

150
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,407
Army speak for they don't care
about the fact

151
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:40,975
That I've already finished
my contract.

152
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:43,411
I don't care about the fact
that they don't care.

153
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,513
Hey, come on.

154
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:48,049
I waited an extra hour
just to make sure I got you.

155
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,217
Why?

156
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:52,353
I saw you limping
out there.

157
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:53,855

158
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:56,191

<i>Well, back in my day,</i>

162
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,966
The real dodgers had the stones
to run up to canada

163
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,701
Or shoot themselves
in the foot.

164
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,102
<i>They didn't come
to free clinics</i>

165

<i>Whining

166
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:12,373
Go hug your wife.
Tell her to get a babysitter.

<i>You'll be back in time

The kid's first steps.

169
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:20,448
I don't need
to see the scan.

170
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:22,183

puppy-dog eyes

171

That his pituitary's fine.

172
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,221
Are you gonna say it,
or should I?

173
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:27,655
You were right
about the steroids.

174
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:28,990
You're a genius.

175
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,892
Next time with feeling.

176
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,560
Put the cheater
on a somatostatin analog

177
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:33,795
To clear it out
of his system.

178
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,663
Send him back
to his football game.

179
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,302
I've never done steroids.

180
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,038
Well, somehow your gnrh
got elevated.

181
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:45,607
This will help get it
back down.

182
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,975
Mom, I swear.

183
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:48,476
Who's gonna draft you,
daryl?

184
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:50,078
You're stupid enough
to try that stuff,

185
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,946
Especially the week
you know you're getting tested.

186
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,381
You guys must've mixed up
your labs

187
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,084
Or got somebody else's blood,
because I never--

188
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:57,385
[machine beeping rapidly]

189
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:59,187
Okay, what is that?

190
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:01,189
Tachycardia.
Lay back down, daryl.

191
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:03,558
[labored breathing]

192
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:04,926
Why's my heart beating
like this?

193
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:06,561
It's not steroids.

194
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,229
I need some adenosine!

195
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:09,731
And get that crash cart
over here!

196
00:08:09,798 --> 00:08:11,599
Oh.

197
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:14,802
House, next time--

198
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,606
Marcus.

199
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:21,309
Oh, right.
You two know each other.

200
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,112
What are you doing here?

201
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:26,314
Uh, interviewing.

202
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,583
Oh!
Who are we kidding?

203
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:31,886
Interview's over.
You got the job.

204
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:33,187
What job?

205
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:35,590
My new assistant.

206
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,325
Part of his parole--
he needs a job.

207
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:38,960
Just trying to do
my part.

208
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:41,829
You were wrong
about the steroids.

209
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,665
Patient had
a paroxysmal tachycardia.

210
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,700
<i>We cardioverted him
back to sinus rhythm.</i>

211
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,902
<i>We're gonna get an ekg
and a sestamibi scan.</i>

212
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,937
Marcus...

213
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,372
Let's talk outside.

214
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,810
Family is family.

215
00:08:55,878 --> 00:08:59,614
Hey.
Good to see you too.

216
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,484
Did you have
a hard stretch?

217
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:05,887
No, not bad.
I hardly got raped at all.

218
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:08,956
You can't work here.

219
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:10,091
Well, your boss says
I can.

220
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,359
I'm not playing.

221
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:12,660
Lighten up.

222
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:14,495
Man, this could be fun.

223
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,631
I get to see your world.

224
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:18,266
You get me access
to the pharmacy.

225
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:21,903
I am playing.
Come on, man.

226
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,105
You look good.

227
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:25,540
I'd already know that
if you came to visit

228
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,141
Every once in a while,
but whatever, I get it.

229
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,277
It--it's cool.
You don't want to see me.

230
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:31,479
You don't want
to pick me up.

231
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,815
It's all justified.

232
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:35,650
I'll just have to win you
back over.

233
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:38,886
Let me explain something.

234
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,621
This man who's offering
you the job--

235
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:41,956
He's not a philanthropist.

236
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:43,224
He seems more helpful
than you.

237
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,094
He doesn't want
to help you.

238
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:48,830
He only wants to use you
to screw with me.

239
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:51,699
You know how you can screw
with him?

240
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:54,469
Act like your brother getting
a job doesn't screw with you.

241
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:57,605
Trust me, it'll be better
for both of us

242
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:59,107
If you go back in there
and tell him

243
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:00,641
You can't take the job.

244
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,777
I'm not a person
who has the luxury

245
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:04,445
Of turning down jobs.

246
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:07,982
Well, figure something out...

247
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,251
'cause you cannot work here.

248
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:19,015
Mm.

249
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:19,983
Oh!

250
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,217
[possum hisses]

251
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:22,485
Ho-wah!

252
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:24,087
[possum hisses]

253
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:25,288
House!

254
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,389
[possum hisses]

255
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:29,092
Okay.
Oh! Oh!

256
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,628
(taub)
we spent all night,
used all the fancy machines.

257
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,463
Patient's heart
looks fine.

258
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:34,664
(house)
well, if it was fine,

259
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,199
<i>It wouldn't go aflutter</i>

260
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:37,667
<i>Just 'cause you walked
into the room.</i>

261
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:39,736
Light whip,
two extra shots.

262
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:41,404
Thank you, sir.

263
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:43,239
Judging by the look
on your face,

264
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:45,108
I assume you're upset

265
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,609
That big bro didn't take
your advice

266
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,111
And skip town.

267
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,779
You told him
about our conversation?

268
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:51,948
He bought me breakfast.

269
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:53,683
<i>(house)
it was fun.</i>

270
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,419
Put lunch in the books,
just you and me.

271
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:58,688
Our patient
could have a pfo.

272
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:02,325
Well, naturally, you jump
right to a urinary issue.

273
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:04,460
Pfo's not urinary.
It's a heart issue.

274
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:06,362
It is? Oh.

275
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,697
<i>Well, naturally,
you think</i>

276
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:08,998
It's not a urinary issue,

277
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,733
'cause you're so embarrassed
about your own

278
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,569
Past urinary issues,

279
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,137
You don't dare broach
the subject.

280
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:16,940
Oh, come on.

281
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,443
You spending the night
over at bobby samson's.

282
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,014
[sighs]

283
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:27,183
I did not wet the bed.

284
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,184
<i>I spilled a drink.</i>

285
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:29,786
We're not buying it, eric.

286
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:31,020
We never bought it.

287
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:32,422
Why aryou telling him
these things?

288
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,724
What's the big deal?
It was 25 years ago.

289
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:38,695
Oxygenated
and deoxygenated blood mix,

290
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:41,331
The rough flow causes a clot,
explains the heart and head.

291
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:43,433
<i>(marcus)
like that power forward
from loyola marymount,</i>

292
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,901
When he, um...

293
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,903
Hank gathers?
That's not what happened to him.

294
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:49,839
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let your brother speak.

295
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,174
What happened
to hank gathers?

296
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,376
<i>(marcus)
conference tournament--</i>

297
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,144
Alley-oop dunk,
jams it home.

298
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:56,646
Then he runs up the court
and splat.

299
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:57,947
<i>He dropped dead
of a heart thing</i>

300
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:59,048
<i>Right there on the court.</i>

301
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,383
I remember that.

302
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,151
On autopsy,
they found he had

303
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,453
<i>A hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.</i>

304
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,654
<i>(house)
rage and tachycardia</i>

305
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,089
Are warning signs.

306
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:07,523
Seriously?

307
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:09,792
Because my brother
remembers a basketball game?

308
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,128
Hey, I don't care
where an idea comes from,

309
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:14,764
As long as it makes sense
and embarrasses someone.

310
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,699
[door opens]

311
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,701
Are you out of your mind?

312
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,837
As a former
psychiatric patient,

313
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:22,538
I take offense
at that terminology.

314
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:24,874
All I did was ban you
from my tub.

315
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:26,676
Whatever happened
to proportional response?

316
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,645
Whatever happened
to coherent conversation?

317
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:31,180
That...Thing...

318
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,882
Broke tiles,
gashed the walls,

319
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,317
And pooped everywhere.

320
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,752
<i>Expect a bill for repairs...</i>

321
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:39,155
And payback.

322
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,860
What was that?

323
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:45,428
I have no idea.

324
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,196
<i>Everybody else thinks</i>

325
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:49,132
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
makes sense?

326
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,769
Good. Stick the patient
on a treadmill.

327
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,570
Stress his heart
until it stops.

328
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:57,106
You want to induce
cardiac arrest?

329
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:58,941
Only real treatment
is for the patient

330
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,343
Never to stress
his heart again,

331
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:02,245
Which means we have
to tell him to retire

332
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,646
At the ripe old age
of 21.

333
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,515
Stopping his heart
speaks louder than words.

334
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:06,816
<i>Go.</i>

335
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:12,822
Maybe it's a good thing.

336
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,057
He gave your brother a job,
responsibility.

337
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,161
I'm not arguing
that he shouldn't have a job.

338
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:20,062
I just don't want him
having one here.

339
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,831
I understand that house
did this to annoy you.

340
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,033
But why is he succeeding?

341
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,839
[sighs] you know
what my brother did

342
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:32,308
The last time
he got out of prison?

343
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:36,145
He stole money
from my parents to buy drugs.

344
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:37,380
He robbed a liquor store.

345
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:39,782
Then he moved on
to jacking luxury cars--

346
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,917
Last time.

347
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:42,852
<i>Every time.</i>

348
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,289
I've known my brother
for over 30 years.

349
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:48,724
You haven't even known
him a day.

350
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,328
I'm sorry.

351
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:57,200
The exterminator
charged $250

352
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:58,968
To get the opossum
out of there,

353
00:13:59,036 --> 00:14:00,736
And the contractor
estimates

354
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,306
$1,500 to fix the bathroom.

355
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:06,742
And why are you
jerking foreman around?

356
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,745
Because it's fun.

357
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:11,581
Maybe you should give
those bills to the guy

358
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:14,550
Who left his own
bathroom window open.

359
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:17,353
Your motives always run deeper
than simple fun.

360
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,721
<i>I want to learn more</i>

361
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:21,991
About one of my employees
so that I can manipulate him

362
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,527
And destroy him
if and when I choose.

363
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,128
Information is power.

364
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:28,064
<i>Not buying it.
Okay.</i>

365
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,700
Why don't you tell me
my real evil plan?

366
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,401
I don't think
there is an evil plan.

367
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:34,103
You regret not having
a relationship

368
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:35,671
With your own family,

369
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:38,307
And you don't want to see
foreman go down that same path.

370
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,009
I think...

371
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,411
You're actually
being nice.

372
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:44,247
Oh, shut up.

373
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,517
You can't accuse me
of an opossum attack

374
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:50,419
And underhanded kindness
in the same visit.

375
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:51,687
Then I'll come back.

376
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:52,989
[door opens]

377
00:14:53,056 --> 00:14:55,658
<i>(chase)
treadmill test was a bust.</i>

378
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:57,660
The guy's
in unbelievable shape.

379
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,896
We couldn't get his heart rate
above 150.

380
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:03,232
Your boss is secretly
a very nice man.

381
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:07,169
I know.

382
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:10,873
<i>If we can't re-create
the cardiac event,</i>

383
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:11,974
<i>We can't prove</i>

384
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,709
Hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

385
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:17,713
Either we find
a bigger treadmill...

386
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:20,816
Or...

387
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:28,524
Did I miss the memo
about you being released?

388
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:30,126
I'm feeling fine.

389
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:32,194
I can't keep laying here
in this bed missing practices.

390
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:34,764
All excellent points.
Give me your arm.

391
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:35,798
What's in the shot?

392
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,867
It's a vasodilator.

393
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:40,336
Since we can't exercise your
son's heart on the treadmill,

394
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:43,406
I'm gonna have to do it
chemically.

395
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:48,844
What's wrong?

396
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:50,580
You're turning white.

397
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:51,847
What does that mean?

398
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,583
It means
he doesn't need football

399
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,718
To get a good job anymore.

400
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:02,365
Raynaud's phenomenon--

401
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:03,633
Vasospasms cut off
the blood supply

402
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:05,401
To his fingers.

403
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:07,603
Could be early onset
rheumatoid arthritis.

404
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,171
Rheumatoid factor
is negative.

405
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,673
(thirteen)
arterial plaque
throwing clots

406
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:12,742
Would explain the fingers,
head, heart.

407
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,243
You really think a guy
with stenosis

408
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:16,912
Could've aced
that treadmill test?

409
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,783
You're kidding me.
You got him a desk?

410
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,387
And a nameplate.

411
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:26,555
Man's got to have a place
he can call his own.

412
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,624
<i>(chase)
what about
takayasu's arteritis?</i>

413
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:31,494
Lymphoma's a better fit.
We should remove his spleen.

414
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:33,462
Bold move to skip
straight to surgery.

415
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,864
<i>His big game's coming up.</i>

416
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:36,499
We don't have time
to biopsy,

417
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,367
Wait for the pathology report,
and resect.

418
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:39,635
<i>(chase)
right.</i>

419
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:41,604
We should remove his spleen
without confirmation

420
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:42,872
So he won't miss
the big game.

421
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:45,307
Hang an ethanol drip.

422
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,542
That won't treat

423
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,144
For either lymphoma
or takayasu's.

424
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:49,945
If it's lymphoma,
the ethanol will make him itchy,

425
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:51,547
And foreman can remove
his spleen.

426
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:53,883
If it's takayasu's,
he'll lose his radial pulse,

427
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,084
<i>And chase can start him
on steroids.</i>

428
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:01,957
Marcus!

429
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:12,935
What are you doing here?

430
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:15,638
My new assignment
is to shadow you

431
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:16,839
In enemy territory

432
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:18,941
And document your every word
to the patient.

433
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,578
Just don't say
anything stupid.

434
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:25,448
You're not an idiot.
Don't do this.

435
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:27,783
Come on, man.

436
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:30,453
I'm a new person now--
no more drugs, no more lying.

437
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,022
And if I can't get
my own family

438
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,523
To give me an opportunity
to prove that,

439
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:35,758
Then what's the point?

440
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:38,094
Mom and dad
gave you a chance

441
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:39,161
And a second

442
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:40,463
And a third.

443
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,164
I'm not about
to give you a 54th.

444
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,751
Why isn't your minion
fetching your lunch?

445
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,788
He's busy spying
on his little brother.

446
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,857
[chuckles]

447
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:09,558
What?

448
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:11,660
That's very demeaning.

449
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,430
You obviously have a theory

450
00:18:14,498 --> 00:18:16,265
As to why demeaning
is not demeaning.

451
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,600
You're escalating

452
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,535
To prove I was wrong
about you being nice,

453
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:22,238
Which you would only do
if I was right.

454
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:23,772
Do you even listen
to yourself?

455
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,641
23-year-old just came
into the e.R.,

456
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:26,909
Asked for you.

457
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:28,811
What's her cup size?

458
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:30,112
<i>I don't think
his cup size</i>

459
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,580
Is relevant
to his condition.

460
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:33,382
He accidentally shot himself
in the foot.

461
00:18:37,988 --> 00:18:40,189
Oh!

462
00:18:40,257 --> 00:18:42,224
Seriously?

463
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:43,993
I give you a choice
between moving to canada

464
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,227
And shooting yourself
in the foot,

465
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:46,428
And you chose the bullet?

466
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:48,397
I didn't want
to be a fugitive.

467
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:50,266
<i>You think this is gonna
get you discharged?</i>

468
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,634
We'll patch it up
and send you right back.

469
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,569
Don't patch it up.

470
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:57,773
Look...

471
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,275
You got screwed over
by your own government,

472
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:00,743
And that sucks.

473
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,144
<i>But all you're gonna get
out of this</i>

474
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:04,046
Is a five-day vacation
and a band-aid.

475
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:07,917
When I signed up,
I was just a guy.

476
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,818
Now I'm about to be a dad.

477
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:11,153
I go back over,

478
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:12,988
There's a chance my kid grows up
without a father.

479
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:19,228
You got a girl pregnant.

480
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,163
You're still just a guy.

481
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,741
How much longer
we have to wait?

482
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:33,809
We have to keep going

483
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:35,244
Until you start
feeling something.

484
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:36,545
Might help
if, uh, you told me

485
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:37,846
What I'm supposed
to feel.

486
00:19:37,914 --> 00:19:39,915
If I do that, that's all
you'll be thinking about.

487
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:41,817
Then you'll be telling me
that's what you're feeling--

488
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:43,419
<i>Power of suggestion.</i>

489
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,221
The other black dude
who was in here earlier,

490
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:46,288
He your brother?

491
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:47,856
What gave it away?

492
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:49,725
The way you looked at him.

493
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:50,993
I have two older brothers,

494
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:52,561
And we always want to kill
each other.

495
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,897
[chuckles]

496
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,200
Oh. Mm.

497
00:19:58,268 --> 00:20:01,036
Something wrong?

498
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:03,706
Not really.

499
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:06,642
It just feels itchy.

500
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,444
Is that
what you're waiting for?

501
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:11,513
Means lymphoma's most likely,
but that's actually good news.

502
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:12,881
How could that be good news?

503
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:14,216
Because it's treatable.

504
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:16,585
We can remove your spleen
tonight laparoscopically.

505
00:20:16,653 --> 00:20:18,354
Will I be able to run
by Saturday?

506
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:20,623
We can get to the radiation
in the off-season.

507
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,858
[chuckles]

508
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:24,960
Hey, ma.

509
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:27,329
<i>Wake up, ma.
Wake up.</i>

510
00:20:27,397 --> 00:20:29,465
I'm itchy.
Means I can play.

511
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:44,079
Ahh.

512
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:51,120
[humming]

513
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:54,657
âª âª

514
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:24,520
[sighs]

515
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:29,658
Oh.

516
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:31,627
[sighs] what are you doing
in the dark?

517
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:33,962
Lying in wait.

518
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,367
Jeez. What happened
to your face?

519
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:41,503
Right...
Play innocent.

520
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:43,138
Like you weren't looking
for revenge for the prank

521
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:44,540
That I didn't pull.

522
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,775
It's karmic justice,
but I didn't do it.

523
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:49,645
Of course you realize,
this means war.

524
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,722
Isolating
the gastroepiploic artery.

525
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:03,192
Nearly there.

526
00:22:05,295 --> 00:22:07,429
Foreman, come and take
a look at this.

527
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,967
Liver's inflamed.

528
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:16,638
So the itching wasn't caused
by his spleen.

529
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:18,540
It's not lymphoma.

530
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,077
What happened
to your face?

531
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,913
Wilson annexed
the sudetenland.

532
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:30,115
<i>(foreman)
no abnormal "t" cells
or "b" cells.</i>

533
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,417
It's definitely
not lymphoma.

534
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,952
<i>Liver biopsy only revealed</i>

535
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,587
<i>Nonspecific
inflammation.</i>

536
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,389
Kind of like the time
you took

537
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,024
Your mom's
birth control pills

538
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:40,326
<i>On a dare</i>

539
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,694
And ended up
with swollen nipples.

540
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:42,828
That never happened.

541
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:44,496
Right, and your nickname

542
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,965
All the way up through
high school wasn't erica.

543
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:47,900
It wasn't.

544
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:51,837
Okay, I may have made
that one up,

545
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,005
<i>With the understanding
that my brother</i>

546
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:54,039
<i>Still had a sense of humor</i>

547
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,574
And would figure out
to play along.

548
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:57,076
Polymyositis would explain

549
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,610
<i>The head, liver, heart,</i>

550
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,646
<i>Even the white fingers.
It would also be accompanied</i>

551
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,915
By a significant decrease
in muscle power.

552
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,016
Marcus!

553
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,318
<i>Chance to redeem yourself.</i>

554
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,220
Does our patient
look strong to you?

555
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:11,890
Sorry, eric.

556
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,026
<i>Big brother disagrees
with your diagnosis.</i>

557
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:15,561
Felty syndrome?

558
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,896
You said the liver was inflamed,
not the spleen.

559
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,432
Can you believe they let
this guy perform surgery?

560
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,234
What are you doing?
Requesting permission

561
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:23,736
To share my idea
without being belittled

562
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,037
In front
of your new assistant.

563
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:27,473
Permission denied.
Continue.

564
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,341
[sighs] our patient
has cartilage damage

565
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,542
In both ankles.

566
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,010
He gets lidocaine shots
before every game

567
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,312
To mask the pain.

568
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,048
Team doctor uses the same needle
twice by accident,

569
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:37,282
Viral hepatitis.

570
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,485
You think
he's an idiot,arcus?

571
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,553
I don't think
he's an idiot.
Okay.

572
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:44,022
Go test his blood.

573
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,659
Come on.
We have a lunch scheduled.

574
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,767
So you jerked me around.

575
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,603
Your allegiance lies
with your brother.

576
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,538
I get it. Admirable.

577
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,773
Here's the problem.

578
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,775
I hired you
to tell me the truth.

579
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,910
If you don't do that,
you no longer have a job.

580
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:07,312
I don't know what secret
you're looking to uncover,

581
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,014
But my brother
is a decent guy.

582
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:11,550
He was arrested
for grand theft auto.

583
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:12,985
You're gonna be
disappointed.

584
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,921
Try me.

585
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:18,090
He tell you
I was with him?

586
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:19,291
Was it your idea?

587
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,592
We did everything
together.

588
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,760
I don't know
whose idea it was.

589
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,729
I was 16.
He was only 14.

590
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,898
Little punk couldn't even see
over the steering wheel.

591
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,766
He's quicker
with a flathead screwdriver

592
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,234
Than most people
with a key.

593
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,703
[footsteps approaching]

594
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,341
Sorry to interrupt
my character assassination

595
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,910
With boring medical stuff,

596
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,344
But when we drew
the patient's blood,

597
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,146
It clotted right there
in the vacutainer.

598
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,382
So the problem
is not in his blood,

599
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,883
It's the blood itself.

600
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,352
He's been working out
in the cold doing two-a-days.

601
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,987
It's got to be
cryoglobulinemia.

602
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,123
I usually love breaking
bad news.

603
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,525
But in this case...

604
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:54,827
Start the patient
on warfarin.

605
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,465
<i>I'm so sorry about that.
You were saying...</i>

606
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,503
We drove for about ten minutes
before we got caught,

607
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:05,971
And that was it.

608
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,639
When our mom came down
to the station,

609
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,943
She didn't say a word
the whole ride home.

610
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,480
She came up to the driveway,
turned off the car.

611
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:16,248
We're sitting in there
in silence.

612
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:18,417
<i>Then without turning around,
she said,</i>

613
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:22,988
"I'll pray for you."

614
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:26,024
And she got
out of the car.

615
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:28,360
Wow.

616
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:29,661
You got off easy.

617
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,897
Easy for you,
easy for me,

618
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,399
Not easy for eric.

619
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,168
His life mission
became to never disappoint

620
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:37,636
Our mother like that again,

621
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,772
Because he is a good guy.

622
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,077
I thought he would tell
that story at the eulogy.

623
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,679
But I heard
he didn't give one.

624
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:48,780
Your--

625
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,719
Your mother's dead?

626
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:57,856
If he didn't tell you,
I'm sure he had a reason.

627
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:01,793
<i>Look, you can mock him
all you want</i>

628
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:02,828
About peeing in the bed,

629
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,763
But...

630
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,398
Please...

631
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:09,101
Don't bring up our mother.

632
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,674
Your blood contains
an abnormally high volume

633
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,976
Of certain proteins
called cryoglobulins.

634
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:20,712
They become thick
when it gets cold outside.

635
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,414
It's like a car
trying to run

636
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:24,149
After the oil's turned
to sludge.

637
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:26,351
We think that's what's been
causing all your problems.

638
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,387
So I just need
a quick oil change

639
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:29,688
<i>And I'm good to go.</i>

640
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,890
This oil change
isn't so quick.

641
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,091
We have to put you
on blood thinners

642
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,093
And other medications.

643
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:36,562
The process will take
two to three weeks.

644
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:37,763
But after that,

645
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,998
You should be able to play
without a problem.

646
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:41,266
After that, it's not
gonna matter.

647
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:42,501
(glenda)
doctor, if daryl

648
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:43,869
Doesn't play in front
of the scouts

649
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,470
On Saturday,
he won't get drafted.

650
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:47,239
Can't you wait
until after the game?

651
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:49,841
If we wait
and let him play,

652
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,376
There's a good chance
he dies

653
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,445
<i>Right on the field.</i>

654
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,593
I had an epiphany.

655
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,063
Usually that precedes you
walking away with purpose, so...

656
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,432
Flathead screwdriver.

657
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,734
And then I say...?

658
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:17,836
It's not a game.

659
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:20,272
It's proof that you didn't rig
the grab rail

660
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,440
And make me fall.

661
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:22,741
I already have proof
of that--

662
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,076
The fact
that I didn't do it.

663
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,944
I can't go on that.

664
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,546
<i>But I can go on the fact</i>

665
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:29,681
That I had to borrow
a flathead screwdriver from nora

666
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,950
<i>To install the thing, 'cause
we only had a phillips-head.</i>

667
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:33,785
And then, of course,
I returned it late that night

668
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,387
In a completely
successful effort

669
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:36,655
To see her braless...

670
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,457
Whoa. Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

671
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,726
Which means that you didn't
have the tool to sabotage

672
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,060
The grab rail.

673
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,795
<i>Braless under, like,
a sweater</i>

674
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,030
Or, like, a--like, a--

675
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,398
Now I also have proof

676
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:48,567
<i>That I'm not responsible
for the opossum,</i>

677
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:49,968
Because I'm absolving you

678
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,503
<i>Of responsibility
instead of escalating,</i>

679
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:53,839
Which you know
is not my nature.

680
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,208
So someone is breaking
into our place

681
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,676
Just to screw with us?

682
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,745
The opossum...

683
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:02,581
Was meant for me.

684
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:07,519
<i>(wilson)
I'm so tired.</i>

685
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:11,223
<i>It was exciting
till about 2:00 a.M.</i>

686
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,258
<i>Now it's just torture.</i>

687
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:15,794
<i>(house)
did you even go to college?</i>

688
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,864
This is the escalation,
isn't it?

689
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,466
Keeping me up all night,
nothing happens,

690
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,268
Then you keep me up all night
again tomorrow.

691
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:24,836
This is your retaliation.

692
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:27,072
You see,
that's just illogical,

693
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,940
'cause I'm staying up too.

694
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,309
Maybe you napped all day.

695
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,845
I gave you empirical proof
that I did not prank you.

696
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,313
No.
No, you did not.

697
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:39,017
You created empirical proof
that I didn't prank you,

698
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:42,120
Selling me on the notion
that you didn't prank me.

699
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:44,289
Maybe you self-pranked.

700
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:46,258
I don't master-prank.

701
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,827
Is that cut on your cheek
even real?

702
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:52,097
See, this is exactly
what our nemesis wants--

703
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:53,565
Divide and conquer.

704
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,001
Can't you see that?
Okay.

705
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:58,670
I'm going to bed.

706
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,372
<i>(house)
I'm telling you,
if you sleep now,</i>

707
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,874
<i>You're gonna wake up
next to severed horse heads.</i>

708
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,142
Or worse,
the rest of it.

709
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,746
[fire alarm beeps,
sprinklers turn on]

710
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,147
<i>(wilson)
oh!</i>

711
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,250
House!

712
00:29:15,655 --> 00:29:16,755
The flat screen!

713
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,030
<i>Ah. Ah.</i>

714
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:34,272
You would never sacrifice
the flat screen.

715
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:38,343
Oh, this guy is good.

716
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,720
[sighs]
is there a reason for this?

717
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:47,988
[ball bouncing]

718
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:50,192
<i>(house)
[french accent]
there is a reason</i>

719
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,429
<i>For everything,
mes amis.</i>

720
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:57,233
<i>I am troubled to report
that we have</i>

721
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,168
A criminal
in our midst.

722
00:29:59,236 --> 00:30:02,238
Guilty of what
exactly?

723
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:04,840
Last night, the fire sprinklers
flooded our apartment.

724
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:06,776
And before that,

725
00:30:06,843 --> 00:30:09,345
I found an opossum
in my bathtub.

726
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:10,346
You each had motive.

727
00:30:10,414 --> 00:30:13,516
You each had opportunity.

728
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,317
This is the emergency
you paged me about?

729
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:17,386
[clears throat]

730
00:30:17,454 --> 00:30:18,921
Not so fast,

731
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:20,389
Mademoiselle cuddy.

732
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:21,924
<i>No one leaves here</i>

733
00:30:21,992 --> 00:30:23,726
Until they can account
for their whereabouts

734
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:24,960
<i>The evening last.</i>

735
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:26,295
Bye.

736
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:29,331
[normal voice]
okay, no one

737
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,200
Who is employed by me
leaves here

738
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:33,436
Until they account for their
whereabouts the evening last.

739
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:36,238
What about you,
professor chase?

740
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:37,273
Why would I?

741
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,308
Because
you hold me responsible

742
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:41,076
For breaking up
your marriage.

743
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:42,545
I was here all night
with thirteen,

744
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:45,481
Monitoring our patient's
I.V. Blood thinners.

745
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:47,716
Can either of you
prove that?

746
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:49,485
The patient's alive
and improving.

747
00:30:49,553 --> 00:30:51,020
Is that proof enough?

748
00:30:51,087 --> 00:30:55,791
For now. What about you,
colonel taub?

749
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:57,092
I was out to dinner
with my wife.

750
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,360
<i>Really?</i>

751
00:30:58,428 --> 00:30:59,728
Your wife.

752
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,530
Yes, really.

753
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:04,133
Good enough.

754
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:06,068
'cause I had you pegged
all along.

755
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,305
You certainly had all the motive
in the world.

756
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:10,272
First of all,

757
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,674
I'm not interested.

758
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:14,477
Second, I don't even know
where you guys live.

759
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:17,279
Yesterday I confirmed
that you are a liar.

760
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:18,714
What are you
talking about?

761
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:20,349
<i>Well, at least a liar</i>

762
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:21,750
By omission.

763
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:22,685
House!

764
00:31:24,955 --> 00:31:26,422
Don't.

765
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,524
Get this, class.

766
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:30,960
Foreman's mom died.

767
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:35,698
<i>He ever tell any of you?</i>

768
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:36,799
<i>(wilson)
house,</i>

769
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:39,101
I think you're getting
off topic here.

770
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:40,369
<i>(thirteen)
is he serious?</i>

771
00:31:40,437 --> 00:31:41,837
Did your mom pass away?

772
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:45,307
About three months ago.

773
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,809
I'm so sorry.

774
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:48,210
Why didn't you tell
anybody?

775
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:49,979
<i>(house)
and to top it off,</i>

776
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:52,448
You refused to say anything nice
about her at the funeral.

777
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:54,783
I didn't talk because it isn't
anyone's business.

778
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:57,253
Stop.

779
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,455
You don't have to explain
yourself to this guy.

780
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:00,789
You want to hit me,
don't you?

781
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:02,191
Marcus, don't.

782
00:32:06,897 --> 00:32:08,264
I quit.

783
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:15,037
You should stop him.
He needs this job.

784
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:18,774
Our patient needs
a fresh I.V.

785
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:30,219
I don't need
two or three weeks.

786
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:32,955
See?
Got my color back.

787
00:32:33,023 --> 00:32:34,490
That means
you're getting better.

788
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:36,859
But it doesn't mean--
it means I am better.

789
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:38,394
My coach had
the team doctor come by.

790
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:39,862
He cleared me to play.

791
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,197
Did your team doctor realize
you're on blood thinners?

792
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:46,969
I'm off them now.

793
00:32:47,037 --> 00:32:48,137
You're still sick.

794
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:49,538
You're not ready to go off
your meds.

795
00:32:49,606 --> 00:32:52,308
Daryl, listen to him.
It is not worth the risk.

796
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,676
I'll come back
on Sunday, mom.

797
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:55,878
You guys can give me
all the meds I need then.

798
00:32:55,946 --> 00:32:58,280
The treatment doesn't work
that way.

799
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:05,988
Please go with him.

800
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:15,230
[grunts,
exhales sharply]

801
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:16,932
Antibiotics
aren't working.

802
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,369
<i>We're gonna switch you
to different ones,</i>

803
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:23,138
But you're gonna lose
your toe.

804
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:25,774
[laughing]

805
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:30,379
Outstanding, soldier.

806
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:31,814
<i>(house)
as a geveral rule,</i>

807
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:34,416
Before you celebrate,
do a little research.

808
00:33:34,484 --> 00:33:35,985
<i>The army's medical
evaluation board</i>

809
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:38,420
Is perfectly fine

810
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:40,289
<i>With nine-toed infantrymen,</i>

811
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:42,324
As long as they can walk
and run.

812
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:44,293
So I lost a toe
for nothing?

813
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:46,061
Afraid so.

814
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:48,397
<i>Unless you want me to keep you
on the old antibiotics,</i>

815
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:50,466
Let the infection spread,

816
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:52,701
And we could amputate
more than just a toe.

817
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:01,410
Why are you risking
your life for this?

818
00:34:01,478 --> 00:34:04,179
Your mom
doesn't want you to.

819
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:07,016
My mom sacrificed
everything for me.

820
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,250
Her telling me
not to come here

821
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:10,119
Is just another example
of that.

822
00:34:10,186 --> 00:34:12,621
I do good out there,
I could take care of her

823
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:14,590
For the rest of her life.

824
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:20,396
Who am I if I don't
sacrifice for her?

825
00:34:20,463 --> 00:34:22,765
That's family.

826
00:34:31,841 --> 00:34:34,677
[distant whistle blowing]

827
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:46,789
You okay?

828
00:34:46,856 --> 00:34:48,891
Everything's blurry.

829
00:34:53,863 --> 00:34:55,698
I can't see.

830
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,071
Take me back
to the hospital.

831
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,431
The blindness means
we were wrong about his--

832
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:13,000
<i>(foreman)
actually, I'm responsible
for that.</i>

833
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:15,935
<i>Spiked his water bottle
with nitrates,</i>

834
00:35:16,003 --> 00:35:17,137
Dropped his blood pressure,

835
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:18,471
Robbed oxygen-rich blood
from his brain,

836
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:19,839
Making him blind.

837
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:21,374
Figured a temporarily
blind patient

838
00:35:21,442 --> 00:35:23,176
Is better
than a permanently dead one.

839
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:25,078
Vision was already coming back
by the time I dropped him off

840
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:26,146
At the hospital.

841
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:29,182
Well played.

842
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,284
If only we could combine
your medical chicanery

843
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:33,586
With your brother's ability
to fetch me mochas,

844
00:35:33,654 --> 00:35:35,054
You'd be
the perfect foreman.

845
00:35:35,122 --> 00:35:36,089
Where are you?

846
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:38,324
I'm busy.

847
00:35:40,394 --> 00:35:42,095
(taub)
great. So we don't have
a new symptom.

848
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:44,430
Means we should just stick him
back on his blood thinners,

849
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:46,132
And he should be okay to leave
in a couple weeks.

850
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,067
Actually, we do have
a new symptom.

851
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:52,205
Any of you take a look
at his readmittance chart?

852
00:35:52,273 --> 00:35:54,674
Between the time he checked in
and the time he rechecked in,

853
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:57,410
<i>Our patient lost
a single pound.</i>

854
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:59,779
Patient like that would
usually shed over ten pounds.

855
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:02,282
<i>(taub)
the obvious answer</i>

856
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:03,817
Would be steroids,

857
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:05,752
But since we've already
ruled them out...

858
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,987
(chase)
so he's not injecting.

859
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:09,823
But he could be getting them
naturally--

860
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,624
Paraneoplastic syndrome.

861
00:36:11,692 --> 00:36:13,092
The body
produces antibodies,

862
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,694
<i>Which battle cancer,</i>

863
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:16,362
<i>Which could also act
like growth hormone.</i>

864
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,131
We've eliminated lymphoma.

865
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:21,267
What other cancers mimic
growth hormone?

866
00:36:21,335 --> 00:36:22,735
Lung, pancreatic,
renal, breast--

867
00:36:22,803 --> 00:36:25,004
It was a rhetorical question.
I don't really care.

868
00:36:25,072 --> 00:36:26,573
Go test him for all of them.

869
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,743
[knock at door]

870
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:37,083
[door opens]

871
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:40,386
What are you
doing here?

872
00:36:40,454 --> 00:36:42,155
You need a job.

873
00:36:44,692 --> 00:36:46,960
Maybe I can talk
to house,

874
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:48,795
See if I can get
your job back.

875
00:36:50,664 --> 00:36:53,867
Soon as he knows you're okay
with me being there,

876
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,602
He won't want me back.

877
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:59,172
Maybe I can help you
figure out something else.

878
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,442
I promise...

879
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:03,776
I won't let you down.

880
00:37:03,844 --> 00:37:08,047
Don't do that.

881
00:37:08,115 --> 00:37:10,316
Let's just...

882
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:11,784
See how it goes.

883
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:16,322
<i>So, uh,
do they mandate you</i>

884
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,991
To stay here
at the halfway house?

885
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:24,364
Or can you come stay
with family?

886
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:38,845
It's foreman.

887
00:37:38,913 --> 00:37:40,713
Well, it should stop
now that marcus left.

888
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:43,216
That's the whole point.

889
00:37:43,284 --> 00:37:45,618
[people gasp]

890
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:49,255
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was my leg sticking out?

891
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:51,858
I'm so distracted lately,
trying to think

892
00:37:51,926 --> 00:37:53,793
Of something funnier
than fire sprinklers

893
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:56,062
Going off in the middle
of the night.

894
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,363
Any ideas?

895
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:01,234
Whoa, easy there, tiger.

896
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:02,435
I know where you live.

897
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:03,770
You know how I know?

898
00:38:03,837 --> 00:38:05,238
'cause my girlfriend and I--

899
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:06,940
We tried to buy
that very same condo.

900
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:08,942
Why don't you leave me
out of this?

901
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:10,410
Wilson was the one
who bought the place.

902
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:11,544
And you're living there.

903
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:14,480
You...

904
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,049
Deserve to suffer
equally.

905
00:38:16,116 --> 00:38:18,651
Actually, I suffered more
now that you just tripped me.

906
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,320
Hey, hey, I-I-I'm--

907
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:21,754
His suffering
will equal out,

908
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:23,189
'cause he actually
feels remorse.

909
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:25,191
Why would you out
yourself?

910
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,126
You can't even imagine
the retribution.

911
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:29,796
Oh, there won't be any.

912
00:38:29,863 --> 00:38:32,031
<i>I am ceasing
all offensive operations.</i>

913
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,335
I have both made my point
and established my superiority.

914
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:37,337
<i>And if you even get
to the planning stages</i>

915
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:38,738
<i>Of retaliation,</i>

916
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:40,073
I will tell cuddy
that she lost her dream place

917
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,507
To you two.

918
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:44,077
<i>See, she's under
this odd impression</i>

919
00:38:44,144 --> 00:38:45,445
That you guys
are her friends.

920
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,631
There's no cancer.

921
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:06,933
<i>We scanned him
head to toe.</i>

922
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:08,634
<i>We checked blood smears
for leukemia.</i>

923
00:39:08,702 --> 00:39:10,937
We even ultrasounded his chest
looking for breast cancer.

924
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:13,106
Maybe I was wrong
about the weight loss.

925
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:14,273
<i>(taub)
you weren't wrong--
we found blood</i>

926
00:39:14,341 --> 00:39:15,341
In his catheter bag.

927
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:16,743
<i>His kidneys are failing.</i>

928
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,177
<i>(thirteen)
so it has to be cancer.</i>

929
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:20,046
Paraneoplastic syndrome
is the only thing

930
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:21,614
That can link kidney,

931
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:23,049
<i>Heart, and liver--
even the rage.</i>

932
00:39:23,117 --> 00:39:24,717
<i>(foreman)
why can't we find it?</i>

933
00:39:24,785 --> 00:39:26,552
We've looked everywhere
inside this guy.

934
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,857
What if it's not inside?

935
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:47,306
You know why you're black?

936
00:39:47,374 --> 00:39:49,809
'cause god loves me
more than he loves you?

937
00:39:49,877 --> 00:39:52,678
Hmm. What I was going for
was melanin.

938
00:39:52,746 --> 00:39:54,414
You got lots of it.

939
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:56,249
It makes your skin dark,

940
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:58,418
Protects you from the sun's
harmful u.V. Rays.

941
00:39:58,485 --> 00:39:59,619
What are you doing?

942
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:01,220
<i>Unfortunately,
it also prevents</i>

943
00:40:01,288 --> 00:40:03,056
Even those with advanced
medical degrees

944
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:06,092
From considering melanoma
as a diagnosis.

945
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,227
Other hand.

946
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,096
On the rare occasion
that black people

947
00:40:10,164 --> 00:40:11,464
Do get skin cancer,

948
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:13,633
They usually get it
on the white parts--

949
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,069
Palms and soles
of the feet.

950
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:20,973
But your hands and feet
are so smashed up from football,

951
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,109
My team are likely
to have written off

952
00:40:23,177 --> 00:40:25,511
Any skin blemish
as a bruise.

953
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:27,346
<i>But now that I know
that melanoma</i>

954
00:40:27,414 --> 00:40:30,016
Is the only thing
that fits...

955
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,386
Come take a look
at this, mom.

956
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:40,793
There's the thorn
in the panther's paw--

957
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:42,128
Paraneoplastic syndrome.

958
00:40:42,196 --> 00:40:44,497
<i>Your body forms antibodies</i>

959
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:45,631
<i>To fight the tumor.</i>

960
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:47,400
Those tiny little proteins

961
00:40:47,468 --> 00:40:49,635
Travel through your blood
and wreak havoc.

962
00:40:49,703 --> 00:40:51,137
We remove the cancerous mole,

963
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:53,005
Everything should be fine.

964
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:56,442
I'll tell dr. Chase
to schedule the surgery.

965
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,610
Why bother?

966
00:40:57,678 --> 00:41:00,379
<i>I missed my shot.</i>

967
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:02,148
What kind of life
am I gonna lead now?

968
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:04,851
Did you study
really, really hard?

969
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:08,588
Then the same crappy life

970
00:41:08,655 --> 00:41:10,289
That the rest of the guys
you'll be graduating with

971
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:12,024
Are gonna lead...

972
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:13,826
Minus the student loans.

973
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,367
Hey.
You ready?

974
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,436
Almost.

975
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:27,607
And...Done.

976
00:41:27,674 --> 00:41:30,543
I heard house and wilson
are getting pranked by someone.

977
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:32,478
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

978
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:33,646
No.

979
00:41:33,714 --> 00:41:35,615
Why should I believe you?

980
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:38,618
You said I had
a trusting face.

981
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:39,952
I still don't understand

982
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,387
Why you wouldn't let me
retaliate, though.

983
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:43,089
They stole your dream.

984
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:45,791
Well, that's overstating it.
It's just a condo.

985
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:49,695
It's not because you feel guilty
about hurting house

986
00:41:49,763 --> 00:41:51,764
Or guilty
for being with me?

987
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:53,199
We'll buy another one.

988
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:55,234
I just don't see the need
to make a war out of it.

989
00:41:55,302 --> 00:41:56,936
Well, I think
you're rationalizing,

990
00:41:57,004 --> 00:41:59,238
Which a less confident man
than myself might take as a sign

991
00:41:59,306 --> 00:42:01,774
That you're
second-guessing.

992
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:04,410
Okay, you know what?
Forget that last part.

993
00:42:06,713 --> 00:42:08,981
I heard foreman
and his brother

994
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:10,750
Are trying
to work things out.

995
00:42:10,817 --> 00:42:11,984
That's nice for them.

996
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:15,188
<i>It's nice of you.</i>

997
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:16,923
<i>You didn't provoke marcus
to quit</i>

998
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,891
<i>So the pranks would stop.</i>

999
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,359
You were becoming
the common enemy

1000
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:21,527
They could bond over.

1001
00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:23,696
<i>You are the diabolical,</i>

1002
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:25,598
Yet benevolent puppet master.

1003
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,833
I provoked marcus to quit

1004
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:30,236
Because he was no longer
useful to me.

1005
00:42:30,304 --> 00:42:31,704
I hired him
to get information.

1006
00:42:31,772 --> 00:42:33,139
<i>I got information.
Uh-huh.</i>

1007
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:34,674
<i>And how are we gonna
get back</i>

1008
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:35,841
At lucas?

1009
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:37,109
We're not.

1010
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:40,413
I win.
