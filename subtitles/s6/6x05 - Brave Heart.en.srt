1
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,021
left! Left! He's going left!

2
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:15,436
I'm gonna have a heart attack.

3
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:55,726
Nowhere to go, buddy.

4
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,768
What the hell was that?
What are we chasing?

5
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,830
Go that way.

6
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:31,185
<i>Up, donny, up. He's going for the roof.</i>

7
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:32,688
<i>He's going up, go.</i>

8
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:38,217
Ow. Damn it.

9
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,771
Just go, go!

10
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,476
Donny, no! It's too far!

11
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:07,325
I can rest at home.

12
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,674
We can't release you
for at least two days.

13
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,849
You have two broken
bones, a severe concussion,

14
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:13,150
Collapsed lung.

15
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:15,950
But you didn't find anything
life-Threatening, right?

16
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:17,953
You fell 30 feet. You should have died.

17
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,593
I think that was the
point. Could you shut up?

18
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:21,453
You have suicidal thoughts?

19
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:22,846
Not once. Never.

20
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:24,178
<i>He doesn't want to kill himself.</i>

21
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,500
He just thinks he's gonna die soon,

22
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,327
So it doesn't really
matter-- Now you shut up.

23
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,978
I'm the one you're not covering
When you pull your crazy stunts.

24
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:31,983
Why do you think you're gonna die soon?

25
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:35,037
Well, my dad, grandfather,
and great-Grandfather

26
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:36,249
All dropped dead of heart problems

27
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:37,558
Right after they turned 40.

28
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,006
Look who turns 40 next week.

29
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,534
I can refer you to a cardiologist,
if you-- Nah, i've been there,

30
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:42,518
<i>All of them.</i>

31
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:44,779
I spent my early 30s going
from one doctor to another.

32
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,572
<i>Every single one says my heart's fine.</i>

33
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:48,540
And you think they're
wrong? I know they're wrong.

34
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:50,141
<i>But what can i do?</i>

35
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,028
At a certain point, you
just got to live your life.

36
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,063
By live your life,

37
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:54,022
<i>You mean risk your life.</i>

38
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:55,643
If there is something wrong,

39
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:57,460
I know a doctor who will find it.

40
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,255
Oh, god! I'll be back in ten.

41
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,892
I'm picking lint out of my belly button.

42
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:09,868
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

43
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:11,997
I'm converting the study into a bedroom.

44
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:12,953
Huh...

45
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:14,620
Six weeks.

46
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,045
<i>Longer than i thought it would take...</i>

47
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,849
For you to notice that i'm
sleeping in your living room,

48
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,346
And offer other options.

49
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,270
I didn't expect you
to be here this long.

50
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,695
True, but that's not why

51
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,139
You didn't extend the invitation.

52
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,010
Do you really need to deconstruct this?

53
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,104
You didn't want me to sleep
where you and amber slept.

54
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:30,921
Okay, yes, you do. After she died,

55
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,517
You converted the study to a bedroom

56
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:33,656
And the bedroom to a study...

57
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,796
Except it's not a study, it's a shrine.

58
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:38,819
Can i tell you something?

59
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,784
I wasn't picking lint
out of my belly button.

60
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:42,721
Okay.

61
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,490
I am not ready to transition

62
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,105
From my dead girlfriend's shrine

63
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:48,484
To your... morning glory.

64
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,559
<i>I'll have a mattress delivered</i>

65
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:51,041
<i>And set up for you in the tabernacle.</i>

66
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,565
I just need it tuesdays
for animal sacrifices.

67
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,703
Oh, man!

68
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:58,972
<i>Ugh.</i>

69
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,186
Patient's a genetic time bomb.

70
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,578
There's no fuse.

71
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:04,708
<i>He's not a bomb.</i>

72
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,094
Right now he's not a patient either.

73
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:09,049
You saying we ignore three
generations of cardiac problems?

74
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:10,054
I'm not ignoring it.

75
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,462
I'm labeling it a coincidence.

76
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,390
You hate coincidence.

77
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,224
We reconciled. It was a whole thing.

78
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,151
<i>Big country.</i>

79
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,753
<i>It's statistically probable that someone</i>

80
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:20,893
Has three generations
that died around age 40

81
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,647
With nongenetic heart issues.

82
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,522
<i>Dice have no memory. Genes do.</i>

83
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,468
If we ran a battery of
tests on every nonsymptomatic

84
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,777
<i>Statistical
anomaly--</i>

85
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:31,055
The guy goes every day assuming
his life will end at age 40.

86
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:32,434
<i>Never got married, no kids,</i>

87
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:33,712
Because he didn't want to die on them

88
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,276
The same way his dad died on him.

89
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:36,865
You want to take this case
'cause he's yet another

90
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,317
<i>Lonely, sad puppy.</i>

91
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,027
You should have been a vet.

92
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,123
It's a legitimate case.

93
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:42,903
differential diagnosis

94
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:44,421
For genetic heart conditions.

95
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,442
That sold you?

96
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,485
Marfan syndrome, brugada. And you?

97
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:50,017
Emilio hypercholesterolemia.

98
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:51,179
He's only agreeing with you

99
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:52,426
<i>'Cause he wants to have sex with you.</i>

100
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:54,027
And by the way, i agree with you too,

101
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:55,357
Especially in those pants.

102
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,173
We're not wasting our time.

103
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:58,942
And last week, chase said

104
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:00,358
That i was the de facto boss.

105
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,404
<i>Hospitals don't recognize</i>

106
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:02,774
De facto medical licenses.

107
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,301
Let's start with genetic tests.

108
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:05,747
<i>Get an ekg,
cardiac cath--</i>

109
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:07,727
And an echo to check the
integrity of his heart.

110
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:10,892
I'll start on blood samples.

111
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:25,979
Ugh...

112
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:28,911
<i>I forgot my watch. Could have sworn</i>

113
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,781
<i>I saw you put it on this morning.
Must be in the locker room.</i>

114
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:31,796
I'll be right back.

115
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,066
I need to know what your plans are.

116
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:40,583
First we take berlin.

117
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,786
And then we circle around behind poland

118
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:44,043
And yell, "surprise!"

119
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,404
With regards to your employment.

120
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:47,365
I like things the way they are.

121
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:49,414
I get just enough puzzle to solve

122
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,902
Without the scornful visits from you...

123
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:53,387
Until now.

124
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,002
Pretend time's been
going on long enough.

125
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,529
I don't have a medical license.
All i can do is pretend.

126
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,020
And i'm gonna have payroll send you over

127
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:00,677
Some pretend checks starting tomorrow.

128
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:03,986
You need to complete 120
hours of rounds to re-Qualify.

129
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:07,368
No, i don't.

130
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:09,730
I'm not saying you don't win.

131
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,284
I'm just saying do you really need

132
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,385
To punish me by making
me carry a clipboard

133
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,794
For your lackey of the week?

134
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:15,958
It's a state requirement.

135
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:18,011
I have to certify that you've
completed all your require--

136
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:19,139
Exactly.

137
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,866
The requirement sets
out what you have to do--

138
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:22,296
Certify, which you can do

139
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:23,699
With one hand tied behind your back.

140
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:25,366
Now, if you want to tie my hands...

141
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,948
Dr. Singh supervises
rounds on thursdays,

142
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:29,582
Starts at 7:00.

143
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:37,600
Nothing.

144
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,443
So what now?

145
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,627
Send him home.

146
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:42,517
To continue believing
he's gonna drop dead?

147
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,343
When he turns 70, he'll believe us.

148
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:45,954
There are other things we can check.

149
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,007
skeleton of great-Grandfather's
in decent shape.

150
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:51,676
<i>Subsurface genetic material
from grandpa's fine,</i>

151
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,826
<i>Leaving one bowl of purified dad.</i>

152
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:54,723
You do the dad.

153
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:56,847
I take it he had a sealed casket.

154
00:07:57,587 --> 00:07:59,439
The watch story was crap, right?

155
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:02,065
I forgot it.

156
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:03,751
It's no big deal.

157
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:05,245
<i>You were avoiding the icu</i>

158
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,277
Where dibala died.

159
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:10,620
I'll sequence the gene for
the cardiac sodium channel.

160
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,827
I felt like i was gonna
have a panic attack.

161
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:18,337
I've crossed some line...

162
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,315
And i'm having trouble
getting back to the other side.

163
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:26,252
I can move the patient to another room.

164
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:28,152
Cameron will ask questions.

165
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:29,859
You should tell her.

166
00:08:30,465 --> 00:08:31,379
<i>She's your wife.</i>

167
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:39,282
How'd you get a court order
to dig them up so fast?

168
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:40,862
We just needed the guy's consent.

169
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,651
you find anything? Not yet.

170
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:44,331
But you're just in time to do the dad.

171
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:50,745
<i>Doctor house?</i>

172
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:52,311
He'll be back in the morning.

173
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,776
I read in the paper You're
treating a police officer.

174
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:56,653
Donny compson? Second floor.

175
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:58,315
A nurse will help you find him.

176
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:00,072
I don't want to see him.

177
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,698
Donny and i used to
go out a long time ago.

178
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:04,605
He doesn't want to see me.
I don't want to see him.

179
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:06,777
So did you come to see
me for personal advice?

180
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,163
You're looking for genetic conditions,

181
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:11,189
Which makes sense, with what
happened to his dad and grandpa.

182
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:13,544
Unless you were his
girlfriend and his sister,

183
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:14,848
You got nothing to worry about.

184
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:15,989
I'm not worried about me.

185
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,209
<i>Donny doesn't know this,</i>

186
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:18,578
But he has a son.

187
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:24,427
Dial extension 742.

188
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:26,937
Tell dr. Foreman you got
some cool information.

189
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,026
Good night.

190
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:26,584
You okay?

191
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:28,230
Yeah, fine.

192
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:01,703
Couldn't find any
consistent genetic mutations

193
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,117
Across 15 areas between
donny's ancestors,

194
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:06,230
Possibly indicating there isn't one.

195
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,710
but the son gives us a new data point.

196
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:08,999
And undegraded dna.

197
00:11:09,057 --> 00:11:10,030
I thought he didn't want kids.

198
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,065
<i>He didn't. Where's house?</i>

199
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,080
"Dear bleeding hearts,

200
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:15,193
"Since your patient's med
history is a coincidence,

201
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:16,228
"And he isn't...

202
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:20,199
"Sick,

203
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:21,328
<i>"I've gone back to school.</i>

204
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:22,577
<i>Back in 120 hours."</i>

205
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:24,175
Charming. I'll get a blood sample.

206
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:26,279
If we're looking for something
as subtle as a mutation,

207
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:28,349
It makes sense to get the
dna where it's most pure.

208
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,890
You're gonna ask the mom to
consent to a bone marrow biopsy?

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,573
<i>She wants to  know if there's
something wrong with donny</i>

210
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:33,754
<i>Just as badly as we do.</i>

211
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:34,651
Right.

212
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:36,871
Spike a ten-Year-Old's hip
because grandpa was sick.

213
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:37,763
<i>If she's right...</i>

214
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:38,884
We save two people.

215
00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:45,383
I don't want to.

216
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,284
Can we speak outside for a moment?

217
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:51,067
Yeah.

218
00:11:58,243 --> 00:11:59,093
You need to tell him.

219
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:01,407
I can't.

220
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,126
His father is down that hallway

221
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:04,262
Through those double doors.

222
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:05,783
I've been lying to him his whole life.

223
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:06,919
What's he gonna think of me?

224
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,036
You're trying to protect him.

225
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:11,269
Donny never wanted kids.

226
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:13,667
He certainly doesn't want to meet him.

227
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:15,703
If donny does die, this could be

228
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,559
Michael's only chance
to meet his father.

229
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,474
After administration of immunoglobulin,

230
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,412
Patient had no further pain, and
overnight liver function tests

231
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:36,488
<i>Are now normal.</i>

232
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:37,728
Patient's ready to be released.

233
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:40,053
stats are dropping.

234
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:41,724
Doctor singh? She's choking.

235
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:44,201
<i>On your fingers. She can't breathe.</i>

236
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:45,311
<i>House...</i>

237
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,072
Please take your finger
off the test button.

238
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,787
I see. Wow, sorry about that.

239
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:54,333
I could've slit her throat.

240
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:55,712
Well, we're all here to learn.

241
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,403
You know, dr. Cuddy warned me about you.

242
00:12:57,513 --> 00:12:58,632
She tell you how to stop me?

243
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:02,426
Look, i'm asking you as
an adult to please stop.

244
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:04,370
well, that obviously
didn't come from her.

245
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,921
But fair enough.

246
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:09,132
Excellent presentation, nona.

247
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,021
<i>Ah!</i>

248
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:12,290
Now i've done it.

249
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:14,253
There's urine everywhere!

250
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,401
Gosh. The great thing

251
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:18,276
About the teacher-Student
relationship is the teacher

252
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:20,419
Can often learn more from the student.

253
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:23,914
Have you learned anything yet?

254
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:30,138
You have a son.

255
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,330
I was pregnant when we broke up.

256
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:35,601
I'm sorry i never told you,

257
00:13:35,673 --> 00:13:37,280
But i knew how you
felt about having kids.

258
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:39,455
You had no right.

259
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:40,906
Maybe.

260
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:42,667
It's a little late for that.

261
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:48,718
He's here.

262
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:50,243
He wants to meet you.

263
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:51,426
I don't want to meet him.

264
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,280
I've never asked you for a dime.

265
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,592
He's here to help find

266
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:56,036
Whatever's wrong with your heart.

267
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:57,109
I didn't ask him.

268
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:58,860
I didn't want him.

269
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,006
Just say hi to him.

270
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:15,922
Hi.

271
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:17,977
<i>I'm michael.</i>

272
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:20,522
Hi.

273
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:23,810
I'm your--
Uh...

274
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,166
Yeah, your mother told me.

275
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:28,358
When you get better,

276
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,205
Maybe we could do something.

277
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,015
See a movie?

278
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:40,065
No.

279
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:42,694
<i>My dad died when i was your age.</i>

280
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:44,847
It was the most painful
thing i ever went through.

281
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,566
<i>Trust me, as much as i'm
sure this hurts right now,</i>

282
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:49,491
<i>It's better.</i>

283
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:52,829
Please take him out of here.

284
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:04,815
Chromosomes for 28
cardiovascular conditions

285
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:06,283
<i>Are normally numbered in structure.</i>

286
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:08,665
<i>No translocations,
deletions, or inversions.</i>

287
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,133
I didn't notice that the
kid's d-A-D-D-Y chromosome

288
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,685
Has been severely damaged

289
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:15,750
By someone else's
bleeding heart chromosome.

290
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:18,051
It was the only way to get
michael to do the marrow biopsy.

291
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,315
I'm sure there are plenty of lies

292
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:20,446
Would've worked just as well,

293
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:22,404
Except without the years of therapy.

294
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:23,564
Don't you have school? Recess.

295
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:25,627
So where does that leave us?

296
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:26,583
Chase?

297
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:29,197
Sorry. What?

298
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:31,514
I was saying, "do you think these shoes

299
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:32,779
Work in this color?"

300
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,949
Send him home.

301
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,152
He's not gonna believe he's healthy.

302
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,372
You're not very good at your job.

303
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:39,458
You don't deserve candy.
He's been preparing

304
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:41,471
<i>His whole life to die at age 40.</i>

305
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,665
He's had dozens of doctors

306
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,933
<i>Tell him he's fine.</i>

307
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:45,517
<i>You think you can change his thinking?</i>

308
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,647
Yeah, i do. Chase, walk with me.

309
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,530
Great contributions back there.

310
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:54,453
There's no case. I had nothing to add.

311
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,026
You had nothing to add...

312
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,141
Because you were distracted.

313
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,584
<i>A little devil on your shoulder</i>

314
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:02,537
Told you to kill a guy, and now
the little angel won't shut up,

315
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:05,093
<i>Telling you you're gonna
burn in a lake of fire.</i>

316
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:06,418
I'm fine.

317
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:07,483
You shouldn't be.

318
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,590
Talk to someone.

319
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:12,310
Docs fixed me up in seven weeks.

320
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,219
You're... ten minutes, tops.

321
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:18,807
Thanks.

322
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,968
Glad we had this little moment.

323
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:23,049
Come on.

324
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:26,509
<i>I'm dr. House.</i>

325
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,087
You couldn't find anything, could you?

326
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,506
You have ortoli syndrome.

327
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,618
<i>Dr. Chase?</i>

328
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,177
<i>You sure? Tests don't lie.</i>

329
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:35,804
Right.

330
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:39,311
Well,
it's--It's a...

331
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,217
It's a very rare disorder

332
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:44,843
That short-Circuits the adrenals,

333
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:46,390
Which short-Circuits the heart.

334
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:47,962
<i>Blah, blah, blah, blah. Who cares</i>

335
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,462
About medical mumbo jumbo?

336
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:50,517
Tell him the treatment.

337
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:53,414
It's... well,
it's--It's complicated.

338
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,937
Doctors always want to make
everything sound so complicated.

339
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,978
It's nabasynth.

340
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:58,955
What? Nabasynth.

341
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:01,279
Yes.

342
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,589
So all we have to do now
is write a prescription

343
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,845
And, uh, have him pick up the pills.

344
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:15,954
That's it?

345
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,172
I take some pills,
and i'm gonna be okay?

346
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,597
The real tragedy here is

347
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:22,672
That the tiburon swab technology

348
00:17:22,768 --> 00:17:25,514
Didn't exist to detect
ortoli back in your dad's day.

349
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,205
He could've lived.

350
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:36,682
Thank you.

351
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:43,691
If you'll sign these discharge papers,

352
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,071
I'll get you a bottle of meds.

353
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,007
Take one twice a day for a week,

354
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:48,755
You'll live a long, healthy life.

355
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,432
<i>Answer the door, house.</i>

356
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:27,678
<i>It's got to be for you.</i>

357
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,664
Are you watching tv?

358
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:32,171
It's the door!

359
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:37,184
Were you on the phone? No.

360
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,419
Just now, were you
talking? No. I'm alone.

361
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,552
You okay, house?

362
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:46,376
Why are you here?

363
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:50,148
Donny collapsed four hours
after we discharged him.

364
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:51,703
He's dead.

365
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,525
His apartment manager found him

366
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:00,738
On the floor in the laundry room.

367
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,030
Said he wasn't breathing.

368
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:05,173
He called the emts, but it was too late.

369
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,190
I sent the guy home with mints.

370
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,628
Whatever it is, we all missed it.

371
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:13,527
I missed the fact that
there was something to miss.

372
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,402
What is wrong with me?

373
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,307
You had good reason.

374
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:21,733
Patient presented with no symptoms,

375
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:23,388
And all his tests came back negative.

376
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,759
What's the official cause of death?

377
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:29,429
Autopsy hasn't been performed yet.

378
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,329
Emts brought him to general,

379
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,932
But i requested they ship him back

380
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:35,918
To our morgue for the postmortem.

381
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:40,018
Good.

382
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:45,363
Hon. Wake up.

383
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,370
Why are you dressed?

384
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:51,999
You go to sleep?

385
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:54,157
I want to go tell
cheryl that donny died.

386
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,506
It's 4:00 in the morning.

387
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:59,009
They're nearly two hours away.

388
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:01,280
I figure by the time i
get there, she'll be awake.

389
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:02,681
Babe, come back to bed.

390
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,111
Call her in a few hours.

391
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:08,010
It's the sort of thing she
needs to hear face-To-Face.

392
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:16,763
Is everything okay?

393
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,115
Everything's fine.

394
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:20,175
<i>Why?</i>

395
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:22,998
Last week, i understood
that you were stressed out

396
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:25,230
About the dibala "m" and "m,"
and i gave you your space.

397
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:28,156
But that's over now, and
you're still acting...

398
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,746
I'm worried about you.

399
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,041
Don't be.

400
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:37,176
I'm fine.

401
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,694
Really.

402
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:41,808
And you'd tell me if you weren't?

403
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:45,256
Promise?

404
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:48,298
Yeah.

405
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:50,826
Okay.

406
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:55,355
Hey.

407
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:57,817
I love you.

408
00:20:58,806 --> 00:20:59,900
I love you too.

409
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:10,715
Donny compson, age 39.

410
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:33,549
<i>Can we cut to the money shot?</i>

411
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:36,992
It's his heart, so
let's look at his heart.

412
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:40,039
Nice y-Incision.

413
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:42,042
You can't perform an autopsy
without a medical license.

414
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:43,706
Really?

415
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:46,194
'Cause i don't think there's
anything i could screw up

416
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:47,564
That we haven't already screwed up.

417
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:56,552
Opening postmortem incision.

418
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,154
Beginning at the midline of the sternum.

419
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:11,398
That's odd.

420
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:13,504
<i>It almost looks like he's...</i>

421
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:14,702
Bleeding.

422
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,524
I think the autopsy's gonna
have to wait a little bit.

423
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:35,646
he was briefly conscious,

424
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,753
<i>Then his systolic dipped below 60,</i>

425
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:38,867
<i>And he was out again.</i>

426
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,767
Differential diagnosis for resurrection.

427
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:42,372
<i>Go. Obviously he wasn't dead.</i>

428
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:44,054
<i>His heart slowed
enough that the emts--</i>

429
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:46,622
Yes, the fact that he's not
dead means we did absolutely

430
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:47,643
<i>Nothing wrong.</i>

431
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:48,821
<i>There's several documented cases</i>

432
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,275
Where tetrodotoxin ingestion
caused apparent death.

433
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:53,253
It wasn't something he ate.
It's something he already had.

434
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:54,136
And his dad,

435
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:56,175
<i>And his grandpa, and--
Extreme bradycardia</i>

436
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,189
Could be caused by sick sinus syndrome.

437
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:00,425
<i>Sinoatrial block. What
if it's not his heart?</i>

438
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:04,131
Let's work from the tenuous assumption

439
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:05,239
That we're not idiots

440
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:07,041
<i>Who've spent days examining a heart</i>

441
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,512
Up, down,
sideways--

442
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:10,310
<i>Declaring it healthy just a few hours</i>

443
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:11,742
<i>Before it basically shut down.</i>

444
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:14,580
So we need to think about
causes in places you didn't look.

445
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:18,773
<i>Could be metabolic.</i>

446
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,374
You okay?

447
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:25,634
Yeah.

448
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,140
What about a genetic predisposition

449
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:29,760
To an autoimmune disease?

450
00:23:29,897 --> 00:23:31,325
Isolated anti-Ro antibody

451
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:32,803
<i>Could cause complete heart block.</i>

452
00:23:32,872 --> 00:23:34,316
Could also be passed
through four generations.

453
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:35,591
Autoimmune it is.

454
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:36,794
<i>Start him on steroids.</i>

455
00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:45,037
Hey. How you feeling?

456
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:48,156
My whole head is killing me.

457
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,033
You just came through a severe trauma.

458
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,487
What do you remember?

459
00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:00,042
I was changing my
laundry over to the dryer.

460
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:03,005
<i>That's it?</i>

461
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:04,369
You were declared dead.

462
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:06,022
You made it all the way to autopsy.

463
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,060
my jaw aches.

464
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:13,575
And obviously i don't
have ortoli syndrome.

465
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:16,228
<i>It's hard to get too excited</i>

466
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:17,532
<i>About coming back from the dead</i>

467
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:19,392
<i>When anything i do,
anything you give me--</i>

468
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,744
It all ends the same way.

469
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,576
Outer and middle ear respond well.

470
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,630
Hearing thresholds are
normal at all frequencies.

471
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:42,150
Eardrum is perfectly healthy.

472
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,606
What if i, uh...

473
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,270
If i sometimes hear whispering?

474
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:47,914
Then you're probably
hearing someone whispering.

475
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:51,851
I had some dental work
done in the philippines

476
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,005
When i was a kid.

477
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,683
Adjoining metal fillings could corrode

478
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:56,317
And pick up a.M. Radio signals.

479
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,319
Open your mouth.

480
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:00,911
Your fillings don't touch.

481
00:25:03,516 --> 00:25:05,396
So there's no reason for
me to be hearing things.

482
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:07,568
I can only tell you that you're
hearing sounds as you should.

483
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:09,097
<i>If you're also hearing
sounds that you shouldn't,</i>

484
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:10,241
<i>Well, that would be psychosis.</i>

485
00:25:10,356 --> 00:25:12,022
You'd have to talk to
someone who does brain.

486
00:25:12,155 --> 00:25:13,071
I only do ears.

487
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:23,515
Bravo!

488
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,984
It's amazing how you
did 120 hours in one day.

489
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:29,711
I wasn't on my best behavior.

490
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,857
I admit.

491
00:25:31,212 --> 00:25:32,291
Allow me.

492
00:25:33,483 --> 00:25:34,693
From now on, i'm gonna supervise

493
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:37,100
Your practicum requirements.
That won't be necessary.

494
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:38,767
You want to annoy another doctor first?

495
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,161
Eventually-- It's
not necessary,

496
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:42,600
Because i'm not ready
to be a doctor again.

497
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:46,952
I'm sorry.

498
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:08,888
Are you sleeping out here?

499
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:11,401
Just...dozed off in front of the tv.

500
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:12,457
With bedding?

501
00:26:12,557 --> 00:26:13,448
Maybe!

502
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:15,538
<i>I can't sleep in there.</i>

503
00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:17,054
The heater's screwed up.

504
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,272
If you need to talk...

505
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,103
<i>If--If you
need more help--</i>

506
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,482
I'm just tired.

507
00:26:23,175 --> 00:26:24,729
I'm right here.

508
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,885
Great.

509
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:27,839
Can you be right here somewhere else?

510
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:36,638
My jaw still hurts.

511
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:39,424
My tooth--
Actually, a lot.

512
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,488
I'm sorry, you're maxed
out on your pain meds.

513
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:42,616
Try to sleep.

514
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:08,699
Dentist looked at the
tooth the guy pulled out.

515
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:09,993
There was nothing wrong with it.

516
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:12,439
So aside from him being an idiot,

517
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:13,626
What else have we learned?

518
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:15,162
The pain is real. It's
coming from somewhere.

519
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:17,407
What about bone cancer?

520
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,712
You can't connect bone
cancer to the heart.

521
00:27:19,823 --> 00:27:21,643
House figure this can
wait till the morning?

522
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:24,150
Actually, he told cuddy
he's not ready to work.

523
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:25,967
He quit?

524
00:27:26,198 --> 00:27:28,022
Apparently. It's a power play.

525
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:29,248
<i>He'll be back tomorrow.</i>

526
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,389
Bone cancer could trigger
a paraneoplastic syndrome,

527
00:27:32,507 --> 00:27:33,654
Which shuts down the heart.

528
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:35,751
Primary bone cancer isn't hereditary.

529
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:37,356
Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

530
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:38,707
<i>It's hereditary, and it increases</i>

531
00:27:38,797 --> 00:27:40,240
A person's risk of having bone cancer.

532
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:44,904
You have another theory?

533
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:47,032
My theory is it's not bone cancer.

534
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:50,070
Gamma survey would locate the tumors.

535
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:08,776
i had pea soup today.

536
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,826
You'd love my breath right now.

537
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,806
<i>I didn't get a chance to run tonight.</i>

538
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,814
<i>House is... is having issues.</i>

539
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:20,783
<i>I missed you a lot today.</i>

540
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:23,910
All i want to do is...

541
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:28,694
<i>You know.</i>

542
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:36,543
No cancers on the
lateral cuneiform bone.

543
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,468
Navicular's also clean.

544
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:40,695
Chase is lying to me.

545
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,682
And i know you know.

546
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:45,298
Tell me what's going on, please.

547
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:46,876
I'm gonna tell you the
same thing i told him...

548
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:48,338
Talk to your spouse.

549
00:29:56,483 --> 00:29:57,375
No breakfast?

550
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:59,220
Not today.

551
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:01,740
I'm hallucinating.

552
00:30:05,481 --> 00:30:06,454
What happened?

553
00:30:06,576 --> 00:30:08,063
It's nothing visual this time.

554
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:10,917
<i>I hear whispering.</i>

555
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:13,580
Is that why you've been acting so weird?

556
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,295
<i>Is that why you quit? I'm losing it.</i>

557
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,130
I'm sure there's a rational explanation.

558
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:19,160
The wind?

559
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:21,147
<i>A neighbor's tv? I checked everything.</i>

560
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:23,043
What's really scary is
that i hear whispering

561
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,498
While not on vicodin.

562
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:29,469
I'm gonna check myself
back into mayfield.

563
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,986
Okay.

564
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:37,532
Okay?

565
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:42,415
You don't think there might
be a logical explanation?

566
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:43,686
Something i missed?

567
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:45,276
You're the smartest guy i know.

568
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:46,773
If you haven't thought
of it, it doesn't exist.

569
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:48,841
<i>I'll drive you over.</i>

570
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,607
I just need to make some tea first.

571
00:30:54,972 --> 00:30:55,829
You know.

572
00:30:57,495 --> 00:30:59,259
That you're an ass? Yeah.

573
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:01,349
<i>You overheard me talking
to my dead girlfriend</i>

574
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:03,351
And thought to yourself, "hmm...

575
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:05,246
What kind of fun can i have with this?"

576
00:31:05,353 --> 00:31:06,605
Why are you talking to her?

577
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:07,949
You run out of living people?

578
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:09,345
You can talk to me. I'm right here.

579
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:10,920
I miss her.

580
00:31:11,025 --> 00:31:12,314
Talking to her makes me feel better.

581
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:13,550
You don't.

582
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:19,230
Patient lauren maybaum, 27,

583
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:22,186
Presented two days ago
with severe abdominal pain.

584
00:31:22,854 --> 00:31:23,874
Sorry i'm late.

585
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:25,563
Yesterday you said you weren't ready.

586
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:26,430
Yesterday i wasn't.

587
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:28,241
Today i am. And tomorrow

588
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:30,513
Is it possible for me to
get a five-Day forecast?

589
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,796
I'm feeling much better.
Thank you for not asking.

590
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,306
Either you did
have a problem--

591
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:35,755
Which i can't ignore.

592
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:37,525
Or you were
jerking me around--

593
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:39,630
Which i can't ignore. You are a woman.

594
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:40,778
You can do anything.

595
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:43,330
For example, i can talk to you outside.

596
00:31:47,392 --> 00:31:49,050
Are you sure you're only one woman?

597
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:54,102
This is the part where

598
00:31:54,193 --> 00:31:55,729
You play the employee,
and i play the boss.

599
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,682
I can see your nipples. Your turn.

600
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:00,038
These kids are-- No
wonder she hates him.

601
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,431
Mm, that's not hate.

602
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:04,972
<i>It's foreplay. It's inappropriate.</i>

603
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:09,991
Gamma survey revealed no tumors.

604
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:11,672
So it's not bone cancer.

605
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:13,429
where's chase?

606
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:15,264
Don't know.

607
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:16,523
Hm.

608
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:18,055
Two mysteries, cool.

609
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:19,650
Theories?

610
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:23,958
Did i come in too soon?

611
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:25,929
Okay, i'm gonna take another lap.

612
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:28,825
And i want three new ideas
by the time i come back.

613
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:30,449
One of them's got to be not stupid.

614
00:32:35,282 --> 00:32:38,205
Where there's pain... there's nerves.

615
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,757
Hereditary sensory autonomic
neuropathy, type one.

616
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:44,623
Miscommunication in the brain stem

617
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:46,579
Mistakes nerve pain for tooth pain.

618
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:47,835
It would explain the bradycardia too.

619
00:32:47,954 --> 00:32:49,554
And i like the word
"hereditary" in the title.

620
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:50,875
Carbamazepine fixes him.

621
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:52,451
I'll get him started on the medication.

622
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:55,397
Nope, chase specifically
asked if he could do it.

623
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:03,169
Sleep at home.

624
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,345
So i didn't do the gamma survey.

625
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:08,627
Is it bone cancer? No.

626
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,885
You should congratulate me
for not wasting your time.

627
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,042
Are you getting some help?

628
00:33:12,716 --> 00:33:14,604
Or is this the way things
are gonna be from now on?

629
00:33:14,913 --> 00:33:17,694
What's pathetic is
you haven't gotten help

630
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:20,500
Because you want to feel bad.

631
00:33:21,177 --> 00:33:22,131
You want to suffer,

632
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:24,838
'Cause if you feel guilty,
then you're not a psychopath.

633
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:27,642
Patient needs some carbamazepine.

634
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:29,705
Now, i don't care how
much that room scares you,

635
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,228
You're doing your job.

636
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,588
<i>How long before you cross</i>

637
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,846
This one off the list?

638
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:53,843
A couple of hours.

639
00:33:58,013 --> 00:33:59,014
You ever shoot anyone?

640
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,180
Twice.

641
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:03,203
You ever kill anyone?

642
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,452
No.

643
00:34:05,597 --> 00:34:07,314
<i>I know a few guys who did, though.</i>

644
00:34:08,034 --> 00:34:09,449
Did they ever get over it?

645
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,820
<i>A captain i know compares
it to taking out the trash,</i>

646
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:13,622
<i>Like it's nothing.</i>

647
00:34:14,892 --> 00:34:16,317
Other hand, i got an ex-Partner

648
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,178
Who nearly drank himself into oblivion.

649
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:20,604
Did he get help?

650
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:21,894
Yeah.

651
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:23,971
Help didn't help.

652
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,861
Oh, god!

653
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:33,619
What is it?

654
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:35,592
I went to the bathroom.

655
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,004
Patient's lost bowel control.

656
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,551
Means we were wrong about h-San,

657
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:45,614
And it means he's getting worse fast.

658
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,946
Wouldn't want to be the duty nurse

659
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:48,895
<i>Assigned to his floor. Get it?</i>

660
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:50,543
"Doody" nurse?

661
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,240
Fine. Do the doctor thing.

662
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:54,746
<i>An autoimmune disorder
could explain--</i>

663
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:56,399
We put him on steroids.
He didn't respond.

664
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:58,043
It's not autoimmune.
Could be wilson's disease.

665
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,090
A disease that advanced
would've hit the liver.

666
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:01,971
It is possible the liver's so far gone,

667
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:03,244
The labs look normal.

668
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,463
<i>It's worth a shot.</i>

669
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:08,091
Go treat with penicillamine.

670
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:11,314
<i>And when he doesn't get
better, come back quickly,</i>

671
00:35:11,406 --> 00:35:12,880
So we can get one more shot at it.

672
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:20,159
Bless me, father, for i have sinned.

673
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:27,588
take your time.

674
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:32,567
<i>How long has it been
since your last confession?</i>

675
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:33,758
I killed a man.

676
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:36,712
<i>Oh?</i>

677
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:38,532
But it was the right thing to do.

678
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,069
Who lives or dies is not
your decision to make.

679
00:35:44,798 --> 00:35:47,455
Sometimes in the operating
room it feels like it.

680
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:49,772
I'm a doctor.

681
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:52,949
<i>Well, then you should
know more than anybody</i>

682
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:56,002
<i>That every human life is sacred.</i>

683
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:58,137
Why?

684
00:35:58,772 --> 00:36:01,020
Tell me what's sacred about a dictator

685
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,579
That kills hundreds of
thousands of his own people.

686
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,988
<i>What is sacred about a
doctor who kills a patient?</i>

687
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:14,387
Is it just the slippery
slope you're worried about?

688
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:16,857
Afraid that forgiving me for killing

689
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:22,514
I promise...

690
00:36:23,106 --> 00:36:24,277
I won't tell anyone.

691
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,823
Just forgive me.

692
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:36,857
<i>Saying ten hail risn't
going to do you any good.</i>

693
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:39,685
Then what do i have to do?

694
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:44,158
What does god need me to do?

695
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:45,743
<i>You can't have absolution</i>

696
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:47,868
<i>Without first taking responsibility.</i>

697
00:36:48,697 --> 00:36:50,776
You have to turn
yourself into the police.

698
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:52,008
What...

699
00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:54,394
And go to jail for the rest of my life?

700
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:56,551
What's just about that?

701
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:01,661
I did the right thing.

702
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:03,913
There has to be another way.

703
00:37:04,073 --> 00:37:07,069
<i>You want absolution, i've
told you how to get it.</i>

704
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,362
Send this into the
state licensing board.

705
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:34,330
I've signed off on all your hours.

706
00:37:35,981 --> 00:37:36,854
Why?

707
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:38,385
Because it's easier this way.

708
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,356
You're uncomfortable with me.

709
00:37:41,118 --> 00:37:42,122
No.

710
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:44,535
Going by the book was pointless.

711
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:45,908
You were gonna learn nothing.

712
00:37:45,983 --> 00:37:48,078
Good, i thought it was
because of the sexual tension.

713
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,347
There was no sexual tension.

714
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:50,322
There was tension.

715
00:37:50,414 --> 00:37:53,428
And...it made me feel funny, so...

716
00:37:54,098 --> 00:37:55,360
Here.

717
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,123
<i>That's too bad.</i>

718
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:01,867
<i>I was kind of getting into the whole</i>

719
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:03,643
Hot-For-Teacher
thing.

720
00:38:04,803 --> 00:38:06,249
You sure you're okay?

721
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,426
Yeah. False alarm.

722
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:13,431
What about us?

723
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:15,820
We're good...

724
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,258
<i>Just like this.</i>

725
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:18,771
You press my buttons, i press yours.

726
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:19,968
By buttons, you mean...

727
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:27,559
Huh.

728
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:36,227
You do make me feel funny.

729
00:38:44,964 --> 00:38:46,218
You're not gonna die.

730
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,131
I've accepted it.

731
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:49,433
It's okay.

732
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:52,982
In addition to high arches

733
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:55,891
And some crystal bowl
in the shape of a tuna,

734
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:59,485
You also inherited a
self-Destruct button.

735
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:02,606
It forms in the brain stem.

736
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:04,215
<i>Technically, it's an aneurysm.</i>

737
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:05,362
<i>Presses on the nerves,</i>

738
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,625
<i>That control everything from
tooth pain to heart rate.</i>

739
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:09,694
<i>As you get older, it gets bigger,</i>

740
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:10,944
<i>Until finally...</i>

741
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,642
The
button--

742
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:14,853
Which i'll call
intracranial berry aneurysm,

743
00:39:14,926 --> 00:39:16,547
'Cause i had a friend in
high school with that name--

744
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:19,299
<i>Stops the signal from
your brain to your heart.</i>

745
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:20,895
<i>And bam!</i>

746
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,962
How do i know you're
not still lying to me?

747
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:26,290
Saying i'm healthy just
to make me feel better?

748
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,781
It does sound that way, doesn't it?

749
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:30,132
But this time, no sugar pills.

750
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:31,543
I'm gonna cut into your brain

751
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:33,293
To make you think that i'm fixing it.

752
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:35,554
And if our fake tests confirm it,

753
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,079
I'm gonna be cutting
into your son's brain too,

754
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:39,709
'Cause i'm just that committed.

755
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:41,786
Michael's gonna be okay?

756
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:45,982
Unless he walks out of here
and gets run over by a bus,

757
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,346
In which case, i will
reconsider your fate argument.

758
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:51,963
You want to give him a call?

759
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,445
Visiting hours don't
apply to my patients.

760
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:57,285
Yeah...

761
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:58,553
In a bit.

762
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,407
Yeah.

763
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:02,441
That's what i thought.

764
00:40:03,404 --> 00:40:05,861
The "saving the kid from
pain" stuff was crap.

765
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:07,946
You just don't want
anything in your life

766
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,714
That won't let you do whatever
the hell you want to do

767
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,092
Whenever the hell you want to do it.

768
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,890
You've had it easy.

769
00:40:12,997 --> 00:40:15,099
Sorry to screw you up.

770
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:53,132
Maybe when we get out of here...

771
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,265
What kind of movies you like?

772
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:09,753
He's been missing for eight hours.

773
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:10,957
<i>Robert chase.</i>

774
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,220
<i>C-H-A-S-E.
Hey!</i>

775
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:19,575
Never mind, he just walked in, sorry.

776
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:21,551
<i>You could've called me.</i>

777
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:23,438
oh, i-I forgot.

778
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:25,013
To call me? It's 2:00 in the morning.

779
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:26,395
Where were you?

780
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:27,735
Ooh, you're drunk.

781
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:29,153
All right, i...

782
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,984
I needed to get wasted. I did.

783
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:35,797
And now i'm better.

784
00:41:36,451 --> 00:41:37,762
What aren't you telling me?

785
00:41:37,987 --> 00:41:39,013
Nothing.

786
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:26,044
Hi, dad.

787
00:42:46,693 --> 00:42:47,773
Wilson.

788
00:42:48,168 --> 00:42:49,505
This is stupid.

789
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,394
You see, he really is getting better.

9999
