1
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:27,734
I guess everybody else
is dead...

2
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:29,601
Which means
we're totally outnumbered.

3
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:32,434
We got to make up
for that in pure firepower.

4
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:34,933
You want to raid
the feeding area, don't you?

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,134
<i>Two boxes of grenades
in there. </i>

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,467
<i>It's our only chance
at getting out. </i>

7
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:42,567
Uh, Vince, that place
is a death trap.

8
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,501
Lucky for you,
I've got the mega-Blaster.

9
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,334
Lee, you go right.
Roy, straight down the middle.

10
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:50,734
I'll cover you both.

11
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:59,701
1, 2, 3!

12
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:09,868
Where's that cover fire?

13
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:12,534
Mega-Blaster, dude.
Mega-Blaster!

14
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:18,601
Aah!
What the hell?

15
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:22,634
Got it!
Vince, where are you?

16
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:25,334
Ah, I can't get them
off of me!

17
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:32,100
Vince, you d-Bag,
where are you?

18
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,300
Damn it. Damn it.

19
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:36,567
Damn it, Vince.

20
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:39,200
Ah.

21
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:40,734
That blood look
funny to you?

22
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,701
Still working on it.
The code's a little janky.

23
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:45,534
Hey, boss, you just like
watching us

24
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:47,000
Get our asses shredded?

25
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,768
Yeah, not that
you're not hilarious,

26
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,634
But we hit the shelves
in three months.

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,933
Vince?

28
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,734
Vince, what's wrong?

29
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,768
My hands.
They're on fire.

30
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:46,134
<i>Your ncv test was normal.
Rules out carpal tunnel. </i>

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,768
No evidence of trauma.
Your blood work looks normal.

32
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,634
Then what is it?
I don't know.

33
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,434
I'll arrange to have you
transferred to a neurologist.

34
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,801
<i>A neurologist?</i>

35
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:55,734
Don't you have some famous
diagnostics guy?

36
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,768
What's he doing?

37
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,701
I quit.

38
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,667
You can't quit.

39
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,734
I think you're confusing me
with jake gyllenhaal.

40
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:13,900
House, are you okay? Yeah,
and I want to stay that way.

41
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:15,634
<i>Talked it over
with my therapist. </i>

42
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,567
I need to change
my environment, my habits.

43
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:18,467
<i>But he cleared you</i>

44
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:20,134
To get your license back.

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,967
Which will help immensely
with my new job in research.

46
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,667
<i>I've sent out
some resumes. </i>

47
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:26,000
Research means no patients,
less pressure.

48
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,367
<i>Well, you just got out. </i>

49
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:29,267
Have you had enough time
to think this through?

50
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:34,933
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,367
I know this will affect
both of you...

52
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,234
And Thirteen...

53
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,267
And the one with the nose.

54
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:46,234
I just can't risk
coming back here.

55
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:52,234
Okay.

56
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,534
<i>That was surprising. </i>

57
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,601
I want to run the department.

58
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,834
You consider waiting
until House clears the lobby

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,567
Before you start angling
for his job?

60
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:20,167
He's not dead or sentimental
and somebody needs to do it.

61
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:21,601
<i>Not necessarily. </i>

62
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,634
Departments of diagnostic
medicine don't exist.

63
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,200
The only reason we have one
is because of House.

64
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,768
You reassigned us,

65
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,567
Kept us on payroll
for three months.

66
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:31,834
<i>You might as well
give me a chance. </i>

67
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,134
You're a great doctor.

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,501
<i>I want you to stay on
in neuro. </i>

69
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,300
But House was a genius.

70
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:41,000
House was an egotistical,
pill-Popping lawsuit magnet...

71
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,701
And a genius.

72
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:46,067
<i>And I worked with him longer
than anybody else. </i>

73
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:48,267
I can do this.

74
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,801
<i>You get one shot. </i>

75
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,401
What's House gonna do?

76
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,200
<i>No idea,
but he's gone. </i>

77
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,067
So how about we focus
on the medicine?

78
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:08,334
What?
You're the boss.

79
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:09,501
It's kind of sexy.

80
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,200
Here I thought
it was just the pants.

81
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,768
Uh, diabetic neuropathy?

82
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:16,534
Hba1c looks fine.

83
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:18,900
Could be hypothyroidism.

84
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,067
No fatigue
or weight gain.

85
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:21,868
What about complex
regional pain syndrome?

86
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,000
<i>That's a good idea. </i>

87
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:24,834
Let's run with it.
Look at that.

88
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,501
No House,
the job still gets done.

89
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:27,634
And yet something's
missing.

90
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:28,367
<i>I'm short.
He's black. </i>

91
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:30,134
You're gay-Ish.

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,401
That's it.
Treat for crps.

93
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:34,401
Prep the patient
for spinal stimulation.

94
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,401
I don't buy it.

95
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:41,100
Crps isn't that well
understood, but...

96
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,401
I think
it's mercury poisoning.

97
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,900
I eat a ton of sushi.

98
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,701
And you're currently getting
mixed reviews

99
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:47,933
<i>In speed-The-Plow
on broadway. </i>

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,200
Google it.

101
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,567
It's pretty hard
to consume enough fish

102
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:51,967
To give yourself
mercury poisoning,

103
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,933
And it doesn't usually present
solely with pain.

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,868
But it can.

105
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,367
<i>Check out
the atlantic medical journal. </i>

106
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:58,834
This guy came in
with burning pain

107
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,100
Caused by, uh,
"erythromelalgia"

108
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,534
Caused by mercury poisoning.

109
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:05,868
Who needs actual doctors
when you got the internet?

110
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,267
No offense,
but doctors make mistakes.

111
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,701
Medical errors
are up 30% this year.

112
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,734
You should check the rate
of patient error.

113
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:13,434
There's a ton
of information out there.

114
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:15,801
Why wouldn't I educate myself,
be my own advocate?

115
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,967
Crps came up
in my search too.

116
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,100
But I've never had
any skin discoloration,

117
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,567
<i>And my pain is sporadic
and not constant. </i>

118
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:25,534
It's got to be worth
one lousy blood test.

119
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,501
You know how House feels
about people touching his ball.

120
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,234
No. Chase refuses
to tell me.

121
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,868
Right.
My husband's gay. Witty.

122
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:10,967
I hear you're taking over
for House.

123
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,834
You're gonna be great.
Congratulations.

124
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,801
Not permanent.

125
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,100
Yet. Taub and Thirteen
cool with it?

126
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,734
<i>He's older than you. </i>

127
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,033
She's seen you naked.

128
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,434
Not like we haven't
been working together

129
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,768
For two years now.

130
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:26,134
Working with is different
than working for.

131
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:28,734
<i>You saw House. </i>

132
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:29,868
How was he?

133
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:30,967
<i>He was... </i>

134
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,200
Good.

135
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,734
<i>He was honest,
took responsibility. </i>

136
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,634
It was kind of weird.

137
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,601
<i>Uh, is Thirteen around?</i>

138
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,967
I need her to sign off
on her e. R. Transfer.

139
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,434
She and Taub are doing
a spinal stimulation.

140
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:45,467
No, they're not.

141
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,534
<i>I just dropped a patient</i>

142
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,467
In the cath suite,
and your guys were not in there.

143
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:56,933
You know,
usually spinal stimulation

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,601
Is done with the patient
in the room.

145
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,801
He asked us to test his blood
for mercury.

146
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:02,834
It's unlikely,
but not impossible.

147
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,567
<i>It's also not what we agreed
on. Testing doesn't hurt. </i>

148
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,667
It only takes 20 minutes.
I figured it didn't matter.

149
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:07,801
<i>I'm thinking</i>

150
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:09,334
I should decide
when it matters.

151
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,334
<i>When you're done</i>

152
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:11,300
<i>Marking your territory... </i>

153
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,467
Test results.

154
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,933
<i>Surprise, surprise. </i>

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,167
Marcus webly was wrong.

156
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:19,667
I'll handle this.

157
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,834
You expected
not to have mixed feelings?

158
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:31,000
I know it's the right call.

159
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,834
Just don't know what to do
with my time.

160
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,967
And my leg...

161
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,100
Pain's flared up

162
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,567
<i>Since I left mayfield. </i>

163
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:39,200
<i>Ibuprofen's barely putting
a dent in it. </i>

164
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:41,734
<i>You need a hobby.
Right. </i>

165
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:43,467
Doctors the world over
treat chronic pain

166
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:44,900
With collections
of hummel figurines.

167
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,167
<i>No, I didn't say
you need a lame hobby. </i>

168
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:49,768
You need something
to keep you engaged,

169
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:50,834
<i>Connected
to other people. </i>

170
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,868
You already made me
get a roommate.

171
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,167
Wilson's got one bedroom.

172
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,467
I don't think we can get
any more connected

173
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:56,734
Without unzipping.

174
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:57,768
Okay.

175
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:00,267
So what does Wilson
like to do?

176
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:07,567
Vince, I'm dr. Foreman,
head of diagnostics.

177
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,768
So you must be
the genius' replacement.

178
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,667
I prefer to think of myself
as genius 2.0.

179
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,334
Your blood tests ruled out
mercury poisoning.

180
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:16,200
<i>What was my mercury level?
2.8.</i>

181
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:18,100
<i>That means for every deciliter
of... I know what it means. </i>

182
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,501
I also know
it's above normal.

183
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,401
I want mercury chelation.

184
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,134
Your level
isn't elevated enough

185
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,734
To produce your symptoms.

186
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,067
You can't know that
until we de-elevate it

187
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:27,300
And see if my pain improves.

188
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,900
<i>It's a judgment call. </i>

189
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,967
Based on ten years
of medical training?

190
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,834
<i>I think you have crps. </i>

191
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,868
I want to try
spinal stimulation.

192
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,601
So, basically, you want
to shove a needle in my spine

193
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,134
Based on a glorified hunch.

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,300
I'll stick
with the chelation.

195
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:46,167
If you don't want to get better,
I think we're done.

196
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:49,334
What do you mean "done"?

197
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,401
You're not interested
in my medical opinion.

198
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,000
<i>I'll move on
to my next patient. </i>

199
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:54,501
You'll move on to a doctor
willing to run

200
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,634
All the unnecessary tests
and procedures you want.

201
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:59,434
Or you can stick around
and be cured.

202
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,000
Makes no difference to me.

203
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:07,734
I'm glad you changed your mind.

204
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,300
Don't know about that.

205
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,501
Dr. Foreman basically
strong-Armed me,

206
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:14,601
Which is impressive.

207
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,267
Stimulating at 100 hertz.

208
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,000
<i>Guess you found him</i>

209
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,900
A little more persuasive
than two of us...

210
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,768
Probably the pants.

211
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,367
He reminds me of me.

212
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:27,634
Is it supposed to hurt?
Not if we're in correctly.

213
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,501
Is it your hands?
Your back?

214
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,167
No, my chest.

215
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,234
Can't breathe.

216
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,534
Heart rate's 140,
climbing.

217
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,868
You need to hold still.

218
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:39,801
What did you do?

219
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:42,267
Deep breaths.

220
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,300
His lungs
are filling with fluid.

221
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:50,300
Analysis of the fluid
from Vince's lungs

222
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,567
Shows the lung problem
is really a heart problem.

223
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,467
He's got a thickened
left ventricle.

224
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:56,134
When his heart sped up
during the procedure,

225
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,234
It jacked up the pressure
in his lungs,

226
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,967
Causing pulmonary edema.

227
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,034
Good thing I talked the patient
into spinal stimulation.

228
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:03,700
<i>It did lead us
to discovering a new symptom</i>

229
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,567
And proved he was wrong
about mercury poisoning.

230
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:09,268
We lucked into that discovery,
and we were wrong about crps.

231
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:12,500
Ventricular thickening
plus neuropathy

232
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,667
Could equal lyme disease.
Not without joint pain.

233
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,101
When is his new game
coming out?

234
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:17,667
Couple months.

235
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,034
<i>He's probably working
nonstop. </i>

236
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:20,634
Might be using more than coffee
to power through.

237
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,533
Cocaine use
explains the symptoms.

238
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
So we search his office
for drugs.

239
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,867
<i>No. </i>

240
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,467
We're gonna ask him.

241
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,101
In a lot of ways,
cooking is like music.

242
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:39,268
Different elements combine
to make a symphony.

243
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:41,067
<i>Difference is
that beethoven's 5th</i>

244
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,834
Isn't gonna be poop
tomorrow.

245
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,667
What was my one condition
for allowing you

246
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:48,533
To tag along?
Try not to be a jerk.

247
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,700
I'm trying.
I'm just failing.

248
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:54,234
Roll your meatballs
and keep an open mind.

249
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:00,901
How hard are you trying not
to make a ball joke right now?

250
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,533
They're smoking.

251
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,433
Your balls.
Oh!

252
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,034
Ow. No, no.

253
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,400
They're browning
way too fast.

254
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:10,967
Blue is the color
you got to watch out for.

255
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:12,834
Enough.

256
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:15,667
My god, they're...
They're still raw inside.

257
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,967
<i>By the time
they're cooked through,</i>

258
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:18,234
<i>The outside
will be burned. </i>

259
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:20,001
I think there's
a medicated powder for that.

260
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:25,800
Although vinegar could work.

261
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:29,001
My o-chem prof talked
about how, theoretically,

262
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:32,034
You shouldn't trust the results
of a hemoglobin a1c test

263
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,034
On a chronically acidotic
patient.

264
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:36,734
The acid in the blood
slows the reaction

265
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,901
Between the hemoglobin protein
and blood sugar.

266
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,901
<i>Browning meat is the same
chemical process,</i>

267
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:44,667
Which means, it should also
be slowed by acid.

268
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:48,567
That actually
makes sense.

269
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,201
You might've...
saved my balls.

270
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:54,634
That's the spirit.

271
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,234
Obviously, the procedure
didn't go as planned.

272
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:58,567
<i>The heart problem
was unforeseeable,</i>

273
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,034
<i>But I still feel
responsible. </i>

274
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,167
<i>I'm sorry.
Okay. </i>

275
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:03,634
How long you guys
been doing it?

276
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:08,234
<i>I think it's best
if we kept things professional. </i>

277
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:11,901
<i>Tough to do now that I've seen
you rock a leopard-print bikini. </i>

278
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13,467
Congrats, by the way.
Up top.

279
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:16,734
You hacked
my profile page?

280
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,433
<i>Your treatment nearly gave me
a heart attack. </i>

281
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,834
Figured I'd check
if you had the credentials

282
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,067
To go with the cojones.

283
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,967
<i>One search led to another. </i>

284
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:24,533
Is there a shot of just her?
I'm thinking screen saver.

285
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,467
We need to know
if you've been using cocaine.

286
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,368
Nope. Dude, you just block
everybody,

287
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,901
Or do you really only have
three friends?

288
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,400
We need you
to be straight with us.

289
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,600
We need to be able
to trust you.

290
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,467
I cleaned up my act
12 years ago...

291
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:40,600
After my
college roommate o. D.'D.

292
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:44,301
Okay.

293
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,767
Search his office.

294
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:55,400
You think he was lying?
No. But I'm not sure.

295
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,800
It was worth asking.

296
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,533
If he'd have said yes,
it would've saved us a trip.

297
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,334
But he didn't.

298
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,268
You have to forget
about him.

299
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,334
The patient?
House.

300
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,467
First, you try acting like him.
That doesn't work.

301
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:09,167
So then you try
the opposite.

302
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:12,334
Now you're mad because you have
to use his move.

303
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,634
I feel like
tom brady's backup.

304
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,400
Tom brady's backup
now makes $10 million.

305
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,301
Stop comparing.

306
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:21,667
You can do this
by being you.

307
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,201
We should still check out
his office,

308
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:24,800
Talk to his coworkers.

309
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,001
I'll get Taub.

310
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,268
And...

311
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,934
Thanks.

312
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:32,268
Oh, and dinner tonight
at 7:00.

313
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,001
Can we make it 8:00?

314
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,167
Already made a reservation
for 7:00.

315
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:43,567
Hi.
I'm making gnocchi.

316
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:50,034
Oh, I didn't mean
to intrude.

317
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:53,268
I just... Cecile's in my cooking class.

318
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:56,567
She doesn't speak english.

319
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,368
<i>If you bake the potatoes</i>

320
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,334
Instead of boiling them,
it's less moisture,

321
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,500
<i>Fewer gluten bonds,
lighter gnocchi. </i>

322
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,967
<i>You seem good.
Feeling better. </i>

323
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:20,067
House, I need to talk to you
about your leaving the hospital.

324
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:21,301
<i>I do love
a good groveling,</i>

325
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:23,034
<i>But my decision is final.
That's fine</i>

326
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:25,533
As long
as I'm not the reason for it.

327
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,268
I know that sounds
completely narcissistic, but...

328
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:28,901
<i>Yeah. </i>

329
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:31,600
But it's not.

330
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,433
<i>We flirted.
We kissed. </i>

331
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,400
I fondled.

332
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,767
I hallucinated
a night with you

333
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:39,301
And yelled it
from a hospital balcony.

334
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:40,767
You're not a narcissist.

335
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,667
So what am I?

336
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:46,234
Not the reason I'm leaving.

337
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,433
House...

338
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:54,201
I'm gonna miss you.

339
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,834
Lady, either kiss him
or leave.

340
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:00,234
We got work to do.

341
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:02,167
You just couldn't keep
your trap shut.

342
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:03,467
Make the damn gnocchi.

343
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,533
Bye.

344
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,467
I guess you're not in a hurry
to get back to the office.

345
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,934
And you are?

346
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,467
I'm not trying to avoid
my boyfriend.

347
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,467
I'm a lizard.
Not an idiot.

348
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,901
You've been in a crappy mood
since we got in the car.

349
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:33,301
And you're completely okay
with being ordered around

350
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:37,767
By someone who 24 hours ago
was basically your equal?

351
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:39,433
Unlike you, I didn't expect
anything different.

352
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,368
The work part,
I can get used to.

353
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,368
He didn't ask me
to go to dinner.

354
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,600
He told me we were going.

355
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,934
He's never
done that before.

356
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:51,034
So even the score.

357
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,433
<i>Go home tonight,</i>

358
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,567
Put on some heels,
and break him like a pony.

359
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:56,167
You'll feel much better.

360
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:59,067
What?

361
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:00,101
Wow, that's one

362
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,667
Big-Ass bird.

363
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,567
Wow.

364
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:12,967
It's kind of amazing.

365
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:15,167
The way the wings move,
it's so real.

366
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,301
Get them off me!

367
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,667
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

368
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,967
I'm going to call
Foreman.

369
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,901
Little help.

370
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,301
<i>Your partner said</i>

371
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,167
You studied birds
to improve the game animation.

372
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,368
Did you touch them?

373
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:31,734
Can't dissect
without touching.

374
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,433
It's the best way
to understand the anatomy.

375
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,934
It's also a good way
to contract an infection

376
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:36,101
Called psittacosis.

377
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,234
We spoke to dr. Foreman.

378
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:38,734
He wants to start you
on antibiotics.

379
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,600
Does that infection
cause problems in the...

380
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,067
Joystick area?

381
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:44,567
<i>I'm kind of stuck
in play mode. </i>

382
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:47,368
Yes, we get it.
She's very, very pretty.

383
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,234
<i>It's not her. </i>

384
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,867
I mean, it was...

385
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,533
When she was here with her
boyfriend three hours ago.

386
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,301
You've had an erection
for three hours?

387
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,734
<i>At first,
it was just embarrassing,</i>

388
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,667
<i>But now it's really starting
to hurt. </i>

389
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:01,034
Will the antibiotics help?

390
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:03,901
I'm afraid not.
This isn't psittacosis.

391
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,734
His erection persisted
even with medication.

392
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,267
<i>We had to put in a surgical
shunt just to drain the blood. </i>

393
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:12,634
<i>You missed dinner. </i>

394
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,801
And a shunt doesn't require
both of you.

395
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,001
I'm dedicated.

396
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:17,233
<i>So the holy trinity:</i>

397
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,634
Heart, hands, hose.

398
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:19,734
<i>Could be Guillain-Barre. </i>

399
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,934
Not with normal
nerve conduction.

400
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,601
Thrombocytosis.

401
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,534
His platelet count
isn't that high.

402
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:26,968
Brain tumor
makes more sense.

403
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,667
I'm sorry.
I just realized...

404
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:34,300
Joint pain and joint pain.

405
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,467
Honest, I wasn't laughing
because of the obvious tension

406
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,167
<i>Between the two of you. </i>

407
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:42,801
Erection points
to a circulatory problem.

408
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,133
I'm with Foreman.

409
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,467
It is possible
for a brain tumor to cause...

410
00:18:45,534 --> 00:18:47,434
We're going
with thrombocytosis.

411
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,667
Okay.

412
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,801
<i>You're mad I didn't ask you
to dinner?</i>

413
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,200
How long
have we been dating?

414
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:57,500
It felt like an order.

415
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,300
Your tone of voice was...
My tone?

416
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,801
I'm under a little pressure
right now.

417
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,133
How about giving me
a break?

418
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,634
Look, this is tough
for both of us,

419
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:05,867
Except I haven't just gotten
a promotion.

420
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:07,467
So now you're jealous.

421
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:09,500
No. I'm just saying
don't complain

422
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,133
About the burdens of command
to your employees.

423
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,968
I was complaining
to my girlfriend.

424
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:16,801
<i>Who are those guys?</i>

425
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,701
I have no idea.

426
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,200
Meet the competition.

427
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:27,968
Steve Paulson.
Neurology, st. Mark's.

428
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,834
Nice to meet you.

429
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:31,701
<i>You called another doctor?
Lots of other doctors. </i>

430
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,034
Posted my symptoms
on the internet.

431
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,434
You guys are 0 for 2.

432
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,001
I thought I'd look
for some backup.

433
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,968
I can cure all your symptoms
with my papaya toxin cleanse.

434
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:40,734
Month's supply, $395.

435
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:43,867
Okay, that guy's an idiot.
That doesn't mean they all are.

436
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,834
Neither one of you have
privileges at this hospital.

437
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,034
Please leave...

438
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,200
Now.

439
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:51,968
<i>Uh, dr. Foreman,
sorry for the intrusion,</i>

440
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,534
But, um, I noticed
you haven't done a head MRI yet.

441
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,734
'Cause he doesn't
need one.

442
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,133
I'm pretty sure
he's got a brain tumor.

443
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,068
<i>We considered that</i>

444
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,601
And concluded thrombocytosis
is more likely.

445
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm starting him
on hydroxyurea.

446
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,667
His platelets don't seem
anywhere near high enough.

447
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:06,233
<i>If you took an image,
I'm sure you'll... </i>

448
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,968
There are no signs
of increased ICP.

449
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:09,167
<i>I'm not delaying treatment. </i>

450
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,567
Looks like we need
a tiebreaker.

451
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:13,133
Dr. Hadley,
what do you think?

452
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,834
I think both theories
have merit.

453
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:17,567
So brain tumor,

454
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,200
<i>Otherwise you'd back
your boss/boyfriend. </i>

455
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,634
I want an MRI.

456
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:27,367
Fine.
I'll set it up.

457
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,767
Great. You're up.
I need a taster.

458
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:40,367
<i>Ragout with pork sausage,</i>

459
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:43,601
Beef thigh, no cream.

460
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:47,300
It's a little early.

461
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:56,167
Did you even go to bed
last night?

462
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,901
Bed is for sissies,

463
00:20:57,968 --> 00:21:00,534
Unless you're having sex,
in which case...

464
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:02,500
No, bed is still
for sissies.

465
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:05,634
Doesn't this seem
a little bit obsessive?

466
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,534
Should've been here
when I was butchering the ox.

467
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,001
<i>What do you expect?
I'm an addict. </i>

468
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,667
I turn everything up
to eleven.

469
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:13,500
Yeah. I thought you were trying
to tone that down.

470
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,467
No. I was trying to find
something I could set at eleven

471
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:16,767
Without blowing out
my eardrums.

472
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:18,767
Star anise
with caramelized onions.

473
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:21,701
The sulfur compounds
bring out the meat flavor.

474
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,200
I couldn't sleep
because of my leg.

475
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:28,634
It was either make ragout

476
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:30,767
Or go out on the street
looking to score.

477
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:36,867
<i>Good choice. </i>

478
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:39,534
So, so good.

479
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,567
He asked me a question.
I answered.

480
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:51,601
You told me
to make my own decisions.

481
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:52,968
I do, and you stab me
in the back.

482
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:54,334
<i>I didn't even say
what I really thought. </i>

483
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I hedged, and I don't like
that I hedged.

484
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:57,867
If I have
a legitimate opinion...

485
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,500
<i>Express it
in private. </i>

486
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,767
In public, the team opinion
is your opinion.

487
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:04,167
<i>Except the team opinion
is your opinion. </i>

488
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:05,767
That's my job.

489
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:07,034
<i>And what's mine,</i>

490
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,001
To lie when I'm asked
a direct question?

491
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:12,233
You would've done it
for House.

492
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,467
<i>Maybe you just don't want me
to succeed. </i>

493
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,934
Maybe you just want
to kick me again

494
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,601
<i>For not asking you
to dinner. </i>

495
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,801
At least when House
was being an unbelievable jerk,

496
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:23,267
I could talk
to my boyfriend about it.

497
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:24,801
<i>I may be a jerk,</i>

498
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:26,200
But you're wrong.

499
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:28,767
Mri is clean.

500
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:30,768
That rules out thrombocytosis.

501
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,601
You're early.

502
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,434
<i>For what?</i>

503
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,133
I knew you'd show up here
complaining about Foreman.

504
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,034
<i>Thought you'd hold out
for another week at least. </i>

505
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,367
I showed up to ask
if you've seen thrombocytosis

506
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,167
With a platelet count
under...

507
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,634
I went crazy,
not stupid.

508
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:53,834
I leave,

509
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:56,133
Foreman embraces
his inner mugabe.

510
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,834
What's that?

511
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:00,167
<i>Embryonali...
Unhatched chicken egg. </i>

512
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:03,034
I'm gonna suck out
some of the yolk

513
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,634
And replace it with ragout.

514
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:07,233
By the way, you can tell
the other lepers

515
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,801
That their absence
has been noted.

516
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,634
Cameron didn't come by?

517
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:13,734
Daddy's little co-Dependent
is all grown up.

518
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,167
Making room
for daddy's hot bisexual

519
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,567
<i>With boyfriend problems. </i>

520
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:21,968
It's not a problem.
It's, um...

521
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,500
Okay.
It's a problem.

522
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,200
I mean, I get it.
The patient's a nightmare.

523
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:29,968
He posted his case online.
It... You know Foreman.

524
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,701
You know the situation.

525
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,367
<i>How can I get him
to tone it down?</i>

526
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:35,901
<i>Stop being a coward
for one thing. </i>

527
00:23:35,968 --> 00:23:37,300
He's the one who's afraid
of failure.

528
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:38,534
<i>At a job that no one before me
has ever done. </i>

529
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:41,100
His fears are justified.

530
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,034
You're just afraid
of giving him control over you,

531
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,567
<i>Which might work at home. </i>

532
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:46,534
It makes it almost impossible
for him to do his job.

533
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:49,601
Pass me
those crackers.

534
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:52,133
You're saying
this is all my fault?

535
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,267
I'm saying...

536
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:55,968
<i>That you would be happier</i>

537
00:23:56,034 --> 00:24:00,100
If you learned
when it's okay to give in.

538
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,133
<i>What?</i>

539
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,500
You just suggested
that I give in

540
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,133
So that I can be happy.

541
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,300
What did they do to you
in there?

542
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,901
Taste this.

543
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,167
<i>Mmm. Good. </i>

544
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,500
This might be the best thing
I've ever eaten.

545
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,400
And, yes, I'm including
what you're thinking of now.

546
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:35,267
You are an amazing cook!

547
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:38,834
I know.

548
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:42,801
And yet, my leg hurts.

549
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:44,567
Fire her.

550
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:46,034
I'm not gonna fire her.

551
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,167
Then stop being
such a wuss.

552
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:48,367
I'm not being a wuss.

553
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,534
Challenging you
is part of her job.

554
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:52,334
But when she does it,
you take it personally.

555
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,968
So you're saying
this is my fault?

556
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:57,500
I was trying to bury it
a little, but, yeah.

557
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:58,968
You got to eliminate
either the challenge

558
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,334
Or the reaction.

559
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,867
Or we could stick
with my original plan.

560
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,867
We get drunk and talk
about how girls are lame.

561
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:07,434
Yeah.

562
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,901
This problem will go away
on its own.

563
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,400
It's 8:00
in the morning.

564
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:22,801
Coffee ice cream.

565
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,968
<i>No frittata?
No bombolini?</i>

566
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:27,334
Started thinking
about what you said,

567
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,634
About me obsessing.

568
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,601
Started obsessing
about obsessing.

569
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,434
Decided to take a day off.

570
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
You were enjoying cooking.

571
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:38,801
How like a man to think that
I enjoy slaving over a hot stove all day

572
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,500
While you're off
banging secretaries.

573
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,233
You said it was keeping
your mind off the pain.

574
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,133
<i>That was before I discovered
the biggest loser marathon</i>

575
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,500
On cable.

576
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,367
I like to pretend
they can see me eating.

577
00:25:49,434 --> 00:25:51,801
And your leg?

578
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,367
It's fine.

579
00:25:57,934 --> 00:26:00,567
My leg's killing me.

580
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:02,133
Cooking helped for a while.

581
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,667
I guess I got bored.

582
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:05,167
My leg
started hurting again.

583
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:07,400
Then I got worried,
and that made the pain worse.

584
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,001
What are you worried about?

585
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,001
That nothing's gonna help.

586
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:14,634
<i>That I end up
in the very dark place. </i>

587
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:19,367
I'm fine...

588
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:20,968
Just not happy.

589
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:22,400
<i>I didn't let you out
because you were happy. </i>

590
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:23,667
I let you out,
because I believe

591
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:24,968
You had the skills
to cope with that.

592
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:28,200
<i>You tried one thing.
It didn't work. </i>

593
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:30,467
So move on.

594
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:32,701
<i>Write. Play chess.
- What if nothing works?</i>

595
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,233
<i>What if nothing
gives me more</i>

596
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,867
Than a few days before my brain
starts looking for the next fix,

597
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:39,834
Before my leg feels like
someone's shoving nails into it?

598
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:41,634
What do I do then?

599
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:45,334
If nothing in the world
can hold your interest,

600
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,901
Uh, we'll deal with that
when we get to it.

601
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:51,867
<i>But you have to trust me,
and you have to be patient. </i>

602
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,334
I brought you a doughnut.

603
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,133
The florist was closed.

604
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,434
I'll get a vase
and put it in water.

605
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:12,701
You know
I'm sorry, right?

606
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:16,001
I'm sorry too.

607
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:19,434
Do you think, um...

608
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
We could start over?

609
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,500
That's a fantastic idea.

610
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,634
We're gonna be late.

611
00:27:30,701 --> 00:27:33,267
Your boss won't mind.

612
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:38,634
No way.

613
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:42,901
His lymph nodes blew up.

614
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:44,601
He's been treated
for thrombocytosis,

615
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:45,934
<i>But there's been
no change. </i>

616
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:48,667
<i>I was wrong.
God, you are a genius. </i>

617
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:49,634
<i>I'm adding this to my list
of symptoms. </i>

618
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,567
That didn't work
last time.

619
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:54,628
Because I didn't think big enough.
Now I offer $25000 reward.

620
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,267
Steroids reduced
his facial swelling.

621
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,634
Swollen lymph nodes
rule out thrombocytosis.

622
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:51,334
How did so many people
get my personal email?

623
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,467
The internet
is a magical place.

624
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:58,434
<i>Lymph enlargement
makes me think polyarteritis... </i>

625
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,167
You were saying?

626
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:04,400
No point in treating the symptom
and not the disease.

627
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,734
Your stunt generated
quite a few responses.

628
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:08,834
Let's take a look.

629
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:10,200
I'm way ahead of you.

630
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:12,100
Paraneoplastic syndrome
secondary to spinal tumor.

631
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,934
No. No hypercalcemia.

632
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,667
No muscle spasms
or incontinence.

633
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:17,834
You are possessed
by the biblical demon "legion. "

634
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:19,934
No, no jumping off a cliff
in a herd of pigs.

635
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:21,034
Otherwise it did fit.

636
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,100
Graves' disease.

637
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,667
No. Thyroid levels
are normal.

638
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:25,634
You want us to spend
the next few days shooting down

639
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:27,434
Every theory in the world,
or can we do our jobs

640
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,667
And come up
with one that works?

641
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,834
I want you to test me
for amyloidosis.

642
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:32,701
That your professional
opinion?

643
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,200
<i>It's the wisdom of crowds. </i>

644
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:36,233
Studies show the collective
decision of a group

645
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,934
Can be more accurate
than any individual's decision.

646
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:41,100
I went through my emails.
Amyloidosis got the most votes.

647
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,901
If you had amyloidosis,

648
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:45,200
There'd be speckling
on your cardiac ultrasound.

649
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:47,834
In 100% of cases?

650
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,601
Fine.

651
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,133
I'll make you a deal.

652
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
We'll do a kidney biopsy
to test for amyloidosis.

653
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:54,634
When it comes back negative,

654
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:57,200
<i>You pull your case off of the internet
and retract the reward. </i>

655
00:29:57,267 --> 00:30:00,667
It's either that,
or I don't test you at all.

656
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:02,767
Deal.

657
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:16,068
If you wanted a quickie,
you should've called ahead.

658
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:18,434
I'm a mess.

659
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,068
Came home for lunch.

660
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:22,434
You have lunch with Cuddy
on tuesdays.

661
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,601
She was busy.

662
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,200
And you are checking up
on me.

663
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,567
You know,
you can talk to me.

664
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:32,068
<i>Is that my laundry?</i>

665
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:35,467
You were running out of socks
for me to borrow.

666
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,200
You got plenty
of underwear, though.

667
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:39,867
I'm fine.

668
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:41,200
You said that
this morning.

669
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:44,434
And consistency
proves what?

670
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,467
Really. I'm good.
I'll put these in your room.

671
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:51,267
* you always hurt *

672
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:53,701
* the one you love *

673
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:03,567
<i>Biopsy showed deposits
in the renal endothelium</i>

674
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:06,233
Consistent with amyloidosis.

675
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,467
The internet was right.

676
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,334
Start him
on dexamethasone.

677
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,767
<i>Already done. </i>

678
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,300
<i>This may not be
the best time for this... </i>

679
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:17,133
But I quit.

680
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,601
I got an offer to join
a friend's surgical practice.

681
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:23,500
<i>Um, you don't generally get an offer
unless you're looking for one. </i>

682
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:26,968
I put out some feelers when I found
out House wasn't coming back.

683
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:28,634
I lobbied to keep
the department open

684
00:31:28,701 --> 00:31:30,034
So you could keep
your job.

685
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,334
Yes. That was incredibly
altruistic of you.

686
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:40,034
It's nothing personal.

687
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,367
Actually, I think
you're doing pretty well.

688
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:47,467
But I came here to work
with House.

689
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,100
He's a jerk.

690
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,901
We'll be fine
without him.

691
00:31:57,968 --> 00:31:59,767
Do you know how many resumes
we get every day

692
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,534
Without even asking?

693
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:04,634
Might be a few less
after Cuddy shuts us down.

694
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:07,601
The case got solved
under your watch.

695
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:11,367
Does it really matter
how it happened?

696
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:13,934
It matters.

697
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,968
What if I'm just not ready
for this job?

698
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,867
Okay, you're sad.

699
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:27,233
I could tell you the story
about me and my roommate

700
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,467
At Sarah Lawrence.

701
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,300
Okay.

702
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:36,467
Her name was lindsey,

703
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:40,334
And she was a cheerleader
from iowa.

704
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:44,867
I broke my toilet
this morning.

705
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:49,068
I'll get my tools.

706
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,334
I blocked the intake valve

707
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,734
So I could collect
some of House's urine.

708
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:54,467
<i>Cuddy,
he was barely limping. </i>

709
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:55,934
What did the lab say?

710
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,267
<i>The urine was clean
for vicodin. </i>

711
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:58,367
<i>It did, however,</i>

712
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,901
Contain strange
epithelial cells.

713
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:04,734
Further analysis showed they were
from a labrador retriever.

714
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:08,167
Damn.

715
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,968
He's using.

716
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,834
No. No.

717
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:47,367
Vince. Vince.

718
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:49,934
Vince, relax.

719
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,601
It's dr. Foreman.

720
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Kill it!

721
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,200
Kill it!
No! No!

722
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:22,934
I don't have my blaster!

723
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,600
He's hallucinating 'cause he's burning up.
Amyloidosis wouldn't do this.

724
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:34,434
<i>The antipyretics didn't work. </i>

725
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:38,401
Hopefully the cold tub
will get his temp down.

726
00:35:38,968 --> 00:35:41,001
Maybe we should see
if anyone's sent in other ideas.

727
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,767
Maybe the reward money
attract...

728
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:44,567
No. I'm not letting
anyone else jerk us around.

729
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:46,467
The masses were wrong
about amyloidosis.

730
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:48,233
They don't know
about the fever.

731
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,834
I'm going with light-Chain
deposition disorder.

732
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:54,001
You okay with that?

733
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,133
Yes.

734
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,701
<i>We think you have a disease
called LCDD.</i>

735
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,968
It causes protein
to build up in your organs.

736
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,701
You think?

737
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:14,367
We can't definitely confirm
the diagnosis.

738
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:16,867
<i>And our only chance
of beating this</i>

739
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,334
Would be to start you
on high-Dose chemotherapy.

740
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,834
<i>But I do have to warn you</i>

741
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:23,601
<i>That in your condition,
it might kill you. </i>

742
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,867
Do you want me to get you
some more information?

743
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:32,934
You're my doctor.

744
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:34,734
I trust you.

745
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:37,601
No, you don't.

746
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:41,968
<i>You're scared, and you don't
want to make this decision. </i>

747
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:52,200
My career is riding
on this case...

748
00:36:52,267 --> 00:36:53,801
<i>Nowhere near as important</i>

749
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:57,233
As your life.

750
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,367
But I think the best shot
for both of us

751
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:03,601
<i>Is to treat for LCDD.</i>

752
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,100
Okay.

753
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,034
<i>All right, let's get you
out of this tub</i>

754
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,601
<i>And into chemo. </i>

755
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:18,367
<i>We know you're back
on vicodin. </i>

756
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:20,434
No. The only thing you know
is that I'm a genius

757
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,601
Who got a dog
to pee in your toilet.

758
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,467
You don't know how I did it
or, more interestingly,

759
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,801
Where I peed.

760
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:28,867
House, you've spent the last
three months...

761
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:30,567
<i>Et tu, Butte?</i>

762
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:31,734
You got no reason
to be here.

763
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:33,001
He's the one
I was jerking around.

764
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:34,068
<i>Why is your leg better?</i>

765
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:35,701
Ow. It hurts.

766
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:37,567
<i>Please go away now. </i>

767
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:38,801
<i>If you really think
I'm using,</i>

768
00:37:38,867 --> 00:37:40,167
How about asking me
before taking a wrench

769
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:41,167
To your plumbing?

770
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:42,534
House, you're an addict.

771
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:44,367
You can't be surprised
if we can't take you

772
00:37:44,434 --> 00:37:45,601
<i>At your word. </i>

773
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,200
Fine. Let's get you
some proof.

774
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,434
Hide your eyes, ladies.

775
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,734
House.

776
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:53,634
You too.

777
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,300
My godson
made me that mug.

778
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,334
<i>If the lab says
that this is retriever too,</i>

779
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,634
Please let me know
right away.

780
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:05,068
It'd explain
my overwhelming desire

781
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,400
To wipe my butt
on your carpet.

782
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:12,601
Thank you for dragging me
into this.

783
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:35,001
Stop the chemo.
He's got fabry's disease.

784
00:38:35,068 --> 00:38:36,334
He was in the tub
for an hour.

785
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,133
His fingers should have pruned,
but they didn't.

786
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,767
Already stopped chemo
and confirmed fabry's.

787
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,667
<i>I'm glad you both agree,</i>

788
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:45,100
But could somebody
loop me in here?

789
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,601
We assumed the deposits
in your kidneys were proteins,

790
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:49,767
<i>But they were fats. </i>

791
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:50,934
<i>Fabry's makes them build up</i>

792
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:52,934
In your organs,
choke your nerves,

793
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:55,434
Keep your fingers
from pruning in water.

794
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,200
It's chronic
but manageable.

795
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:58,200
How'd you figure it out?

796
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,267
lodine mumps.

797
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,767
His lymph nodes swelled up
after the head c. T.

798
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:10,068
We thought it was a new symptom,
but it wasn't.

799
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,734
It was a reaction
to the contrast.

800
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:13,968
lodine mumps takes lymph nodes
off the table.

801
00:39:14,034 --> 00:39:16,367
Remove that symptom...

802
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:18,667
And that just came to you?

803
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:23,534
I looked through
the online responses again.

804
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:25,968
Someone posted it
this morning.

805
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,133
Heard Cuddy made it official.

806
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,667
<i>Department's yours.
Congrats. </i>

807
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,734
I'm sorry.

808
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:52,801
I went behind your back.

809
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:56,500
<i>On a scale of 1 to 10,
how mad are you?</i>

810
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:58,133
A 7.

811
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,367
And that's stupid.

812
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:03,367
You did the right thing.

813
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,133
It's my fault you thought
you had to go behind my back.

814
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,767
I should've stood up
to you.

815
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:08,634
But you didn't 'cause
you didn't want to fight again.

816
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,667
It's our first case.
It'll take time to adjust.

817
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:23,100
What if by the time we get adjusted,
we don't like each other anymore?

818
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:25,100
That's not gonna happen.

819
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:26,500
You sure?

820
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:29,367
'Cause ever since I took this job,
we've been making each other miserable.

821
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:37,400
I really don't think
this is gonna work.

822
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,934
You're breaking up
with me?

823
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:46,133
No.

824
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,701
The other night when I thought
I was done, you were there.

825
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:52,567
I need you.

826
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,300
I don't want
to lose you.

827
00:40:58,701 --> 00:41:01,001
Why are you...?

828
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,634
You're firing me.

829
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:16,467
I'm sorry.

830
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:24,500
I slipped.

831
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,267
You took vicodin?

832
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,834
$25,000.

833
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:39,667
I solved
my old team's case.

834
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:41,834
<i>I was about
to take the pills. </i>

835
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:43,100
I went online.

836
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,001
I found people posting
medical problems,

837
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:47,068
And...

838
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:50,701
My leg stopped hurting.

839
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:54,534
Oh.

840
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:58,034
Oh?

841
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,834
I'm supposed
to be changing my life.

842
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:00,968
<i>This is not a change. </i>

843
00:42:01,034 --> 00:42:02,434
Well, maybe I was wrong.

844
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,867
Says the guy making sand castles
in my brain.

845
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:07,334
We need to keep you
from using.

846
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,068
Taking your job away,
the medical puzzles,

847
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:11,034
<i>Nearly drove you
back to it. </i>

848
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,467
Maybe diagnostic medicine

849
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,534
Is the key
to keeping you clean.

850
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:21,734
So you're okay with me
going online, solving cases?

851
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:26,267
No. You can't sit all day
in a room by yourself.

852
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:28,968
<i>Isolation
fosters depression. </i>

853
00:42:29,034 --> 00:42:30,767
The hospital is part
of my old life.

854
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:33,634
<i>If I go back,
I might become... </i>

855
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:36,267
Who I was before,
pills and all.

856
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,701
<i>That's a possibility. </i>

857
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:40,434
But could be...

858
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,701
The only thing worse for you
than going back to diagnostic medicine

859
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:46,901
Is not going back.

860
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:00,534
Guess we're gonna find out.
