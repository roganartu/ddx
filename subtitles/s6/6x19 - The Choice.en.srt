Aphasia and syncope.

He can't speak.

88
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,857
"Aphasia" is Greek
for loss of voice.

89
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:26,626
We've ruled out infection,
vocal cord damage, and stroke.

90
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:30,230
A lot of guys syncope at the altar.

91
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:32,132
It's Greek for "having the vapors."

92
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,500
We ruled out all the
common causes of fainting:

93
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:34,935
Low blood pressure, hypoglycemia,

94
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,903
dehydratio

95
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,939
don't say "ah."

96
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:44,511

97
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,915

lift up your gown.

98
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,017

100
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,988

102
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,024

103
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,860
I-I can--I can talk.

104
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,562

105
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,398

107
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,503
I know he wasn't faking.

108
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,772
Well, if she's buying that,
she might just be a keeper.

109
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,608
What about the syncope?

110
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:15,942
Well, the--

111
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:19,145
is she buying this too?

112
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,581
Why would he fake anything?

113
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,817
<i>Kryo podia.</i>

114
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,186
It's Greek for "duh."

115
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,888
Still, you get to keep
the engagement ring.

116
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:34,361
I don't think he was faking.

117
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,896
That's because you're
more gullible than I am.

118
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,865
For instance, I don't believe

119
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,533
that you called off
your open marriage.

120
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:41,868
I believe your wife called it off,

121
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:43,503
and you called off telling her

122
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,538
that you weren't calling it off.

123
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,607
A guy doesn't just throw a
golden ticket in the trash.

124
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,175
The same way a guy doesn't give up

125
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,378
a lucrative medical practice
to come work for you?

126
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,747
That's exactly why you dabble.

127
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,815
You're compensating for
your professional conquests

128
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,083
with sexual ones.

129
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,385
I'm not that predictable.

130
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,553
For example, you're
probably not expecting me

131
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,122
to ask you out for dinner tonight.

132
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,890
No, thanks.

133
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,991
You won't even consider it?

134
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,160
I did, just very quickly.

135
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,829
The truth is, since I
called this thing off,

136
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,531
my wife has been very grateful

137
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,999
and I could do with a down night.

138
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,100
If I go out with the boss,

139
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,969
nobody can blame me.

140
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:19,372
Okay. If you bring your wife.

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,041
No. That's the point.

142
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,175
I need a little-- you're lying.

143
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:23,276
I'm not lying.

144
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:25,211
Then I'm not going.

145
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,717
Okay. Fontina at 8:30.

146
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,923
You believe me, right?

147
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:39,292
Of course I believe you.

148
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,061
Then let's do it.

149
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,662
We'll tell a cab to
take us to AC right now

150
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,630
and get it done.

151
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:44,898
You're serious?

152
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,700
You just walked out
of the emergency room.

153
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,068
Exactly. I walked out.

154
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,502

155
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,273
Well, we do have

158
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:03,483
Oh, my God. Can somebody help us?

159
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,618
Please! Please hurry.

160
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,454
Just breathe. Oh, my God.

161
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:11,825
There's gotta be a better
way to call off a wedding.

162
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,426
A Tweet, for example.

163
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,161
Pleural effusion.

164
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,731
You think his lung is faking it?

165
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,899
There's at least 200
ccs of fluid in there.

166
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,369
Okay, let's say all
his symptoms are real.

167
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,105
Explain how one of
them suddenly went away

168
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,340
without using the words "
virgin" or "mary."

169
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:30,176
If the pleural effusion's
caused by something systemic,

170
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,746
it could explain his
other two symptoms.

171
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,147
And so whether you
believe him or not,

172
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,949
all we have to figure out
is what caused the pe.

173
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,617
ER ruled out infection.

174
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,819
Eosinophil count
ruled out parasites.

175
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,322
A medication he's not
telling us about.

176
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,823
You really don't trust
this guy, do you?

177
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:47,093
I don't even trust the ER.

178
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:49,095
Let's rule out
infections ourselves.

179
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:50,764
Tap his lungs, send cultures,

180
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,599
run cytology for cancer,
and check his blood pressure.

181
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,000
We already--

182
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,302
this time, talk about
nuptials while you do it.

183
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,871
Check his home for everything else.

184
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,306
He just moved in with his
fiancee three months ago.

185
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,176
Toxic exposure could take
longer than that to manifest.

186
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,812
You check his love nest.

187
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,814
You two check his
swinging bachelor pad.

188
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,582
That somebody else now lives in?

189
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,484
I assume so.

190
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,323
Not the glass. No!

191
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:26,466
The place looks like...1960s?

192
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,067
Could have lead paint.

193
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,470
You think a 27-year-old has pica?

194
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:31,938
If it gets us out of here

195
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:36,009
before the owner comes back, yes.

196
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,211
What'd you tell that cute physio?

197
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,114
That I changed my mind.

198
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,016
No, you didn't.

199
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,851
You're more nervous than usual.

200
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,988
Because this B and E has actual B.

201
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,224
Wha...

202
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,426
That's a suspended ceiling.

203
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,931
What are you doing?

204
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,699
I want to see what's above it.

205
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:03,870
More ceiling.

206
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:07,574
Made of 40-year-old acoustic tile.

207
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,175
Asbestosis. I like it.

208
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,577
I'll be in the car.

209
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,846
<i>What the hell?</i>

210
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,447
Uh, it's okay.

211
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:15,481
We're doctors.

212
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,816
Nobody was home, so--

213
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,318
well, I'm calling the police.

214
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:21,054
Do you know Ted Taylor?
He used to live here.

215
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,689
Yeah. What about him?

216
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,224
He's our patient at
Princeton Plainsboro.

217
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,692
Is he okay?

218
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,860
We think he may have asbestosis

219
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,528
from your ceiling tiles.

220
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:29,929
They're not asbestos.
I had 'em checked when I moved in.

221
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,798
How sick is he?

222
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,132
Is he a friend of yours?

223
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,500
<i>He was.</i>

224
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:38,805
Actually, he was my
boyfriend for three years.

225
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,159
I'm not gay.  <i>Really?</i>

226
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,027
'Cause it would certainly
explain the cold feet.

227
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,962
Oh, and the boyfriend.

228
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,864
So you're bisexual?

229
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:51,666
No, I'm straight.

230
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,401
<i>Cotter, the guy you met, he's gay.</i>

231
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:57,742
He had a crush on me. I left.

232
00:10:57,809 --> 00:10:59,410
After three years? Well,
it's possible.

233
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:00,745
It doesn't mean you're gay

234
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:02,146
just 'cause the guy
you're sleeping with is.

235
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:03,581
We weren't sleeping together.

236
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:04,915
What's this got to
do with anything?

237
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,984
Lung tap turned up mononucleosis.

238
00:11:07,052 --> 00:11:08,486
ER doesn't routinely test for it.

239
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:10,020
It explains the pe

240
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:12,189
and can be virtually asymptomatic.

241
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:14,291
So we got to wondering,
how does a 27-year-old get mono?

242
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:16,360
You're a little old for
the kissing disease,

243
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,562
unless your immune
system is compromised.

244
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,398
If there's been any
unprotected sex,

245
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:21,799
we'll need to test for HIV.

246
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,001
There's been no sex of any kind.

247
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:27,972
Okay. I'll go test
your fiancee for HIV.

248
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,473
Is she the curious sort?

249
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,208
Wait.

250
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:36,480
There may have been some contact,

251
00:11:36,548 --> 00:11:38,182
but I'm not gay.

252
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,384
Sodomy, one of the top ten

253
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:42,052
most common household accidents.

254
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,487
I did a lot of stupid things,

255
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:44,789
but I turned my life around.

256
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:46,290
I'm as straight as any of you.

257
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,592
<i>You don't have to believe me.</i>

258
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,830
I'm just saying you can test me...

259
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:54,799
As long as you don't tell Nicole.

260
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:58,202
What business is it of hers?

261
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,403
I don't see anything wrong

262
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:00,738
with him marrying a straight woman.

263
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,573
How about, it'll make
them both miserable?

264
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,775
Just like most straight marriages.

265
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:06,944
He's got the right to life,
liberty, and unhappiness,

266
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,879
like the rest of us.

267
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:10,748
Absolutely no reason to look at me.

268
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,116
<i>I'm not saying it's a great choice.</i>

269
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:13,851
Just saying it's his choice.

270
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,953
It has to be hers as well,
which it can't be

271
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,721
as long as she doesn't
know he's gay.

272
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:18,923
Which is how it's gonna stay

273
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,391
since we have no right to tell her.

274
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,259
Like you've never bent the rules.

275
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,728
You date guys. You date girls.

276
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:26,931
I assume at some point,
you're gonna make a choice.

277
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:28,966
I don't lie about who I am.

278
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,201
Patients lying never
bothered you before.

279
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:31,435
Patients weren't lying

280
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:32,470
about their sexual
orientation before.

281
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:34,205
So you're only judgmental

282
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:35,506
when it gets personal.

283
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:37,641
Does it bother me that
people hurt others

284
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,276
because they're too
weak to face the truth?

285
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:41,145
Yeah. Sorry about that.

286
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:43,314
Tell me she's not looking at me.

287
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:51,789
He's negative? Yep.

288
00:12:51,857 --> 00:12:54,625
Looks like being gay
didn't make him sick.

289
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:58,629
So maybe being straight did.

290
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,066
The test was negative. No HIV.

291
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,300
I told you.

292
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,336
What you didn't tell us

293
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:07,338
is how you turned your life around.

294
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,273
It can be pretty hard. It was.

295
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,275
Downright impossible on your own.

296
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:12,810
I talked to some people.

297
00:13:12,878 --> 00:13:14,945
It was more than just talk,
wasn't it?

298
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:20,384
I know this is personal stuff.

299
00:13:20,452 --> 00:13:23,087
I'm here to help you, not out you.

300
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:29,426
I had therapy.

301
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:31,061
Conversion therapy.

302
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:34,431
Went to a camp for three weeks
of intensive rehabilitation.

303
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:38,068
They injected him with emetics
while he watched gay porn.

304
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:39,303
Apomorphine?

305
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:41,472
Or lithium chloride
or cyclophosphamide.

306
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,573
He doesn't know.

307
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:43,908
And when that didn't work,

308
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,976
<i>they shot him up with male hormones.</i>

309
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:47,578
A chemical assault like
that could explain the pe.

310
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:49,880
And the ECT explains the rest.

311
00:13:49,948 --> 00:13:52,816
They gave him electroconvulsive
therapy to make him straight?

312
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:54,852
To zap the fabulous
right out of him.

313
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,787
Neural damage accounts
for the aphasia.

314
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:58,489
ECT doesn't cause neural damage.

315
00:13:58,557 --> 00:13:59,790
Unless it was done

316
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,826
at Dr. Liberace's
he-man quackery camp.

317
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:04,361
Run an EEG.

318
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,898
See if they straightened
him or just scrambled him.

319
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,512
Sorry. I completely forgot.

320
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,049
My wife just started a ceramics
class Tuesdays at 8:00.

321
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,084
It's a half-hour drive from here.

322
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:30,454
She won't be back till 10:30.

323
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:33,490
She's taking it with
her girlfriend marly.

324
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:36,060
She hopes to make a tea service.

325
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,396
You want to call her?

326
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:42,199
No need. I already texted her.

327
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:46,503
And here she is now.

328
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:50,874
I think you're still
seeing the physio.

329
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:53,577
You've got a backup
suit in your car.

330
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,913
Don't want to be
bringing home da stank.

331
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:57,815
Okay, yes, you're right,
about everything.

332
00:14:57,882 --> 00:14:58,983
But please, House. Don't tell her.

333
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,352
Hi, Rachel. Hi, Dr. House.

334
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:02,586
I didn't know you'd be here.

335
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:04,688
Hi, honey.
Got your text, obviously.

336
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:06,490
I'm just leaving.

337
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,792
I've got a ceramics class.

338
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,328
Really? <i>I love it.</i>

339
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:13,597
Even managed to talk Chris
into signing up for one.

340
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:15,265
Of course, he's in
the beginners' class.

341
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,668
You're in a ceramics class?

342
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:19,103
Friday nights, right?

343
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,238
Friday nights. Sounded like fun.

344
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,309
You should join Chris'.

345
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:27,177
You know, I should.

346
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:29,480
Well, gotta go.

347
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:31,849
Making a tea service.

348
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:43,661
Hi, I must have fallen
asleep in the lounge.

349
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:44,895
What are they doing?

350
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:45,963
An EEG.

351
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:47,765
What's it for?

352
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:49,633
We're looking for
neurological damage

353
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:50,567
that could have
caused his symptoms.

354
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,069
Damage from what?

355
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,138
A head trauma.

356
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:56,040
He had an accident?

357
00:15:56,107 --> 00:15:57,374
It wasn't an accident.

358
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,243
It was before he met you.

359
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,745
Well, what happened?
Was he hospitalized?

360
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:04,114
You should ask him about it.

361
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,786
They have the results.

362
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:18,028
Everything looks normal.

363
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:20,364
Look at this.

364
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:21,598
Beta waves are spiking.

365
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,599
What's that mean?

366
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,134
I'm not sure.

367
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,737
He's coding. Crash cart.

368
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:28,605
What's happening to him?

369
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:30,207
He's having a heart attack.

370
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:34,545
Charging. Clear.

371
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,354
EKG showed no abnormalities.

372
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,433
So what caused the arrest?

373
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,501
<i>Four ways to stop a heart.</i>

374
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,904
Electrical problems,
restricted blood flow,

375
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,038
blood where it shouldn't be,

376
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,240
shocks, blocks, or bleeds.

377
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,608
I think that's three things.

378
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,910
And cheating.

379
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,746
Oh, no. Sorry.

380
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,081
That's how you break a heart.

381
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:59,552
I found a ceramics class
in Trenton on Friday nights

382
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,988
that was full so my
wife couldn't join me.

383
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:06,659
Ep study ruled out shocks.

384
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:09,762
Now you just have to find
some pottery by Taub.

385
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,363
The lamer it looks, the better.

386
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,765
<i>So we'll do an angio</i>

387
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,066
to see if it's blocks or bleeds.

388
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,067
You should be a doctor.

389
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,545
I'm gonna check out this
new lesbian bar tonight.

390
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,814
Your life is awesome.

391
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,217
You want to come?

392
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,896
I was telling a 33-year-old woman

393
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:45,164
that she has breast cancer.

394
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,800
No, you weren't. How do you know?

395
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,301
Because if you were,
you'd need to see

396
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,037
the pain in her eyes so she
could see the concern in yours.

397
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,340
Why are you setting me
up on dates with my team?

398
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,542
Taub asking me out was quirky,

399
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,878
but Thirteen doing
it is a barking cat.

400
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,646
I'm doing it to help you.

401
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:01,580
By setting me up with a hottie

402
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,482
that I can't sleep with?

403
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,817
And Thirteen?

404
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,585
I've been spending
more time with Sam.

405
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:07,987
I know it's been hard on you.

406
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,488
I figured if you had some company--

407
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,990
I don't need your help.

408
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,958
Then consider it helping our
neighbor's four-year-old.

409
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,261
I gave him a dollar.

410
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,796
How much did you have to pay?

411
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:17,963
Nothing.

412
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,498
I just told them you
might be feeling down

413
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,800
and it was in their self-interest

414
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,201
to keep you company.

415
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,871
100 bucks.

416
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,439
Foreman held out for 200.

417
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,175
House, I'm worried about you.

418
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,610
You could have ended
up in jail or worse.

419
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,913
Racking you with guilt.

420
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,649
So I do something really
stupid and you reward me.

421
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,684
Read any parenting manual.

422
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,653
That's not helping me.
That's helping you.

423
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,089
Fine, I did it for me,
for my relationship,

424
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,858
out of pure self-interest.

425
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:49,094
Okay.

426
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,462
You'll do it?

427
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,665
For you.

428
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,834
Thank you.

429
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,268
It's not gonna work, though.

430
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,137
Maybe.

431
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:01,140
But how bad can a night
out at a lesbian bar be?

432
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:13,152
Hey. How are you doing?

433
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,222
Heart attack at 27.

434
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,993
Um, they said you
had a head trauma.

435
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:25,297
I fell off a stepladder and-
-and hit my head.

436
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,633
It was a stupid accident.

437
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,735
An accident.

438
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,572
We need to prep you for your angio.

439
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,608
Valium will help you relax.

440
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,044
We're gonna run a line
through your femoral artery.

441
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,080
Ted? He's having
another heart attack?

442
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,882
I don't think so.
His heart rate seems normal.

443
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,020
Are you okay?

444
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,656
You weren't discussing
wedding plans, were you?

445
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,591
No.

446
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,093
I guess I just...

447
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,264
Fainted.

448
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,232
P.O.T.S.

449
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,002
Postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome.

450
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,703
BP plummets when he's upright,

451
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,305
reverts to normal
when he's lying down.

452
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,606
He was lying down

453
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:08,741
both times we took
his blood pressure.

454
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:09,842
Protracted hypotension

455
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,143
could have induced
his heart attack.

456
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,211
Also explains the syncope.

457
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,245
And his aphasia.

458
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,380
He was upright,

459
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,347
then you laid him down on the bed

460
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,582
to test him.

461
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,217
BP reverted to normal.
Voice came back.

462
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,885
Jabbing him with the needle
had nothing to do with it.

463
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,153
P.O.T.S. can be brought on

464
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,988
by a viral or bacterial
infection such as mono.

465
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,724
So load him up with
fludrocortisone.

466
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,360
You didn't read your ceramics
course description, did you?

467
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,396
Yeah. You did?

468
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,064
As I'm sure your wife did.

469
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,433
So we all know they're doing
a fourth of July theme.

470
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,069
She'll be expecting
something star-spangled.

471
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,775
<i>Nicole?</i>

472
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:43,976
Yes?

473
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,045
Cotter Macklin.

474
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,813
I'm an old friend of Ted's.

475
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:48,914
Hi.

476
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,483
How's he doing?

477
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,086
Um, he had a heart attack.

478
00:20:56,623 --> 00:21:00,426
Oh, my God.

479
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,660
They have him on some new meds.

480
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,263
<i>Really knocked him out.</i>

481
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,898
Well, how are you holding up?

482
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:09,268
I'm okay. Thanks.

483
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:14,273
Um, I brought this for him.

484
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,575
That's his favorite thing
in the whole world.

485
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,510
I know.

486
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,350
You weren't at the wedding,
were you?

487
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:28,120
No, I-I wasn't invited.

488
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:32,257
Ted and I had a-a falling out.

489
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:35,661
How did you know each other?

490
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:39,031
Um, we met senior year of college.

491
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,367
Yeah, we--we shared
a house for a while.

492
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,768
You were roommates?

493
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:45,704
For three years.

494
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,985
I'm--I'm sorry.

495
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,521
I-I just miss him.

496
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:05,024
I think you should leave.

497
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,358
I shouldn't have done that.

498
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,093
Now.

499
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,262
Please.

500
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:22,741
I hope he gets better.

501
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:38,009
Hey, how are you feeling?

502
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:40,344
Hmm. Don't know yet.

503
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:41,512
<i>Your numbers look good.</i>

504
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,447
We're gonna keep you on these meds.

505
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:05,269
You had a visitor
while you were asleep.

506
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:06,937
Oh, yeah? Who?

507
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:10,608
Cotter. Who is he?

508
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:12,843
I shared a house with
him after college.

509
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:16,881
I don't know why he would show up.

510
00:23:16,948 --> 00:23:19,316
That's it? <i>Yeah.</i>

511
00:23:19,384 --> 00:23:22,953
Why? What did he say?

512
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:38,869
I need to hear it from you, Ted.

513
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:53,851
One night, I got really drunk

514
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,822
and I went to bed.

515
00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:02,426
And he came into my room.

516
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:05,996
One thing led to another.

517
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:08,199
The whole thing was a mistake.

518
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:11,235
Are you saying you
had sex with him?

519
00:24:11,303 --> 00:24:14,205
I was drunk and confused.

520
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:15,306
You're gay?

521
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:17,441
No.

522
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:22,179
I thought I was.

523
00:24:23,782 --> 00:24:28,185
I even made up my mind
to tell my family.

524
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:29,820
I stood in front of
the bathroom mirror,

525
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:31,522
psyching myself up.

526
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,092
All I could see was disgust.

527
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,062
And that's when I realized,

528
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,499
I didn't hate the thought
of admitting I was gay

529
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:43,601
because I was ashamed.

530
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:47,605
I hated the thought
because I wasn't gay.

531
00:24:47,672 --> 00:24:51,375
And that was the day
I went to get help.

532
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:54,945
So you're not gay?

533
00:24:55,013 --> 00:24:56,847
They cured me, Nicole.

534
00:24:56,915 --> 00:25:01,252
That's what all the
head trauma is about.

535
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,

536
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:06,457
but it's--it's all in the past now.

537
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:08,292
It doesn't matter anymore.

538
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:15,299
What is it?

539
00:25:18,236 --> 00:25:20,604
Oh, my head!

540
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,408
He's got severe headaches.

541
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:26,277
So do I.

542
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:29,947
Should I call or raise
with a double gutshot draw?

543
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:34,618
No.

544
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:36,220
What about infection?
That's what we're thinking.

545
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:38,222
Cerebral infection would
explain the headaches,

546
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,690
could have caused P.O.T.S.

547
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:41,192
If it's fungal, it could
have spread to the heart.

548
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:42,927
I was talking about you.

549
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:45,896
Has the little gent
been wearing a tent?

550
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:49,466
Remind me why that has
anything to do with you.

551
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:52,403
A distracted person makes
a distracted professional.

552
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,538
And destroying my marriage
will help me focus.

553
00:25:54,606 --> 00:25:56,607
Probably.

554
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:59,910
Do a spinal tap. Run the CSF.

555
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:02,179
Still talking about you.

556
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:05,015
But you can do it on the patient,
too, if you want.

557
00:26:11,756 --> 00:26:19,530
♪ ♪

558
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,235
what about her?

559
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:25,936
The bartender?

560
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:28,739
She's the only one
who's not here for fun.

561
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:30,307
Trust me, she's not straight.

562
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,710
If your gaydar is so great,

563
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:34,378
how come you didn't
know about the patient

564
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:35,512
till you met his boyfriend?

565
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,348
The guy walked in with his bride.

566
00:26:37,415 --> 00:26:39,717
It took me a while
to rotate my dish.

567
00:26:39,784 --> 00:26:42,620
It's unbelievable what
he's doing to her.

568
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:44,421
You don't think he loves her?

569
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:45,990
He may love her,

570
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:47,558
but he needs to have
sex with other men.

571
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:48,859
Taub loves his wife,

572
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,895
but he needs to have
sex with other women.

573
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:53,230
Yeah, it sucks what
he's doing to her too,

574
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:54,431
but it's hardly the same.

575
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:55,866
To be faithful to his wife,

576
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:57,701
our patient has to
deny his identity.

577
00:26:57,769 --> 00:26:58,869
Taub just needs to--

578
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:00,771
to resist a biological imperative?

579
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:03,140
It is easier to say no to dessert

580
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,441
than to pretend you don't eat.

581
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:06,610
Says someone who's obviously
never been on a diet.

582
00:27:06,678 --> 00:27:10,180
Oh, yeah. My life's a breeze.

583
00:27:10,248 --> 00:27:12,483
You're successful, smart,

584
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,485
and you attract
everything that moves.

585
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:16,053
If you want to focus on the fact

586
00:27:16,121 --> 00:27:18,289
that you're not gonna see 50,
that's your choice.

587
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:20,157
You know what? I agree with you.

588
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:23,193
My self-pity's optional.
What about yours?

589
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:30,501
Yeah?

590
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:32,569
CSF was negative for infection,

591
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:33,637
and his headaches are worse.

592
00:27:33,705 --> 00:27:35,005
We were just talking about you.

593
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:36,573
Please don't.

594
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:38,609
It's not P.O.T.S.
, so we're back to square one.

595
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:46,984
Not quite.

596
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:49,520
You did a spinal tap,
but the headaches got worse.

597
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:51,021
We're maxing him out on morphine.

598
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:52,790
He sprung a leak.

599
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:54,792
He's losing CSF from the tap site.

600
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:56,393
We made his headaches worse?

601
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:58,562
<i>Just you, actually.</i>

602
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,064
That still wouldn't explain

603
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:01,732
why he got the headaches
in the first place.

604
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,034
The low pressure in his
brain caused the P.O.T.S.,

605
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:05,135
not the other way around.

606
00:28:05,203 --> 00:28:06,470
Patch the leak

607
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:08,405
<i>and top him up with artificial CSF.</i>

608
00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:21,385
There. That should stop the leak.

609
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:23,721
You should be feeling
some relief soon.

610
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,727
I spoke to my parents.

611
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:31,428
How are they doing?

612
00:28:31,496 --> 00:28:33,564
They're still worried.

613
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:36,300
Well, tell them not to be.

614
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:39,036
Everything's gonna be okay.

615
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:43,674
Ted?

616
00:28:43,742 --> 00:28:45,075
What's happening?

617
00:28:45,143 --> 00:28:46,343
He's stroking.

618
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:49,279
Both eyes are responsive.

619
00:28:49,347 --> 00:28:50,414
Tell me your full name.

620
00:28:50,482 --> 00:28:52,116
Theodore Philip Taylor.

621
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:53,684
This isn't a stroke.
Then what is it?

622
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:56,120
What's happening to me?

623
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,420
It's really not P.O.T.S.

624
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:06,721
We're really back to square one.

625
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:09,557
So what's masquerading as a stroke?

626
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,993
Voted the worst Halloween
costume, by the way.

627
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:14,596
MRA showed no problems with
blood flow to the brain.

628
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:17,265
Rules out T.I.A.

629
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:20,568
Chest x-rays showed
no hilar masses.

630
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:21,803
Any luck with the pottery?

631
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:22,937
Wasn't easy.

632
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:24,539
Bought a suitably cruddy set

633
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:26,374
of fife and drum
napkin rings online.

634
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:27,342
Scleroderma?

635
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:28,409
Skin's fine.

636
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:29,978
A.N.A. was negative.

637
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:31,846
So what did that set
you back? Too much.

638
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:33,882
I got into a bidding
war with some lunatic.

639
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:35,216
Histoplasmosis.

640
00:29:35,284 --> 00:29:37,252
EIA was clear.

641
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:41,055
Hey, could have gone a
lot higher than $215.

642
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:45,193
You're kissmyasthma99?

643
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,528
<i>What about melas?</i>

644
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:48,396
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy,

645
00:29:48,464 --> 00:29:50,398
lactic acidosis,
and stroke-like episodes.

646
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:52,333
Nillas.

647
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:56,938
No, idiot. Lactate
levels are stable.

648
00:29:57,006 --> 00:29:58,640
We're missing something.

649
00:29:58,707 --> 00:29:59,841
<i>We've run every test that makes sense,</i>

650
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:01,042
asked every question
we can think of,

651
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,410
gone over his history
a dozen times.

652
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:04,145
We know how much we
can trust his history.

653
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:06,514
If history is written
by the Victor,

654
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:08,616
how do we find out
what really happened?

655
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:09,884
Talk to the loser.

656
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:11,119
Call the boyfriend.

657
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,554
Let's get them all
in the same room.

658
00:30:12,621 --> 00:30:13,621
Or we could question
them separately

659
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:14,822
and not torture them.

660
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,724
Or we could get them
all in the same room

661
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:17,825
and get the truth.

662
00:30:22,498 --> 00:30:26,935
Oh. Drinks are on me
and Foreman tonight.

663
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:28,436
Can't. Pap smear.

664
00:30:28,504 --> 00:30:29,470
We don't want to do it either,

665
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:30,705
but Wilson already paid us.

666
00:30:30,773 --> 00:30:31,873
It's gonna suck.

667
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:34,142
I know.

668
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:37,145
Where and when?

669
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,147
Any incidents of dizziness?

670
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:42,517
Seizures?

671
00:30:42,585 --> 00:30:43,885
Blackouts?

672
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:46,788
Other than our wedding day.

673
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:49,290
Don't you think I would
have told you if there were?

674
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:50,925
My sister's birthday.

675
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:52,560
I was drunk.

676
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:54,028
You had one Martini.

677
00:30:54,096 --> 00:30:55,330
On an empty stomach.

678
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:56,831
Look, he was just
sitting on the couch,

679
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:59,200
and then he--he-
he fell over and that was it.

680
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:01,502
Well, once I slept it off,
I was fine.

681
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,172
Well, I stayed up that night,

682
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,007
checking on him every 15 minutes.

683
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:07,942
What about sex?

684
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,311
Yes, I have sex with my girlfriend,

685
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:12,547
because I'm not gay.

686
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:16,084
We have sex. Thank you.

687
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:17,885
No problems?

688
00:31:17,953 --> 00:31:22,790
Um, well, there have been some...

689
00:31:22,858 --> 00:31:24,292
Nic. <i>Issues.</i>

690
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,493
Erectile dysfunction?

691
00:31:25,561 --> 00:31:28,663
Every guy has it sometimes.

692
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,735
We never had that problem.

693
00:31:33,802 --> 00:31:37,305
Gee, that must be because
Ted doesn't like girls.

694
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:38,406
<i>Or because it's vascular.</i>

695
00:31:38,474 --> 00:31:40,441
I know we did an MRA,

696
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:42,610
<i>but arterial disease causing
acute ischemia</i>

697
00:31:42,678 --> 00:31:44,679
<i>could explain the heart,
neuro symptoms,</i>

698
00:31:44,747 --> 00:31:46,447
and maybe even P.O.T.S.

699
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:49,484
Might I suggest a diagnostic test?

700
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,921
The penile plethysmograph

701
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:55,890
measures changes in blood
flow in your penis.

702
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:59,527
Tells us if there's a
circulatory problem.

703
00:31:59,595 --> 00:32:02,096
You just need to be
in the right... state.

704
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:03,665
What's your pleasure?

705
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:04,999
I feel terrible.

706
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:07,402
I-I don't think
anything's gonna work.

707
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,237
Then we'll have to give you a shot.

708
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,305
Where you don't want to get one.

709
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:15,143

The night just keeps
getting better.

744
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:36,858
To Wilson.

745
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:39,794
Wilson. Wilson.

746
00:33:39,862 --> 00:33:41,896
Everything looks fine.

747
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:43,798
You sure?

748
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:47,468
Medically, that's good news.

749
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:49,303
Are you feeling feverish?
You're sweating.

750
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:53,441
No. I feel lousy,
but I don't know why I'm sweating.

751
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:57,945
What is it?

752
00:33:58,013 --> 00:33:59,347
You're not sweating.

753
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,085
You're lactating.

754
00:34:06,654 --> 00:34:08,888
Can't tell his fiancee he's gay,

755
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:11,758
how is he gonna tell
her he's pregnant?

756
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:15,929
His therapists loaded
him with hormones.

757
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:18,765
Male hormones don't
make you lactate.

758
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,834
Except they could
screw up your thyroid.

759
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:21,968
<i>That was over three months ago.</i>

760
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:23,703
We just started milking
him last night.

761
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,705
So something else
screwed up his thyroid.

762
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,674
Graves, hashimoto's.

763
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:31,211
Nope. TSH was normal.

764
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,479
<i>Pituitary tumor.</i>

765
00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:33,747
Could also explain

766
00:34:33,814 --> 00:34:35,148
<i>his libido</i>

767
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:37,250
and heart issues.

768
00:34:37,318 --> 00:34:40,787
And if the tumor's big enough,
his headaches and syncope.

769
00:34:42,423 --> 00:34:45,558
Except we--
we cleared him for cancer.

770
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,327
<i>Didn't say "cancer."</i>

771
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:48,895
Prolactinomas can be benign.

772
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:57,470
Check his prolactin level,
then MRI his pituitary.

773
00:35:10,905 --> 00:35:13,273
Sounds like you had fun last night.

774
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:14,975
You believe Chase?

775
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:17,177
I believe Foreman.

776
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:19,412
And they had fun with you.

777
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,249
<i>What happened?</i>

778
00:35:23,317 --> 00:35:27,053
I realized that they
could be my friends.

779
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:31,758
You're serious.

780
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:33,827
And then I sobered up.

781
00:35:33,894 --> 00:35:35,328
You weren't that drunk.

782
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:36,997
You managed to find your way

783
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:38,298
<i>into your own little bed last night.</i>

784
00:35:38,366 --> 00:35:40,834
I think I sleep better
in rocket ship sheets.

785
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:44,204
No, you want to blame this on
the booze, but that's easy.

786
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:45,739
<i>Change is hard.</i>

787
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:47,507
And wisdom is knowing
the difference

788
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:49,809
between what you can change...

789
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:56,616
And what you were born with.

790
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:58,551
And cowardice is labeling

791
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:01,855
what you don't want
to change as innate.

792
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:03,657
I was winning this argument.

793
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:08,995
Pituitary MRI--

794
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:11,031
was normal.

795
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:15,368
How are the headaches?

796
00:36:15,436 --> 00:36:17,137
Terrible.

797
00:36:17,204 --> 00:36:18,638
Give me your head.

798
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:20,607
What the hell? I know.

799
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:21,775
It's the first time
you've heard that sentence

800
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:23,243
with a possessive pronoun.

801
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:33,553
Oh, wow, that-- that's better.

802
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:42,062
Okay, enough.

803
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:44,397
How cool is that?

804
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:46,366
You have a chiari malformation,

805
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:47,934
<i>a narrowing in the base of
your skull</i>

806
00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:49,936
that can cut off CSF flow.

807
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:51,237
But it wasn't a problem

808
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:53,173
until the ECT at breeder boot camp

809
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
caused your brain to swell

810
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:55,809
just enough to plug the opening.

811
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:58,445
<i>And when your brain pressed up</i>
<i>against your pituitary,</i>

812
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:01,815
it signed you up for
la leche league.

813
00:37:01,882 --> 00:37:03,750
You still won't be pitching
a tent for your lady,

814
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:07,120
but that's just because,
you know, she's a lady.

815
00:37:07,188 --> 00:37:09,556
Its orthostatic effect
was mimicking P.O.T.S.

816
00:37:09,623 --> 00:37:12,092
It also does an uncanny
Christopher Walken.

817
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,561
Unfortunately,
if you treat it like P.O.T.S.,

818
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:15,695
it gets worse.

819
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:18,498
So as far as that goes, oops.

820
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:19,966
Proper treatment is surgery.

821
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:20,967
We'll get you in right away.

822
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:22,702
So how did I get this thing?

823
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,637
Overbearing mother.

824
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:28,041
Kidding. CM's congenital.

825
00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:31,745
Like so many other things,
you were born that way.

826
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:50,830
I thought you might
be running low, so...

827
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:52,866
Thanks.

828
00:37:55,669 --> 00:37:57,470
I'm not coming back.

829
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:01,875
Ted, this is a mistake.

830
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:03,743
I know you're hurting,
and I'm sorry.

831
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:06,446
I'm talking about hurting her.

832
00:38:06,514 --> 00:38:07,747
I love her.

833
00:38:07,815 --> 00:38:09,949
Ted.

834
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:13,153
Thank you for your support.

835
00:38:15,623 --> 00:38:18,057
We both really appreciate it.

836
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:22,262
Good luck.

837
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:46,452
Hey.

838
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:51,391
You know what I've been thinking?

839
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:55,528
It's your birthday in three weeks.

840
00:38:55,596 --> 00:38:58,364
What do you say we
rebook the church

841
00:38:58,432 --> 00:38:59,699
and make it a doubleheader?

842
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:03,336
I don't know, Ted.

843
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:06,439
Less than a week ago we
were standing at the altar,

844
00:39:06,507 --> 00:39:08,308
perfectly happy.

845
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,943
Nothing's changed.

846
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,811
Really?

847
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:15,315
I still love you.

848
00:39:15,382 --> 00:39:18,084
Do you still love me?

849
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:20,553
Yes.

850
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:22,422
But--

851
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:24,490
then that's all that matters.

852
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:30,830
But I think that
you still love him.

853
00:39:30,898 --> 00:39:35,201
I'm not gay, Nicole.

854
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:37,570
I promise you.

855
00:39:37,638 --> 00:39:41,107
How can you promise me that?

856
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:43,409
Because I believe that we get

857
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:45,011
to choose how we live our lives,

858
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:48,948
and I've made my choice.

859
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:52,385
So now I have to make mine.

860
00:39:54,088 --> 00:39:55,154
Nic.

861
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:57,690
I'm sorry.

862
00:39:57,758 --> 00:39:59,459
Nic.

863
00:40:01,328 --> 00:40:03,963
No. No.

864
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:07,767
I'm not saying good-bye.

865
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:09,736
Yeah.

866
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:13,907
I want to marry you.

867
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:18,011
I have to marry you.

868
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:20,246
<i>Nic!</i>

869
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:27,220
<i>It's Friday night.</i>

870
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:32,425
I called it off.

871
00:40:32,493 --> 00:40:34,127
For real this time.

872
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:36,996
Frees you up for the next one.

873
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:38,698
One day at a time.

874
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:44,804
Napkin rings.

875
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:47,006
My way of saying thanks.

876
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:49,042
For trying to wreck your marriage?

877
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:51,010
For trying to save it.

878
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:53,346
And I get napkin rings?

879
00:40:53,414 --> 00:40:56,282
Expensive ones.

880
00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:12,832
I hired a replacement.

881
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,368
For my P.A.

882
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:16,569
She seems great.

883
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:20,073
Good work. <i>You too.</i>

884
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,042
Your patient's going home tomorrow.

885
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,411
He doesn't have a home.

886
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:29,749
You want to grab a bite to eat?

887
00:41:31,752 --> 00:41:33,619
So Wilson got to you too?

888
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:37,890
No. This is just me.

889
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:40,727
Lucas? <i>Working late.</i>

890
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,998
I'm buying.

891
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:47,133
I'm not that hungry.

892
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,170
Okay.

893
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:01,547
I just want us to be friends.

894
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,553
Funny.

895
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:10,390
That's the last thing
I want us to be.
