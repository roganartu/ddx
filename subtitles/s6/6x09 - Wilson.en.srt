1
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:12,612
How the...

2
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:33,358
Most people...

3
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:34,713
go for the...

4
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:36,997
hardwood or carpeting.

5
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:39,915
I think guitars and garbage
work just as well.

6
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,826
Got the urge to play last night.

7
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:43,636
Had to go back to my apartment.

8
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,705
Thought I'd save on future trips.

9
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:48,498
It's very eco-friendly of you.

10
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,301
How about keeping down
on the noise pollution?

11
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:55,138
6:33. You should be flossing by now.

12
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:57,481
I'm not going to work today.

13
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,043
I'm going hunting.

14
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,681
After I sleep in.

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,185
Is it that time of year again?

16
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:23,750
- He's a self-important jerk.
- He's my friend.

17
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:26,308
He's a self-important jerk.

18
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:28,672
Seems to be what I'm attracted to.

19
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,174
Guy calls you Jim.
Doesn't even know your name.

20
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,551
Jim is short for James.

21
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:34,938
Now go away,

22
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:36,435
Lim.

23
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:42,972
Nice shot.

24
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:46,786
I nailed that tree.

25
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:51,095
Maple syrup for dinner.
We should have got a guide.

26
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,202
Doesn't count as new adventure
if you have someone holding your hand.

27
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:56,389
On the other hand,
we are holding weapons

28
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:58,297
and have no idea what we're doing.

29
00:01:58,422 --> 00:01:59,271
Fun.

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,238
We need to sneak up on them.

31
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:05,002
I read that the native Americans
say turkeys know what you're thinking.

32
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:07,300
So I should stop thinking
about German porn.

33
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,378
That'll lure them closer.

34
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,000
We're terrible at this.

35
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:23,926
At least it's cold

36
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:25,809
and my new boots leak.

37
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:28,253
It's almost time anyway.
Did you bring the bag?

38
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,207
May 30, 2004.

39
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:47,497
10:07 a.m.

40
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,141
Dr. Wilson informed me
that if treatment didn't go well,

41
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:52,589
my leukemia would give me
only six more months to live.

42
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:54,544
November 30, 2004.

43
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:57,093
Six months later, I didn't die.

44
00:02:57,794 --> 00:02:59,171
As long as I am alive,

45
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,598
I will find new and exciting ways
to thank you

46
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,617
for giving me another year.

47
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:11,151
Now move very,
very far away from there

48
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:13,902
so that I can be sure
and thank you again next year.

49
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:32,652
Thanks, Jim.

50
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:38,541
All right, let's see
how many more turkeys we can miss.

51
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:44,757
This will work.

52
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,520
- What the hell?
- God.

53
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:52,148
Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I can't move my arm.

54
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,369
Am I having a stroke?

55
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:01,617
I don't know.

00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:46,661
Good news. Head CT doesn't show
any signs of a stroke.

61
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,079
So he's gonna be okay?

62
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:52,168
I cannot believe
how much you've grown up in five years.

63
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,126
She's...

64
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:56,045
She's not family.

65
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:59,298
Ashley, my girlfriend.
New life, new adventures.

66
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,968
- Ashley, meet Jim.
- It's good to meet you.

67
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:04,721
So this arm thing,
does that mean his leukemia's back?

68
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,321
I checked blood counts
and blood cell morphologies.

69
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:11,039
- Everything is normal.
- So these blood tests,

70
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,770
it means it's not cancer for sure.

71
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:15,064
- He said I'm fine.
- So what it is?

72
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:17,202
Hopefully something innocuous.

73
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,359
There's a doctor I can speak to
who's great...

74
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,115
Who's great at diagnosing...

75
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,822
What?

76
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,814
Sorry, that cold sore,
how long have you had that?

77
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:30,892
Two weeks. I'm sorry.
I got the call.

78
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:33,166
- I didn't have time to cover it up.
- What is it?

79
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,816
That cold sore is caused by a virus.

80
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:39,505
Assuming you kiss,

81
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,066
the virus could transfer,

82
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,237
infect your spine,
and cause the paralysis.

83
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:45,094
A disease
called transverse myelitis.

84
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,962
- And is that good news or bad news?
- It's great news.

85
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:50,695
I'll get you a room
and start you on acyclovir.

86
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,269
I just had a House moment.

87
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:30,158
Diagnosed transverse myelitis
from a cold sore.

88
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:31,633
How cool is that?

89
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,934
Patients really eat that crap up.

90
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,561
It's why I'm loved.

91
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:39,482
- What am I doing here?
- Ultrasound is clear.

92
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:41,150
He's definitely not pregnant.

93
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,319
No gall stones.

94
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,280
Could be diverticulitis.

95
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:49,700
- Have you eaten any seeds?
- I'm joining you, Antonio Aguilar.

96
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,538
We'll play in God's Mariachi band.

97
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,963
Draw some blood.

98
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,307
The self-important jerk
does not have transverse myelitis.

99
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,169
He's got cancer.

100
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:01,379
How do you...

101
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:05,424
Maybe I paid the redhead down
in records a few bucks

102
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,509
to cc me on all your cases.

103
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:11,639
Patients die, you might get sad again.
Make a speech would end your career.

104
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,042
Frankly, I'm stalking you for you.

105
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,258
- How long does a blood draw take?
- Almost finished.

106
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:19,855
When you're finished
almost finishing it, test it.

107
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,340
<i>Mi estomago</i>'s ripped open
by the hand of God.</i>

108
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:25,152
- He spilled my blood.
- Confusion. Delirium.

109
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,720
Why rule out
the hand of God so fast?

110
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,740
Your guy's low white count

111
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,076
and right arm paralysis
equals a recurrence

112
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,452
of his leukemia.

113
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:34,897
Simple math.

114
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,166
Did you look past
the first page of the file?

115
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,836
No AML cells anywhere.
I did the blood smears myself.

116
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:43,337
It's still cancer.

117
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:45,673
You know how I know?

118
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,677
He's got an oncologist for a doctor.

119
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,992
And your magical leukemia detector

120
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:51,929
is more powerful
than a flow cytometer?

121
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,338
I look for zebras

122
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:55,804
because other doctors
rule out all the horses.

123
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,852
In this case,
you are those other doctors.

124
00:07:58,206 --> 00:07:59,895
You haven't earned a zebra.

125
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,314
- 100 bucks.
- Are you serious?

126
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,955
Friends don't diagnose
friends with cancer.

127
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,901
I get it.

128
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,074
Your problem is you're not objective.
Your caring is clouding your diagnosis.

129
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:13,467
Just cut that out
and you could be a pretty decent doctor.

130
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:15,786
Just give me the lactic acid level.

131
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:16,761
27.

132
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:20,277
The fact
that you can't speak English

133
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:23,294
is not an excuse for you not being
humiliated by what I'm about to say.

134
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,493
It's also not an excuse for you
not telling us

135
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:27,669
that you were a tennis pro.
If you had,

136
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:29,717
- we wouldn't have wasted our time.
- Fine.

137
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:30,885
100 bucks.

138
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,979
Is Tucker settling in?

139
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,311
Already got
his first dose of acyclovir.

140
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,121
And don't worry,
I ordered his girlfriend the kiddy meal.

141
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:43,897
Next patient on deck.

142
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:47,232
Del Clinton, day six of chemo.
You just missed the grandkids.

143
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,048
That's all right.

144
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:52,023
Last time they were here,
they painted my tie.

145
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,702
You're almost ready to go home.

146
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:58,584
You feeling okay?

147
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,624
I feel like I felt
after the last four rounds.

148
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:04,293
In oncology,
familiar pain means all is well.

149
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,628
So that's good, right?

150
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:09,989
I heard Jesse and Zeke
were by earlier.

151
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:14,022
Sorry, Del, I gotta run.

152
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:20,800
How are they doing?

153
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:22,019
They're fine.

154
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:25,889
No game-winning hits?
No aced report cards?

155
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:28,067
- No school plays?
- I guess not.

156
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,111
I thought you had to go.

157
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:37,409
- Are you depressed?
- I have cancer.

158
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:39,829
You've had cancer for a long time.

159
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,695
It's never stopped you from bragging
about the grandkids.

160
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:46,794
I guess I'm feeling
a little more down than usual.

161
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:48,938
Can you give me something?

162
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,983
I don't want you to get alarmed,
but sometimes depression can be a sign

163
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:57,538
that something else is going on.
I'm just gonna order extra tests.

164
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:08,023
- What's going on?
- It's his foot now.

165
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,816
- It's nothing.
- It's not nothing.

166
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:13,936
I just started getting
a little tingling feeling in my foot.

167
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:16,949
- Is that bad?
- It's gonna be okay.

168
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:20,286
It might mean his foot fell asleep.
It might mean nothing.

169
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:22,160
Could you give us a few minutes?

170
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:25,165
- Why can't you tell me?
- Because you're making him nervous.

171
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,323
Give us a few minutes, okay, hon?

172
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,568
It's not the disease
you thought it was?

173
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,717
The medicine I gave you
is not working.

174
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,852
I might have to hit it harder.

175
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,222
I'm gonna add ribavirin
to your treatment.

176
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,194
Are you sure
that this isn't a recurrence?

177
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:48,306
- So the brave face is just for Ashley.
- She's young, she's terrified.

178
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,906
- She's not really equipped.
- Don't worry.

179
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,360
Once you've had cancer,

180
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,612
recurrence is your biggest fear.
I get it.

181
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:59,575
I've looked every which way there is.
That's not what's happening here.

182
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:02,870
Can you call my daughter
and ask her to come down?

183
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:04,951
You can't do it?

184
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:09,043
She hasn't exactly been talking to me
since I got together with Ashley.

185
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:11,298
I'd really like her to be here.

186
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:14,026
Of course.

187
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:20,453
Exactly how serious does it have to be
to justify you coming to see your dad?

188
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:24,668
No. I'm sorry.

189
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:28,010
I'd rather you regretted coming
than regretted not coming.

190
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:31,782
Thanks, Emily.

191
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:34,818
How's Tucker?

192
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,697
He's made a mess of his personal life.
But physically, he's gonna be fine.

193
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:41,575
- Transverse myelitis.
- What does House think?

194
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:45,244
What is this?
Is House my overseer now?

195
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,651
No, it's just not always a good idea

196
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:50,148
for doctors to treat
their friends, that's all.

197
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:52,277
House has got 100 bucks on cancer.

198
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,962
So unless you want in
on the action...

199
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:57,235
Is Bonnie still a realtor?

200
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:59,061
As far as I know.

201
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,886
Do you mind if I call her?

202
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,455
I'm looking for a new place.

203
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,339
I'm moving in with Lucas.

204
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,135
It wasn't the tennis.

205
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,563
You're moving in with Lucas?

206
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,714
You're Bonnie's friend.
You know how to reach her.

207
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,489
And yet instead of calling her,
you come and seek my permission.

208
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:23,450
You want my blessing,
and implicitly, House's blessing.

209
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,283
I don't need House's blessing.

210
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:27,343
Good.

211
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:37,034
So when will he be able
to move his arm again?

212
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,409
Should be soon.

213
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,483
Started smoking again?

214
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:43,679
Is it bad that he's coughing?

215
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:46,162
Hi, Dad.

216
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,643
Melissa, hey.
I didn't know you were coming.

217
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,322
I was at Mom's house
when Dr. Wilson called.

218
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:54,461
I can go if it's gonna be weird.

219
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:56,435
No, no, stay. It's fine.

220
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,677
- How are you?
- Is he okay?

221
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:01,198
He's okay.

222
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,854
I'm not a big fan
of this coughing though.

223
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,367
You must be Ashley.

224
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,504
Are you okay?

225
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,704
Do you think this cold sore thing
could've caused this?

226
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,044
No. Whatever's causing this
is affecting more than his nerves.

227
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,921
I need a crash cart in here!

228
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,952
{/pub}

229
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,183
Don't you guys have
a dying Mexican crooner to attend to?

230
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,519
He isn't dying anymore.
Found out he was on a popcorn diet.

231
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,063
Eating ten bags
of microwave popcorn a day.

232
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,524
Huffing the fumes scared his lungs.

233
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,470
That's...

234
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:42,529
very strange.
Where's House?

235
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,472
Performing his ritual "hiding from Cuddy
to avoid getting a new case" dance.

236
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:49,308
It's sort of a jazz-fusion
type of thing.

237
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,403
He's probably eating in the morgue.
I can page him.

238
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:55,500
Actually... maybe it would be better
if I talked to you alone.

239
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:58,253
House and I have a bet
about one of my patients.

240
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:01,256
You guys mind making him
100 bucks poorer?

241
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:05,886
43-year-old male
in remission from leukemia

242
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,564
presents with left arm paralysis
and trouble breathing.

243
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:11,558
- I assume House's money is on cancer.
- Thanks. That's very helpful.

244
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:14,588
- Subdural hematoma would explain...
- CT ruled it out.

245
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:17,314
I thought it was TM
I started antivirals, but he got worse.

246
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:18,831
Bacterial infection?

247
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:21,193
Bacteria'd move much faster.
He'd be dead already.

248
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,875
Could be fungal.

249
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,844
It would explain
his breathing problem,

250
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:27,213
but not his "unable to move
his arm" problem.

251
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:28,438
Actually,

252
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:30,805
if aspergillus fungus balls

253
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,120
took root in his lungs
and spread to his spine,

254
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,200
it would explain both.

255
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,007
The treatment involves riddling
the infected area

256
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,551
with BB-sized pellets
of antifungal meds.

257
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:49,240
I assume
you don't just load up the 12-gauge

258
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:50,847
and pepper me with birdshot.

259
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,030
No. We have a slightly
more humane delivery system.

260
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,686
But we do have to open you up.
It is surgery.

261
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:59,148
And like any operation,

262
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:01,204
there are risks.

263
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:03,079
What do you think, honey?

264
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,251
I don't know.

265
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:08,281
Is surgery really such a good idea?
He just seems so sick.

266
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:09,991
I just...

267
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,829
you should do
whatever you think is best.

268
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:16,530
Is this the only way
to go after this thing?

269
00:15:16,744 --> 00:15:20,418
Because of the rapid progression,
we don't have time to test or try IVS.

270
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,045
And he's strong enough.

271
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,129
Definitely.

272
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:25,924
- I want you there during the surgery.
- Of course.

273
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,219
You gotta do it.

274
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,191
Good.

275
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:36,387
Dr. Chase will be in here soon
to get you set for the O.R.

276
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:40,322
Page Dr. Chase to Tucker's room
for a surgery consult.

277
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:43,270
- And can you get me...
- Mr. Koplovitz wants to talk to you.

278
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,636
- Everything all right?
- He wanted to talk to his doctor,

279
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,293
not his doctor's assistant.

280
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:50,253
- And House is looking for you.
- What did you tell him?

281
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:53,366
That you were in the clinic.
I figure that gives you about 10 min.

282
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:55,625
Here.
Mr. Koplovitz's chart. Go.

283
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:00,834
Hello, Saul.

284
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,878
- I heard you were looking for me.
- I'm very tired.

285
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:05,912
But I can't sleep.

286
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:07,465
Today's your lucky day.

287
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,661
I happen to be a sleep specialist.

288
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:12,034
Thanks, Doc.

289
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:30,036
- Can a guy get a little privacy?
- Nice hiding spot.

290
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:31,406
Actually, it's perfect.

291
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:34,340
It allows me to hide from Cuddy
and find you.

292
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:36,232
What did she want?

293
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,580
She was checking up on Tucker
thanks to you.

294
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,664
That's it?

295
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:43,001
Like what?
Something about you?

296
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,337
Something you could interpret
as being about you?

297
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:47,181
An anagram maybe?

298
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,051
Play hide and seek somewhere else.

299
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,543
- My patient...
- No problem.

300
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:52,915
Give me the 100 bucks you owe me
and I'm gone.

301
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,412
Tucker doesn't have cancer.

302
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:56,931
He doesn't have a ball of fungus
in his lungs either.

303
00:16:57,238 --> 00:16:59,642
Next time you want to use my team,
at least leave a tip.

304
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:01,711
I'm late for surgery.

305
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:05,558
Your assistant said you'd be in here.
I talked to Bonnie.

306
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:08,341
Let's take this outside.
Mr. Koplovitz just got to sleep.

307
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:10,510
Sorry. She found us
this fantastic loft.

308
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:12,812
- Outside.
- It's not a loft, it's more urban.

309
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,874
Not that I'm urban, but I used to.
Two bedrooms.

310
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,951
Got wonderful views.
It's a really great place.

311
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,852
Procedure should take about an hour.

312
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:21,054
I'll be observing the entire time.

313
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:24,624
Maybe it'd be better
if you stayed with Ashley.

314
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,468
She's more scared than I am.

315
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,300
Well, she's...

316
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:31,764
At her age...

317
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,595
she's not supposed to be dealing
with issues of life and death.

318
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,245
Wasn't what I was planning
when I went after her.

319
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:42,265
Why did you leave Melissa?

320
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:44,388
We got married young.

321
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:45,485
We...

322
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:51,208
I'm not sure.

323
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,877
There's nothing to talk about.

324
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,508
Why are you doing surgery
when I need you finding me a new case?

325
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:15,810
<i>You don't want a new case.</i>

326
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,935
Oh, right.

327
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,219
Guess I'm here for Wilson.

328
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,517
Obviously you didn't tell me

329
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,395
that Cuddy was moving in with Lucas
'cause you were protecting me.

330
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,566
Which is odd since I told you
that I'm fine with their relationship.

331
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,235
So obviously,

332
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,446
you question one of those assumptions
or you have an issue with logic.

333
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,170
Yes, you're fine with them dating.

334
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:40,348
But moving in together

335
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:42,629
is a whole other level
of commitment.

336
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:44,789
This is the 21st century.

337
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:48,886
I realize that the logical course
of any adult relationship

338
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,153
could one day lead to fornication.

339
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:52,547
Although,

340
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:55,300
the fact
that she wants to buy a loft

341
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:59,220
could mean that their relationship
is not as serious as I thought.

342
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,331
For God's sake, House,
don't do this to yourself.

343
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:03,349
It's a loft.

344
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,519
It has no deeper meaning
than open-space living arrangement.

345
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,307
If you bought into her diatribe

346
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:11,274
about rediscovering
her lost city girl roots.

347
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,276
And two bedrooms.
It just reeks of commitment issues.

348
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:16,289
Yeah. Or she has a baby.

349
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:19,171
This is classic
mid-life Cuddy crisis.

350
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:22,205
This is her version
of a two-seat convertible.

351
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,329
Clearly you're fine with it.

352
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,414
<i>Wilson, he's got global lung damage.</i>

353
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,167
<i>Means it's not fungal.
It's PCP pneumonia.</i>

354
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,009
Obviously something

355
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,292
is knocking out his immune system.

356
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,065
Three options.
HIV. Acquired SCID.

357
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:47,568
Or my personal favorite, cancer.

358
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,591
I'm sure you'll test for all three.

359
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:00,972
62-year-old African-American man

360
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:02,992
with lymphoma now in remission.

361
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:06,976
I did a CT and found a small lesion
on the upper lobe of his left lung.

362
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:09,863
If he's in remission,
why did you bother scanning him?

363
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:13,044
During a routine follow-up,
I realized the patient was depressed.

364
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:15,755
That's quite a call.

365
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:19,821
The treatment indicate...

366
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:22,299
Oh, I'm sorry.

367
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:24,733
I didn't realize you were
in the middle of something.

368
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:26,458
It's a conference room

369
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,075
with glass walls.

370
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:30,103
You thought I'd be alone?

371
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,687
Your patient has cancer.

372
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:33,747
Not that guy.

373
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:36,859
He probably also has cancer.
And he's probably also your buddy.

374
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,039
Thought you'd want to know.

375
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:41,989
'Cause you owe me 100 bucks.

376
00:20:43,758 --> 00:20:44,784


377
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:48,247
You have acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.

378
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,256
A.L.L.

379
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:54,568
So it is a recurrence.

380
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,130
It's different.
It's a second leukemia.

381
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:00,175
Probably caused by the chemotherapy
we gave him five years ago.

382
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,085
That's why you didn't see it.

383
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,388
Maybe they can rename it
ironic leukemia.

384
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,779
This is not the end.

385
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:08,225
Tests show that the cancer
is limited to your brain.

386
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,186
- That's good news.
- How can cancer in his head be good?

387
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,975
The blood brain barrier separates

388
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,526
the blood in your head
from the blood in your body.

389
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,569
Keeps the cancer bottled up.

390
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,188
We can go for a cure.

391
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:22,531
So give me the numbers.

392
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,949
90% chance of cure.

393
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:27,498
Really?
What if we're in the 10%?

394
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,039
Steady decline.
But six months of a good quality life.

395
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:33,921
Does he have to go through
another bone marrow transplant?

396
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,920
Chemotherapy.
We can go at this with drugs alone.

397
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,590
When do we get started?

398
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:43,427
We begin by surgically planting a shunt
so the drugs go directly into the brain.

399
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,720
I booked the O.R.

400
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:47,657
You're the only one who can make cancer
sound like good news.

401
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:49,634
We get it out of your head
and you walk out

402
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,268
paralysis gone and cancer-free.

403
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,948
We also need you to sign
a health care proxy.

404
00:21:58,201 --> 00:21:59,736
If something goes wrong

405
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,883
someone needs
to make decisions for you.

406
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:03,660
What are the chances
of that happening?

407
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:04,686
Very remote.

408
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:06,967
I think maybe Melissa
should be my proxy.

409
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,203
What?
No.

410
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,143
Coming through.
House got a new case.

411
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:16,105
Revised O.R. schedule.
Sorry, Wilson, had to bump you.

412
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:19,856
- It's not like your guy's bleeding out.
- Your guy's not bleeding out.

413
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:21,810
The nurse who books the O.R.
thinks he is.

414
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:25,385
- Your case is no more urgent than mine.
- Yeah, but you're way more patient.

415
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,126
It's okay.

416
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:31,236
You can talk about the paperwork
in the prep area.

417
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:36,472
You trust her more than me.

418
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,539
About this, yes.

419
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:43,070
You've been through the good stuff,
but she's been to hell and back with me.

420
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:46,031
She gives me the best shot
of getting through this.

421
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:49,701
- You still love her.
- Don't be silly.

422
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,054
I love you.

423
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:53,288
Please...

424
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,415
don't make this
into more than it is.

425
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,414
- Anything?
- No.

426
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,503
- Can you feel this?
- No.

427
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,220
How about here?

428
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:13,888
Where is everybody?

429
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:16,388
Melissa and Emily went downstairs
to get some breakfast.

430
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:18,485
- Ashley?
- She had work to do.

431
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,399
I thought she was off today.

432
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:22,933
She didn't really have work to do.
She was pissed

433
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:24,846
so she pretended to have work to do.

434
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,321
I let her pretend.

435
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,399
Move your fingers.

436
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,962
- The chemo's not working.
- Does that mean it's not cancer?

437
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:45,520
No. It means the chemo
from your first round of treatment

438
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:47,259
has made the leukemia resistant.

439
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,846
So I'm in the 10%
that don't get cured.

440
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:55,462
Maybe not.

441
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,625
We just removed a screw
from a guy's lung.

442
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,523
And the weird thing is
he didn't get better.

443
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:05,669
- Any idea what that means?
- It means you're not listening to me.

444
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:08,555
No. It means I'm ignoring you
to make a point. There is a difference.

445
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,476
The problem is,
I have no idea what point you're making.

446
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,641
That your idea is implicitly
not worth responding to.

447
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:17,540
Doubling your patient's chemo dose
is stupid.

448
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:19,415
Damn. Now it's explicit.

449
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,082
It could swamp out the resistance
of the cancer cells.

450
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:25,164
The fact it theoretically should work
doesn't make it any less stupid.

451
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,486
Of course it does.

452
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:29,580
- It's exactly what you would do.
- I'm me. You're you.

453
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:34,090
And a table is a table.

454
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,292
And chemo is poison.

455
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:38,761
And double chemo is double poison.

456
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:41,441
I can handle it
when things go wrong.

457
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:42,566
You can't.

458
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:46,193
And things could go very,
very wrong.

459
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:49,663
I can handle it.

460
00:24:56,986 --> 00:24:58,576
Sounds pretty dangerous.

461
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,279
It is.

462
00:25:02,723 --> 00:25:04,256
What do you think, Mel?

463
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,356
I think you should call Ashley.

464
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:12,586
You're my family.

465
00:25:14,535 --> 00:25:16,123
I'm sorry I forgot that.

466
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,677
I think that you should try

467
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,940
whatever could keep you
with us longer.

468
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:58,077
- Look.
- I can move them.

469
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:04,369
What is it, Jim?

470
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:07,565
I'm gonna need to run some tests.

471
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,236
Intraepidermal superficial bullae.

472
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,702
- Could be Pemphigus.
- Or it could be from the fire.

473
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:15,198
Either way, he's dead.

474
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:17,367
We can't stop the oozing.

475
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:19,351
Don't care.

476
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,622
I'm here because it's 1:15

477
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:25,834
and Wilson started testing at 12:45.

478
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:28,964
- Which means...
- The cancer's gone.

479
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:31,506
But over half his hepatocytes
are dead.

480
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:34,793
In only 24 hours?

481
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:38,304
He needs a new liver.

482
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:42,957
Look on the bright side.

483
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,229
You can publish the results
of this case study.

484
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,314
No one will ever
double the dose again.

485
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:54,744
The double dose of chemo
got rid of your cancer.

486
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,443
But it also trashed your liver.

487
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:00,410
If I don't find you a new liver,

488
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,333
you've only got about 24 hours left.

489
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:08,035
So what do we do now?

490
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:13,423
Your father's been moved
to the top of the transplant list.

491
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,363
- But all we really can do is wait.
- That's it? We wait?

492
00:27:17,488 --> 00:27:20,072
- Tell me something that I can do.
- I'm sorry, Mel.

493
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:22,299
You and Emily don't match
Tuck's blood type.

494
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:23,725
And neither does Ashley.

495
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:27,053
So a live liver donation is out.

496
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:31,311
The best thing to do
is just what you've been doing.

497
00:27:32,004 --> 00:27:32,984
Be together.

498
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:41,307
Hope he already told you
that you're gonna die.

499
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:44,196
It's gonna make what I'm about to say
a lot more relevant.

500
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:47,271
I know it's raining
out there in the hallway, but...

501
00:27:47,396 --> 00:27:51,211
I was just in the ER testing my patient
for autonomic dysfunction.

502
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:54,309
It's the only department with a shower
big enough for the whole team,

503
00:27:54,434 --> 00:27:56,674
plus the cardiac monitors, plus me.

504
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,433
Anyway, relevant part,
we're just wheeling the guy out,

505
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:00,668
trauma came in.

506
00:28:00,793 --> 00:28:03,164
- Motorcycle versus semi.
- How bad?

507
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:05,475
Bad for the motorcycle.
Good for your liver.

508
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,435
- Blood type's match.
- Why wasn't I paged?

509
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:10,688
Because there's a problem.
No organ donor card.

510
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,108
Dead guy's sister is next of kin.
She's refusing to allow the donation.

511
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,402
- Where is she?
- 20 minutes away.

512
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:22,022
How do you get the call
that your brother's dead

513
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:23,493
and then run out the door?

514
00:28:24,478 --> 00:28:27,390
"That reminds me,
I had dry cleaning to pick up."

515
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:30,667
Did Cuddy buy the place?

516
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,036
Not yet.

517
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,593
- You okay?
- Just making conversation.

518
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:39,092
- Yours was getting boring.
- What are you planning?

519
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:41,719
- I'm not planning anything.
- And I don't believe you.

520
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,956
How are you gonna punish her
for dating Lucas?

521
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:46,407
Now this conversation
is getting boring.

522
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:49,686
Are you really OK?

523
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:52,682
I am not okay.

524
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:54,274
Not even close.

525
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:59,648
See, that's very adult of you.

526
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:01,239
No, it isn't.

527
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:05,553
It's just me accepting the fact that
there's nothing I can do and moving on.

528
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:08,663
Which is, I think,
the definition of adulthood.

529
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,165
If it is,
being a kid is a lot more fun.

530
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,085
Showtime.

531
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:24,887
I didn't speak to him for years.

532
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:27,642
But when my parents died,

533
00:29:28,228 --> 00:29:29,578
at their funeral,

534
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:31,767
we made peace.

535
00:29:32,995 --> 00:29:34,856
Our parents must've blessed it.

536
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:38,393
And I'm sure they would want him
to do good

537
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:40,153
with his last act in this world.

538
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,447
They wanted us to be friends.

539
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:47,178
Our relationship wasn't strong,
but it was growing.

540
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,246
If I allow you to defile his body,

541
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:52,498
it will destroy that bond.

542
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,500
The itai will be harmed.

543
00:29:54,914 --> 00:29:57,211
It will save my patient's life.

544
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,659
What if I told you...

545
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:06,220
that he wasn't dead?

546
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:08,890
Are you saying my brother
is still alive?

547
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,892
You're being an idiot.

548
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,233
I don't have time to talk you
out of your religion

549
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:15,136
so I'm stuck with giving you
a technicality

550
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:17,620
that will let you justify
doing the right thing.

551
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:22,361
What if his last living act
was to donate a part of his liver?

552
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,740
Not the whole thing,
just one small piece.

553
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,826
Then I'm not defiling a dead body.

554
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,705
The last generous act
of a living person.

555
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,035
It's too late.

556
00:30:36,162 --> 00:30:38,089
The liver started to degrade.

557
00:30:38,214 --> 00:30:40,421
It's no longer viable
for transplant.

558
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,510
Well played.

559
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:47,595
Religion killed another person.

560
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,479
It's not fair, Jim.

561
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:01,400
You just helped me
get my family back together.

562
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:06,873
I'm not ready.

563
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,582
I would've had six more months with them
if you hadn't given me that extra chemo.

564
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:18,934
Now I have less than one day.

565
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,171
I'm sorry.
We knew the risks.

566
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,257
I don't want to lose them again.

567
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:26,551
I can't lose them again.

568
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:30,938
There's nothing more we can do.

569
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:36,593
Five years ago,
when I needed a transfusion,

570
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,010
you used your own blood.

571
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,440
We have the same type.

572
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,610
Which means you can give me
a part of your liver.

573
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,838
- I'm your doctor.
- You're my friend.

574
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:52,648
Should I die
because you're also my doctor?

575
00:31:52,773 --> 00:31:54,537
- Of course not.
- Then. You're fired.

576
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,696
Now you're just my friend.

577
00:31:57,802 --> 00:31:59,371
Now you can do what's right.

578
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,920
Tucker, it's...

579
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:05,466
I can't.

580
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,686
Late night with the Pigeon sisters?

581
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:20,679
Every now and again,

582
00:32:20,804 --> 00:32:23,668
I'd like to come home
without getting interrogated.

583
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,372
Someone's cranky.

584
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:29,196
And late.

585
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:30,719
Where were you?

586
00:32:30,844 --> 00:32:32,394
Just getting a drink.

587
00:32:33,142 --> 00:32:35,411
Why are all my frozen dinners
thawing on the counter?

588
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:38,748
I needed room
for my margarita jell-o shots.

589
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,208
I use test tubes as bottles

590
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,355
so they'll be shaped like my cane.

591
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:49,017
Why'd you go out drinking alone
when you got such great company here?

592
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,519
Tucker wants me to donate
a lobe of my liver to him.

593
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:00,619
And you were out drinking.

594
00:33:01,535 --> 00:33:03,679
So you're actually considering this?

595
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,834
Yeah. I was out marinating
my liver in alcohol

596
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,111
to get it ready for the transplant.

597
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:11,381
Your mouth says no,

598
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,508
but your pathetic attempt
at a deflection

599
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:15,336
has guilt written all over it.

600
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:18,329
It's my fault.
It is my fault!

601
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:21,832
- I gave him too much chemo.
- You cured his cancer.

602
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,002
- Killed him in the process.
- Quibbles.

603
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:28,923
He's had a predictable complication.

604
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:32,051
Surprise. Bad things
happen to people who are sick.

605
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,802
Doesn't make you responsible.

606
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:37,056
No... not legally.
Ethically.

607
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:39,850
- Ethically!
- A table is a table.

608
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,313
Don't be a doormat.

609
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:46,315
Boy, you are...
you willfully ruined my food

610
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:50,411
and have taken over my living room
because you already think I'm a doormat!

611
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:51,836
You know what...

612
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:57,955
you're wrong.

613
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:01,619
You... clean up your stuff
and get out.

614
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:07,011
You're wrong.

615
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:15,721
How's Tucker?

616
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,941
Still not dancing.

617
00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:21,302
But scans came in on Del Clinton.

618
00:34:21,558 --> 00:34:23,578
- It's good news.
- Thanks.

619
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,730
Let me know as soon as Tucker
takes a turn for the worse.

620
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,348
I want to be there.

621
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,331
See that small spot
at the top of the lung?

622
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:38,752
That was then.
This is now.

623
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:40,211
Spot's gone.

624
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,219
That tiny little spot?

625
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,855
It's not too impressive, is it?

626
00:34:48,257 --> 00:34:50,557
That little dot could've killed me?

627
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:54,655
Fortunately, we caught it early.

628
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,224
It's gonna be okay.

629
00:34:57,649 --> 00:34:58,899
That's amazing.

630
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,017
You got all this off me
not talking about my grandkids.

631
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:11,523
Thanks, Bonnie.

632
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,822
Just gonna have to sit tight
for a while.

633
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,622
I put an offer on the loft.
Seller turned me down.

634
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,726
I offered exactly what a similar
unit sold for three months ago.

635
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:34,006
I want to donate a lobe
of my liver to Tucker.

636
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:39,468
- That's insane.
- I'm donating a small portion of...

637
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:41,513
You have hundreds of patients.

638
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:44,146
And until I run out
of excess organs,

639
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:46,310
why shouldn't I do everything
I can to help them?

640
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,936
Because you're a doctor,

641
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:49,498
not a donor.

642
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,530
Why did you make me
the head of oncology?

643
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:00,982
Not because you have
the most organs.

644
00:36:02,487 --> 00:36:04,411
You're thoughtful, caring.

645
00:36:06,156 --> 00:36:07,006
Caring.

646
00:36:07,658 --> 00:36:09,917
By your own criteria
a strength and not a weakness.

647
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:12,169
This is coming out of guilt.

648
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,088
This is coming out of friendship.

649
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,881
I have a friend who's about to die.

650
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,218
And I have the opportunity
to save his life.

651
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:42,475
Call me a doormat,
get it all out of your system...

652
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,950
but I'm doing it.

653
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:49,505
Why?

654
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:53,001
He's my friend.

655
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,878
I'm your friend.

656
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,460
All the pain pills I've taken.

657
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,843
- What if I need your liver?
- Right.

658
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:04,907
How selfish of me not to have
considered your possible future needs.

659
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,643
They're all dying.
They're all your friends.

660
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,351
I'm not here for an argument.

661
00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:11,019
No. Right.
That's room 12A.

662
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:14,958
So why are you here?

663
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,512
Wanna make sure
that I called the moving van?

664
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,039
The operation is in two hours,

665
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:25,261
and I'd like you
to be there with me.

666
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:35,627
Why?

667
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,708
Because if you die, I'm alone.

668
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,894


669
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:44,909
How you feeling?

670
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:48,355
Can't complain considering
if it weren't for you, I'd be dead...

671
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,280
twice.

672
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,841
You?

673
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:52,805
I feel good.

674
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,268
Sending out your laundry?

675
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:58,896
Going to rehab.
Some place up in Katonah.

676
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:02,889
Up by your new house,
not near your old house.

677
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:05,987
Easier on Ashley.

678
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:08,873
I see.

679
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:13,763
I was thrilled to get
the family back together

680
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:15,663
and Melissa's great in a crisis,

681
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:19,428
but the person you want
when you're dying

682
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,794
isn't the same as the person
you want when you're living.

683
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,811
Actually, it's James.

684
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,369
You ready to admit
that he's a self-important jerk?

685
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:59,322
I still feel good about what I did.

686
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:01,952
You don't feel angry?

687
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:06,005
I'm a little disappointed.

688
00:41:08,244 --> 00:41:10,494
Disappointment is anger for wimps.

689
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,374
You don't have to be so gentle
about everything.

690
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,559
It's okay to get angry
once in a while.

691
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,216
You can't change a table.

692
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,515
Actually, you can.

693
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,524
Just need a coat of paint
and the guts to use it.

694
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:15,533
Bonnie told me what Cuddy bid.

695
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,618
You're gonna outbid her?

696
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:23,833
We do need a bigger refrigerator.

697
00:42:27,372 --> 00:42:30,339
She hurt my friend.
She should be punished.

698
00:42:31,475 --> 00:42:32,575
You got mad.

699
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:35,161
I'm proud of you.

700
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:38,450
Cuddy won't share that sentiment.

701
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,016
How are you gonna explain it to her?

702
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,288
I'm changing our address
to a p.o. box.

703
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:45,855
She'll find out eventually.

704
00:42:46,494 --> 00:42:47,868
A problem delayed...

705
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:50,484
is a problem denied.

706
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:56,624
I'll take it.

707
00:42:57,686 --> 00:42:58,909
Baby steps.

708
00:43:01,474 --> 00:43:04,128
