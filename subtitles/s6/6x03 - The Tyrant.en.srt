We will anger the Americans,

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,588
slipping out like this.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,056
If your son was a student

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,494
at one of the greatest
universities in the world...

5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,216
So make him come to you.

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,811
You're protected near the U.N.

7
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:17,370
Once we cross 42nd street...

8
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,894
As always, I appreciate
your caution, Joseph,

9
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,731
but, as always,
you have far too much of it.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,687
Stay down, sir.

11
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:54,172
Get on the ground.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,352
Get on the ground.

Your boss is being sued under title 18

crimes against humanity,

18
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:09,567
and torture.

Mr. President.

20
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:18,383
This is only a civil lawsuit.

21
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:19,858
We can ignore it.

22
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:28,393

27
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:09,239
{\pos(192,220)}He is setting up interviews
to replace Taub and Thirteen,

28
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:10,896
{\pos(192,220)}but it might take a couple of weeks.

29
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:12,397
{\pos(192,220)}What happened to them?

30
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,523
{\pos(192,220)}He quit, and I had to let her go.

31
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:17,760
You actually fired your girlfriend?

32
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,848
You{\ two} are both competent,
and I know I can work with you.

33
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,933
You really do know how to woo.

34
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:24,268
I need you.

35
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,605
{\pos(192,230)}It would be interesting.
We could work together.

36
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,648
Did you see who the patient is?

37
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,761
{\pos(192,230)}That's one of the reasons
it'll be interesting.

38
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:34,779
{\pos(192,230)}Dibala is one of the most repressive
dictators in the world.

39
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,906
You had no problem treating
a guy on death row.

40
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,727
{\pos(192,230)}Who was still in prison{\ after we patched him up}.

41
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:41,452
{\pos(192,230)}We fix Dibala, he gets on a plane
and executes half his country.

42
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:45,455
{\pos(192,220)}He's been repressing an ethnic rebellion
in the south, the Sitibi people.

43
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:47,708
{\pos(192,220)}It's getting worse.

44
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,187
{\pos(192,220)}Dibala is a guest
of the U.S. Government.

45
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:52,562
{\pos(192,220)}And he's been invited
to speak at the U.N.

46
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:55,939
{\pos(192,220)}I'm not asking you to love him.
I'm asking you to do your job.

47
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,286
{\pos(192,220)}Utterly incomprehensible.

48
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,626
{\pos(192,220)}And, of course, I'm talking
about you firing your girlfriend.

49
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,752
{\pos(192,220)}We weren't getting along
with her working under me.

- Cameron and I work together.

51
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,648
{\pos(192,220)}But you weren't her boss.
And you stopped working together.

52
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:13,557
{\pos(192,220)}Why don't you just tell her
you were wrong?

53
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:15,032
{\pos(192,220)}Because I wasn't.

54
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:16,570
{\pos(192,220)}I know how this looks.

55
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:18,666
I know it might break us up.

56
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,726
But that's better
than definitely breaking us up,

57
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:23,023
{\pos(192,220)}which is what would
have happened otherwise.

58
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,846
Hemorrhagic ulcers in the lungs.

59
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,399
Oh, my God,

60
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:34,074
it's three years ago.

61
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,590
Does that mean I'm still crazy?

62
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,050
- You're back?
- You look good.

63
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:42,465
{\pos(192,220)}- We're just helping out because...
- I know. I just ran into Thirteen

64
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,591
{\pos(192,220)}while she was clearing out
her locker.

65
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:45,903
{\pos(192,220)}My condolences.

66
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:48,435
{\pos(192,220)}Although it's not like
she's the hottest woman in the world.

67
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,091
{\pos(192,220)}We haven't broken up.

68
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,064
{\pos(192,220)}- Are you back?
- Sort of.

69
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,611
{\pos(192,220)}- Did you get your license back?
- Not for a month or so.

70
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:57,862
{\pos(192,220)}So you'll be in charge.
I'm just gonna pitch in a little.

71
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,740
Dibala thinks
it was an assassination attempt.

72
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,248
{\pos(192,220)}Polonium,
like the Russian in London.

73
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,469
{\pos(192,220)}FBI checked the service
of process forms and his hotel room.

74
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,173
{\pos(192,220)}No radioactivity trails.

75
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,331
Acid reflux?

76
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,041
No history of asthma or heartburn.

77
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:15,345
{\pos(192,200)}He has a bug bite on his hands.
Malaria's endemic in his country.

78
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,089
{\pos(192,200)}Let's start him on coartem.

79
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,720
{\pos(192,220)}I don't want to step on any toes,

80
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:27,756
{\pos(192,220)}but {\I guess }I do have a higher duty
to the patient.

81
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,725
{\pos(192,220)}- If you have something to say, say it.
- You're rushing to a diagnosis

82
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,355
{\pos(192,220)}because you're rushing out of this room
because you're {\rightly }upset with me.

83
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,055
{\pos(192,220)}Although I wasn't the one
who made that asinine decision.

84
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,110
Do you have anything medical to say?

85
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:41,541
{\pos(192,220)}Poison fits better
because of the vomiting.

86
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,227
Bug bite might not be a bite.

87
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:44,916
It might be the start of chloracne.

88
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,638
Assassination attempt
through dioxin poisoning.

89
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,954
It's hard to detect.

90
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,433
Fits.

91
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,596
Start him on olestra.

92
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,426
You couldn't have just said
dioxin up front?

93
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:05,470
I was hoping you'd get there
on your own.

94
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,297
So I guess we should talk to Cuddy.

95
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:16,467
You are sure it is dioxin?

96
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,424
It's our best guess.

97
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:25,199
The olestra here binds to the poison
and flushes it out of your system.

98
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:27,743
- Where are you from, doctor?
- I'm Australian.

99
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,328
Do I hear a bit of the british?

100
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,114
Most people don't notice it.

101
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,177
Yeah, I kicked
around there for a while.

102
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,126
You went to medical school there?

103
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,928
Actually a year of seminary.

104
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:39,203
And you left.

105
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,430
There was a catholic mission
near my childhood village.

106
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,846
I liked the priests.
They were good people.

107
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:50,849
But when my two younger sisters

108
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:53,409
were dying from consumption,

109
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,010
it wasn't more priests we wanted.

110
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,863
I fired my girlfriend
because he said he was gone for good.

111
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,891
I need this in my life.

112
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:10,563
A week ago,
it was the last thing you needed.

113
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:12,538
It's a process.
I'm learning.

114
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,051
- And screwing me over as you go.
- Yeah, that's why I did it.

115
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:18,897
Sorry.

116
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:21,438
If you want,
I'll explain it to Thirteen.

117
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:22,548
He's not ready.

118
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,926
- He doesn't have his license.
- Then he can't practice.

119
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,503
But we'd be idiots
not to listen to him.

120
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,391
You're in charge,
he sits in on all the differentials.

121
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,691
Until you get your license back,
this is all unofficial.

122
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:37,980
No procedures, no patient contact.

123
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,525
Think I can probably deal
with that last one.

124
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:49,659
The only reason I let you go

125
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,062
is because our relationship
wouldn't work if I was in charge.

126
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,913
But I won't be in charge soon, so...

127
00:06:57,988 --> 00:06:59,793
I came to offer you
your old job back.

128
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:02,921
I know. I look bad.

129
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,206
But circumstances have changed.

130
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,448
- I don't want the job.
- Why not?

131
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:11,793
Because there's a much simpler
explanation for you firing me.

132
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:15,322
You wanted to break up with me,
but you were too weak to do it yourself.

133
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,144
Then why would I try
to hire you back?

134
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,648
Can we please

135
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
get some dinner tonight?

136
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:22,789
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,282
You're a follow-up?

138
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,917
You must not treat him.

139
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:38,832
Dibala killed my wife.

140
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:42,513
She was a trade unionist.

141
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,880
He took her

142
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,716
from our home...
while I was at work.

143
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:50,928
- Who took her?
- Dibala's youth labor league.

144
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,148
He pretends it's to get
young people off the street.

145
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,518
But he takes teenage boys
from the provinces

146
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:00,104
and feeds them drugs and alcohol

147
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:02,936
and teaches them how to torture.

148
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,976
They dumped her body in my yard
two weeks later.

149
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:09,863
They raped her.

150
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,567
They carved <i>inyenzi</i>,

151
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:13,787
cockroach,

152
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,401
onto her stomach

153
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:16,953
because she's Sitibi.

154
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,841
I'm very sorry,
but I can't discuss other patients.

155
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,579
You should talk to a lawyer,
talk to the U.N...

156
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,456
So they can sit and watch,
like they did in Rwanda?

157
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:29,193
There are 2 million Sitibi.

158
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,093
He's planning to massacre them all.

159
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,908
His radio stations
are talking about a final war

160
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,766
to exterminate the cockroaches.

161
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,197
He can't recover.

162
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,626
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,643
How was your first day of school?

164
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:58,036
Didn't pee once in the sandbox.

165
00:08:58,302 --> 00:08:59,529
How was it with Cuddy?

166
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:01,516
What did you think
I was talking about?

167
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,517
You didn't use garlic.

168
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,062
You didn't use it last night either.

169
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,626
We always use garlic
on chicken Florentine.

170
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,133
It tastes fine this way.

171
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,461
You seem to be losing
your sense of smell.

172
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,637
I think you're losing
your sense of mind.

173
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,110
I can check right now
if you pull my finger.

174
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,643
No, it's the...

175
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:26,732
Are you inventing
some big medical mystery here?

176
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,981
Because if you're imagining
things again...

177
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:31,153
You weren't wearing shoes
last night either.

178
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:34,900
Yes, shoes,

179
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,226
garlic...

180
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:37,907
I am vampire, Sookie.

181
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,962
I told you to get that echo fixed.

182
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,673
My downstairs neighbor,
after you moved in,

183
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:55,829
started complaining about the{\ extra} noise
and the cooking smells.

184
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:59,050
- What's his name?
- I don't want you making things worse.

185
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:02,178
He's on the condo board, and I'm trying
to get the back garden renovated.

186
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:05,646
The white coats taught me a whole bunch
of fun coping and relating skills.

187
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:09,742
He's not only a total jerk,
he's a decorated war hero

188
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,717
who lost an arm in Vietnam.

189
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,321
I mean, there's no winning
with this guy.

190
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,435
Coping skill number one...

191
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,010
complete avoidance.

192
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:20,226
You happy?

193
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:22,743
Booty call?

194
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:24,706
Give me 20 minutes to not shower.

195
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,013
- Patient's having a heart attack.
- Mask at 15, ladies.

196
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:28,877
Just thought you'd like to know.

197
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:30,754
Start of intravenous. Heparin.{\pub}

198
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:37,887
Lassa fever.

199
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:43,059
You were mad {\that }I withheld it last time,
so I'm saying it right up front.

200
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,649
He's already stabilized,

201
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:47,456
so 40 ccs of ribavirin,

202
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,231
and we're home in time for <i>Ellen</i>.

203
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,734
I checked. There's no Lassa
in Dibala's country.

204
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,267
The rash is gone.
It rules out your dioxin theory.

205
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,740
He's running a {\slight }fever,
which we can add to the heart,

206
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,326
- plus the lung ulcers.
- Ebola? Marburg?

207
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,150
Too long an incubation period.

208
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,798
Don't people sometimes travel?

209
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:06,963
To places that have,
you know, a fever

210
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:09,502
that originated
in the Nigerian town of Lassa?

211
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,901
He's been to three other countries
in the last two years:

212
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:14,325
here, Zimbabwe,
and Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

213
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,982
No Lassa there either.

214
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:17,718
Again.

215
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,088
Trypanosomiasis?

216
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:20,652
No sleep disturbances.

217
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:23,599
But fits best with the symptoms.
And it's geographically the most...

218
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:24,642
What?

219
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:27,216
The Egypt visit
was for the African union meeting,

220
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:30,223
where I'm guessing
he was meeting people from Africa.

221
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:33,651
Which includes Liberia, which sent
some members of their foreign ministry,

222
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,845
which has itself just been hit
by an outbreak of jock itch.

223
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,720
No, wait.
Not jock itch.

224
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,223
Lassa fever.

225
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:44,285
I'll start the ribavirin.

226
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:47,164
I did say it up front.

227
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:50,190
It's great to have the old team
back together again, huh?

228
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:58,676
Yesterday, it's poisoning.
Today, Lassa fever.

229
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:01,137
- Maybe a specialist...
- Joseph!

230
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:02,763
Leave him alone.

231
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:06,601
These people
know what they are doing.

232
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:09,979
Are you married, doctor?

233
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:13,216
You have a girlfriend.

234
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,862
Judging by your tentative answer

235
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,431
and the complicated expression
on her face,

236
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:25,092
I believe that is she,
standing in the hallway.

237
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,450
I got a call from Douglas' department
at Princeton general.

238
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:36,297
They want me to interview with them.

239
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,966
Which is weird, because when I called
last week {\they said }they had nothing available.

240
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,760
So I never sent in my resume.

241
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,890
- Douglas owes me a favor.
- Most people send chocolates.

242
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:48,066
I'd stand outside your apartment
all night

243
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,436
holding up a boom box,
{\except }but you {\ told me you }hate '80s music.

244
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,794
So, about dinner...

245
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:00,894
I'm free tomorrow night.

246
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,492
I was wondering what that noise was.

247
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:28,057
It's the damn cane.

248
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,558
And I'm Greg.

249
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,019
{\And }I can't sleep with you
banging around with that thing.

250
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:36,774
You're not actually saying
that I have too loud a cane?

251
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:38,898
Is that hard for you to understand?

252
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,779
{\Only in the sense that }It has a rubber tip on the end,

253
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,072
{\and }not a tap shoe.

254
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,074
Now you're getting cute with me.

255
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:47,556
Okay, we started badly.

256
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:50,598
I apologize for the noise,

257
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:52,790
and we{\ will}'ll {\try to }figure out
a way to be quieter.

258
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,261
And a thousand other things
I don't give a crap about.

259
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:58,216
Now you keep it down,
or we're gonna have trouble.

260
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,812
You paged me?

261
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,559
This is Ama.

262
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:16,480
She is from our country,
but she lives here now.

263
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,607
We'd like you to use her blood.

264
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:19,978
For what?

265
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:22,903
She recovered from Lassa fever
two years ago.

266
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:26,170
Our health minister has advised us

267
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:29,285
that plasma from one
who has the antibodies

268
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:31,832
is much more effective
than ribavirin.

269
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,706
This is a signed consent form.

270
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:36,621
Will you take her blood, please?

271
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,308
I want to do this.

272
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,175
You understand{\ that} we would be using

273
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,012
your blood to cure president Dibala.

274
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
I know.

275
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,390
Are you from the Sitibi people?

276
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,810
I am Sitibi.

277
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,212
Did they threaten you{\ in some way}?

278
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:57,362
- Your family members back home?
- Please let me give the blood.

279
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:58,629
Please.

280
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:01,783
Do it.

281
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:04,320
She's being coerced.

282
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,488
If she is,

283
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,452
I'd rather have a needle prick
on my conscience

284
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:10,492
than the death
of her family members.

285
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:40,741
Don't let him in there!

286
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,118
That's enough!
We got him!

287
00:15:57,361 --> 00:15:59,750
- You all right?
- Who is that man?

288
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:07,549
He shot him?

289
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,513
{\pub}

290
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:15,899
You need a lawyer.

291
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:18,102
{\pos(192,220)}You can get a court-appointed.

292
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,520
{\pos(192,220)}They can help you.

293
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,105
{\pos(192,220)}I can't be helped.

294
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:24,817
{\pos(192,220)}You did a stupid, terrible thing.

295
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,820
{\pos(192,220)}But given the circumstances
with your wife,

296
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,510
{\pos(192,220)}you could get a reduced sentence.

297
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,890
She wasn't my wife.

298
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:38,872
{\Then }Who was she?

299
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:42,024
They never told us her name.

300
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:48,616
What this men...

301
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:51,187
made us do to that woman...

302
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,737
He is now going to do...

303
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:58,919
to all the Sitibi.

304
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:04,874
- You could've{\ have} got{\ten} killed.
- He wasn't gonna hurt me.

305
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,900
He fired a gun in the hospital!

306
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:09,736
Come here.

307
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:18,412
Maybe next time
don't yell out that warning.

308
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,914
The bloody eye
was from an enlarged lymph node

309
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,378
blocking the retinal vein.

310
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:28,363
We restored circulation,
but it means

311
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:32,275
we've got to add lymph involvement
to the heart, lungs, and rising fever.

312
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:35,327
I'm just gonna sit here quietly.

313
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Why?

314
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,262
I feel like I've been{\ inadvertently} undermining
your authority

315
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:42,187
So I'm just gonna observe.

316
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,862
Not gonna say a word.

317
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:48,617
The heart could point
to sarcoidosis.

318
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:57,488
I'm thinking the X-rays indicate

319
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,866
a lack of hilar adenopathy,
which rules it out.

320
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,124
Staph aureus?

321
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,521
Because...

322
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,401
He...

323
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,156
smokes?

324
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,472
He's miming a thermometer.
He says the fever's not high enough.

325
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:23,268
- So some other infection.
- He's wrong!

326
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,112
The fever could be misleading us
into thinking infection.

327
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,691
Talk!

328
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,780
It could{\ all} fit with lymphoma.

329
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:43,956
I need you to spread your legs
so I can do an h.

330
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:46,252
Can't be lymphoma.

331
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,740
LDH is normal.

332
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,339
He's got good liver function.
It's masking the elevated levels.

333
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:53,840
Biopsy the lymph node.

334
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,159
Check it out.

335
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:57,898
Makes sense.

336
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:01,083
I guess you don't need me.

337
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,734
By the way,

338
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,974
you might wanna close the blinds.

339
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:08,799
A little bright in here.

340
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,774
It's just a wild coincidence
that he thought you were a rude jerk.

341
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,246
{\Come on. }Give me the benefit of the doubt.
You said he's a jerk. I barely talked.

342
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,464
You talked!

343
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,589
All I wanted was to sip
morning espresso

344
00:19:30,714 --> 00:19:32,741
next to a peaceful,
burbling fountain.

345
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:35,522
You could be sipping Courvoisier

346
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:37,775
next to a replica
of the Playboy grotto

347
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,602
if you tell him what you got on him.

348
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:41,305
I don't have anything on him.

349
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:42,723
I don't want anything{\ on him}!

350
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,031
The closest he's been to Vietnam?

351
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:48,206
Ordering the Mee krob
at that place on the corner.

352
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:51,000
- Mee krob is from Thailand.
- Exactly.

353
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,342
What did you do?

354
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,735
- Why do you think he's faking?
- I saw his mail.

355
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,503
- Your broke in?
- No. He was holding it.

356
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,240
Private medical insurance.

357
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:00,899
Not from the V.A.

358
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:03,904
Plus, he's got to be early 50s.

359
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:05,275
{\He's }Too young to be a vet.

360
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,498
- So I looked further.
- You did break in.

361
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,666
Online.

362
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,375
{\There's }No reference to him
in{\ any of} the vet records.

363
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:14,727
- Why would he fake being a veteran?
- Just look how you're acting.

364
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,508
People have been tiptoeing around
this jerk for years.

365
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,295
Normally, we'd all tell the amputee
to go screw himself.

366
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,306
Victims get pity, heroes get adulation.
It's way better!

367
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,541
Thank you for {\ trying to }helping me out
with my neighbor.

368
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,241
- Now forget the Vietnam stuff.
- I could prove this.

369
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,342
{\But }You won't because you'll be{\ too} busy
writing him a letter of apology.

370
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:34,041
And dropping it at his door.

371
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,757
Without knocking at his door.

372
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:38,373
I didn't do anything.
That guy is a total ass!

373
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:39,655
{\Which is}It's the point.

374
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,720
It's easy to be nice
to people you like.

375
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:43,667
But being nice to people you hate,

376
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,981
that's a skill.

377
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:46,107
Do it.

378
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:52,926
Thank you for saving my life.

379
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:55,754
The man that tried to kill you,

380
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:58,173
he said that you were preparing
a massacre.

381
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:04,975
The Sitibi are my countrymen.

382
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,113
I am fighting a guerrilla war.

383
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,728
In a way
that's being called genocide.

384
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,600
20 years ago,

385
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:17,111
these same Sitibi rebels
took over the south,

386
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,906
They massacred tens of thousands,

387
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:22,081
and they would{\ happily} do it again!

388
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:24,545
I'm trying to impose order.

389
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,312
I'm trying to prevent

390
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:29,246
a genocide.

391
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:30,467
Genocide.

392
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:33,630
My own son,

393
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,486
my youngest,

394
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,161
he is a student here.

395
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:39,507
He hasn't spoken to me in years

396
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,167
because of what he read
in your newspapers.

397
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,075
But what he read is not true.

398
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:47,431
What about your youth labor league?

399
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,066
There...

400
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:56,495
I was at fault.

401
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,877
I hired men, who, in their zeal,

402
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:02,602
stepped over the line.

403
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,700
And there were abuses.

404
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,344
But that will not happen again.

405
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:58,669
Hello?

406
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:32,916
How's it going?

407
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,691
Normal-looking nucleus.

408
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,373
How's it going with you?

409
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:39,590
It worried me when you joked about
letting that man shoot Dibala.

410
00:23:39,715 --> 00:23:41,015
I wasn't joking.

411
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:44,005
You can't want to kill anyone.

412
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,948
- Especially not your own patient.
- It's{\ only} natural to feel he should...

413
00:23:47,073 --> 00:23:48,782
No, it's completely unnatural.

414
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:51,755
Only psychopaths can kill{\ other people}
without having {\some sort of}a breakdown.

415
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,765
Not when it's justified
Look at soldiers.

416
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,475
Even when it's justified.

417
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:58,781
Am I trying to kill our patient?
Of course not.

418
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:00,841
But if he died,
am I supposed to{\ just} pretend

419
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:02,850
that wouldn't be good for the world?

420
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:05,819
The cells are neatly differentiated.

421
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:08,087
This isn't lymphoma.

422
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,257
Thought I had detected

423
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:14,782
the sickly sweet smell
of maple syrup

424
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:16,607
and socialized medicine.

425
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:18,546
It smells like...

426
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,599
victory.

427
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:23,253
That big flag in your place

428
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,636
prompted me to chat
with your housekeeper.

429
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:28,217
Turns out you're a citizen
of the Great White North.

430
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,020
- You broke into my apartment?
- Technically, no.

431
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:32,417
Well...

432
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,723
technically, yeah, but two steps.

433
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,439
- Hardly...
- You're going to jail.

434
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:39,059
Speaking of... You know
what can get you six months

435
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:40,684
and a $100,000 fine?

436
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:44,024
Falsely claiming that you won a medal
in Vietnam.

437
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:47,901
- You think I'm faking?
- Canada did not send troops{\ to fight} in Vietnam,

438
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:49,026
you idiot.

439
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,045
They sent troops

440
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:55,808
to reinforce the '73 peace accords.

441
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:59,039
Which is where I tried to free
a 12-year-old boy

442
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:01,136
who stepped on a land mine.

443
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,919
36 years later, every second,
I feel pain in my hand

444
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,547
like I'm still grabbing his{\that boy's} arm,
even though my arm isn't there.

445
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:09,269
So, no.

446
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:11,143
I'm not faking.

447
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,210
On a related note...

448
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,120
Go Maple Leaves!

449
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,321
Did you get the biopsy results?

450
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,239
Is it lymphoma?

451
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:35,003
{\pos(192,230)}So we have to move on.

452
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:37,515
{\pos(192,230)}Infection, perhaps autoimmune.

453
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,621
{\pos(192,230)}Did you get the biopsy results?

454
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,185
{\pos(192,230)}Yes, I just told you.

455
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,797
{\pos(192,230)}Is it lymphoma?

456
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,531
Cameron and Chase?

457
00:25:50,064 --> 00:25:52,050
They both really like diagnostics,

458
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,220
and I think they both really like
watching House torture me.

459
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:58,848
Anyway, thank you for understanding
about the job.

460
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,104
I had two really
crappy alternatives.

461
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:08,778
- There was a third.
- What's that?

462
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:11,486
You could have stepped aside.

463
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,365
We both would have lost our jobs.

464
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:16,936
You could've{\ have} asked Cameron
or Chase to take your place.

465
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:18,257
They wouldn't have{\ wanted to}.

466
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:20,620
You just said they both
really like diagnostics.

467
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,689
- You want to go back in time?
- I want to make this work.

468
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:28,661
I want to understand you.

469
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:31,236
I mean, you know
how you made me feel.

470
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:34,907
If you could do it again...

471
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:38,741
I made the right decision.

472
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,250
I need your confidential
medical opinion.

473
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:58,459
Is the president capable
of thinking clearly?

474
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,030
Obviously not, right now.

475
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:03,961
Will he ever be?

476
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:07,269
I think...

477
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,337
Neurons don't grow back,
and he's already in his decline.

478
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:15,842
Anything he tells you, any command
he gives, how will you ever know

479
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,227
it's not{\ just} the delusions of a sick
mad, dying old man?

480
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,207
<i>He just started spiking a fever.</i>

481
00:27:36,343 --> 00:27:37,693
It's scleroderma.

482
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,035
You don't have some clever way
of telling me this time?

483
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,872
Patient's dying.
I'm done with clever.

484
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:48,081
Look at his skin.
It's tight for a 75-year-old.

485
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:49,884
Based on his admission photo?

486
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:51,259
Bit subjective.

487
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:54,361
Fever points to infection.
Now he's got nodules on his fingers.

488
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,736
- That's blastomycosis.
- Nodules?

489
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,410
And you're calling tight skin
subjective?

490
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:02,114
I'm with Foreman. We would've seen
fungus balls on the head CT.

491
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,723
Fungal lesions can be missed.

492
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,102
We could settle this with a test.
Anticentromere antibody would point it.

493
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,296
Point to, not prove.
And his fever's too high.

494
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,408
- We have to treat him now.
- We treat wrong,

495
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,817
we could send this disease
into overdrive.

496
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,984
- You're with me on the scleroderma.
- I guess.

497
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:18,863
I {\just}don't care enough about the patient
to waste my time {\trying}to convince anyone.

498
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,282
{\You don't like himthe guy,}You didn't want
to work on this case,

499
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,874
and yet you're still here.
Why don't you take a stand?

500
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,621
{\either}Do something about it or shut up.

501
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,543
Treat him for blasto if you want.

502
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:31,384
I'll get Cuddy.
I can convince her...

503
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,296
This isn't a democracy.
I don't care who you get.

504
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:37,150
At least for right now,
this is my department.

505
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,552
We're treating him for blasto.
Start him on Amphotericin B.

506
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:53,148
If you inject my I.V.
with an air bubble...

507
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:55,926
- What are you doing?
- I'll have another heart attack.

508
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:58,184
- No one will know.
- Let her go.

509
00:28:58,526 --> 00:29:02,375
You tell my colonel, I'm a sick,
dying old man who can't be trusted.

510
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,510
I didn't say...

511
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:07,696
You were trying to put a gun in his hand
and point it at my head.

512
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:09,977
The gun is now in your hand.

513
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:12,892
That is a practical difference,
not a moral one.

514
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:15,628
If you want me dead,
then pull the trigger.

515
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,160
It is not so easy when you have
to do it yourself.

516
00:29:47,716 --> 00:29:49,816
I guess I didn't want you dead.

517
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:59,750
You touch my wife again,
I'll kick your ass out into the street.

518
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:02,718
- I don't care who you are.
- I did her a favor.

519
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,178
I showed her her true character.

520
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:07,804
She's a better person than you are.

521
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:10,418
She is too weak to act
on her beliefs.

522
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:14,285
But that is not her fault.
Most everyone is.

523
00:30:14,894 --> 00:30:16,444
Even my own advisors.

524
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:18,037
My own colonel.

525
00:30:19,623 --> 00:30:22,741
All they do is negotiate and debate

526
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,985
and sign treaties.

527
00:30:25,414 --> 00:30:26,864
They are appeasers.

528
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,650
And all the while,
we are beset by assassins

529
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:31,664
and traitors, the scum...

530
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,140
Cockroaches?

531
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:37,919
What are you going to do about them?

532
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,050
What is an enemy to you?

533
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:44,437
Some younger physician
who covets your office?

534
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:46,600
In my world,

535
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:50,432
there are dangers
and bloodshed and death.

536
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,767
And that makes you a man.

537
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,251
And men make choices.

538
00:30:56,192 --> 00:31:00,284
And your choice is to send bands
of drunk, crazed children

539
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,486
to massacre an entire people?

540
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:05,576
Don't ask me questions
you don't want to know the answer to.

541
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:07,156
I saved your life.

542
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,993
I deserve to know
what you're planning...

543
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:13,342
Whatever it takes
to protect my country.{\pub}

544
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,465
You broke into his apartment?

545
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,035
I didn't break in.

546
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:29,301
{\pos(192,210)}I wish I believed you.

547
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:30,936
{\pos(192,210)}I can fix this.

548
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:32,556
{\pos(192,210)}I already did.

549
00:31:34,045 --> 00:31:36,095
{\pos(192,210)}He was going to press charges.

550
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:38,854
{\pos(192,210)}but... I promised him you'd leave.

551
00:31:41,563 --> 00:31:42,775
You're kicking me out?

552
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,549
I'll explain it
to your psychiatrist, but...

553
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:49,645
You got to go somewhere else.

554
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:55,519
I know when things go wrong,
usually you just double down

555
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:59,096
and get more involved,
but here you could go to jail.

556
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,185
And I truly believe

557
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,214
that you've changed enough
to know this is the right thing.

558
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:13,639
We need a blood sample.

559
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,285
We got to do the anticentromere
antibody test.

560
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,894
It'll show House is right.
It's scleroderma.

561
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:20,855
Why are you doing this now?

562
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:23,888
Because I didn't want to kill him

563
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,877
and you're right.

564
00:32:26,523 --> 00:32:28,043
I have to take a side.

565
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:30,881
So I'm going to do what I can
to keep him alive.

566
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:34,160
I'll get you the blood.

567
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:39,144
Positive
for anticentromere antibodies.

568
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:42,260
Better get him off the anti-fungals
and onto steroids immediately.

569
00:32:42,385 --> 00:32:45,195
I told you before,
this only points to scleroderma.

570
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,798
- It doesn't prove it.
- You're just gonna ignore the test?

571
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,711
Blasto still fits best.

572
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:52,261
{\I know }It's not conclusive,
but when you put it with the other...

573
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,079
I've made my decision.

574
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,481
Have you told Thirteen
you were wrong to fire her?

575
00:33:04,324 --> 00:33:06,369
What does that have to do
with anything?

576
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,627
I've worked with you
long enough to know you're reasonable.

577
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:11,791
You can usually admit
when you're wrong.

578
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:14,908
But there's some deep part of you,

579
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:18,547
that when you find you're wrong
about the{\ most important} decisions you've made,

580
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:21,521
you get insecure
and you just retrench.

581
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,402
If you want to mess up
your relationship, {\that's your right}OK,

582
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:26,587
but you mess this up,
our patient dies.

583
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:34,345
Switch him to steroids.

584
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:45,945
Hi, honey.

585
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,570
How was your day?

586
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:56,659
Morning.

587
00:33:58,526 --> 00:33:59,676
First of all,

588
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:01,301
my bad.

589
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:04,530
I've gone through
this whole thing recently.

590
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,549
I don't want to bore you.
Short version:

591
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:10,155
I'm really trying
to work on some stuff.

592
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,918
This is a definite setback.

593
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:14,977
Although,

594
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,956
in fairness,
you really did make it tough.

595
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,851
Phantom pain in your missing arm?

596
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:26,647
Five different kinds of painkiller
in your medicine cabinet.

597
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:28,399
That's what this

598
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,986
magic box
of neurological trickery is for.

599
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:37,366
This would be a lot easier if you do
what the crazy guy who tied you up says.

600
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,229
Put your hand in there.
Put your hand in there.

601
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:53,156
Now, look.
It's mirror magic.

602
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:55,968
Your arm is back.

603
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:59,609
Now clench both your fists
at the same time.

604
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,621
Clench.
Real hard.

605
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:10,418
If you believe in God,

606
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:13,777
pray that this is gonna work.

607
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,594
You might also want to ask him
why he blew off your arm.

608
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:20,838
Ready?

609
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:23,883
Now let go.

610
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,269
Oh, my God.

611
00:35:39,582 --> 00:35:40,732
It relaxed.

612
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:43,237
For 36 years, I've been in pain.

613
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:45,201
And it's finally gone.

614
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,621
Oh, my God.

615
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:56,457
Thank you.

616
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,495
O2 sat's down to 88.

617
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,702
Going through the main stem bronchus
into the right upper lobe.

618
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,621
Get them out of here.

619
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,414
- It's OK.
- Bleeder.

620
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:09,378
Cauterizing.

621
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,528
- Got it?
- Yeah.

622
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,385
Get the paddles!

623
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,971
- I'm going back in.
- What is happening?

624
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,515
- He's bleeding into his lungs.
- Another bleeder.

625
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,183
- I can get it.
- Hold on.

626
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,251
There's a third.

627
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:31,313
God, there's a dozen.

628
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:33,961
Shock him.

629
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:35,138
Clear.

630
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:40,031
Charging. Clear.{\pub}

631
00:37:29,596 --> 00:37:31,296
You want to curl up and cry,

632
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:33,793
Lounge chair's a little more comfy.

633
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,140
I switched is meds.

634
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:39,880
I thought I was wrong
so I took him of the anti-fungals.

635
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:42,566
Put him on steroids like you said.

636
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:44,178
You know what that means.

637
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:46,321
I was too late.

638
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,600
Or I was right in the first place.

639
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,371
So either you killed him

640
00:37:55,515 --> 00:37:58,115
by not having confidence
in your opinion,

641
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:02,687
Or you killed him by being
too attached to your opinion.

642
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:05,791
If you're anything like me...
and, by the way, you are...

643
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:08,008
you need to know which.

644
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,938
He's under lock and key
in the morgue.

645
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:14,531
His government wants
their own doctors to do the autopsy.

646
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,652
They're taking his body out
tomorrow.

647
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:19,565
There's a reason I hired you.

648
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,468
You used to know
what to do with a locked door.

649
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:36,063
I went down to the morgue
to rerun the antibodies test.

650
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:39,995
- We ran it twice.
- Turns out I couldn't get in.

651
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:42,236
They had an armed guard.

652
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:44,101
But I saw this.

653
00:38:48,502 --> 00:38:50,814
It's a sign-in sheet
from the morgue.

654
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,830
Your signature.

655
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:55,193
9:45 this morning.

656
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:57,585
That's right
before you guys ran the test.

657
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,338
What were you doing there?

658
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:04,258
- Follow-up on a clinic case.
- What case?

659
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,103
- You think this is really important...
- One of the patients in the morgue

660
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:10,014
was a 70-year-old woman
who had scleroderma.

661
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:14,515
You and Cameron,
if you took that woman's blood,

662
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,525
you could have messed up
the test results

663
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,945
so we treated Dibala
for the wrong disease.

664
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:23,528
She had nothing to do with it.

665
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:26,405
You son of a bitch.

666
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,724
He was going to kill the Sitibi.

667
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:33,149
- Every last one of them.
- I don't care what he was gonna do.

668
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:36,373
He came to us and put his life
in our hands.

669
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:38,576
All the good we've done...

670
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:41,654
every life we've saved...

671
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,144
it would have meant nothing

672
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:47,802
if we just sent him off
to kill hundreds of thousands of people.

673
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,480
Look at the news.

674
00:39:50,374 --> 00:39:52,014
The moderates are taking over.

675
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:54,296
There's hope for peace talks.

676
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,354
You tell the world
that I faked this test,

677
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:00,998
Dibala becomes a martyr.

678
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:02,983
The massacres begin.

679
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:05,277
I cover this up,

680
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:06,987
I become your accomplice.

681
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,115
You think you can guilt me
into that?

682
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:18,379
If the cops are gonna come for me,

683
00:40:19,113 --> 00:40:20,463
please warn me...

684
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:23,917
so that I can tell my wife first.

685
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:38,059
You really think
you can kill another human being

686
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:40,111
without any consequences
to yourself?

687
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,404
My neighbor called.

688
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,107
He sounded...

689
00:41:00,026 --> 00:41:00,875
happy.

690
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,770
That's nice.

691
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:07,511
Even nicer,
he's approving the garden expansion.

692
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:11,651
And even more nicer,

693
00:41:12,143 --> 00:41:14,168
he's not going to press charges.

694
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:16,557
Even if you don't move out.

695
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:19,458
What did you do to him?

696
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:21,738
I was nice.

697
00:41:25,226 --> 00:41:26,976
You really want to know?

698
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
I think...

699
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:33,032
I want to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

700
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,277
<i>Alligator's main prey
is smaller animals</i>

701
00:41:39,402 --> 00:41:41,584
<i>that they can kill and eat
with a single bite.</i>
