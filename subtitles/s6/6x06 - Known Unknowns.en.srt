She's my "plus one."

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,941
Yes.

We had a few drinks

28
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,521

30
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:37,058
I think I hate you

Colt took me up to the roof,

32
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:40,962
But by then the gate
to the pool was locked.

33
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,330
So no one was up there.

34
00:01:42,398 --> 00:01:48,103
So we just climbed over
and jumped down and, um...

35
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,040
Went skinny dipping.

36
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:54,142
Did you do it?
No.

<i>He was so sweet.</i>

38
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:59,147
Later, he played his guitar,
and he wrote a song for me.

00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:00,648

Jord, what happened
to your foot?

42
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:09,390
<i>(Avery)
Maybe you twisted your ankle
when you jumped.</i>

43
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,392
<i>(Kaitlin)
Or it could be
your allergies.</i>

44
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,261
My aunt was allergic
to some cold medication,

45
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:17,165
<i>and her hands swelled up

46

Why are you packing?

53
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:09,050
We're leaving this afternoon

00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:10,585

55
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:12,153
<i>We?

Think of it as a vacation.

<i>I'd be here for you.

<i>So it's not a discussion.

71
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:43,585

73

I've got no idea
what's wrong with her.

75
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,691
So odds are, not fatal.

We have to leave in an hour,
so should we eenie-meenie?

86
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:17,418
The fall would explain
the lower leg damage,

87
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:18,987
but not the swollen hands.

88
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:21,022
Hard landing caused
crushed muscles.

89
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,557
<i>crushed muscles released toxins
into the blood stream.</i>

90
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,526
Toxins caused swelling
in the hands and legs.

91
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:27,595
Just another way of saying
It's rhabdo.

They're working on a project

95
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:35,837
Could you be sitting
any further away from Chase

96
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:36,738
<i>and still be
in the same room?</i>

97
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:38,539
It doesn't have to be rhabdo.

98
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:40,275
The swelling could also be
caused by deep vein thrombosis.

99
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:41,476
She has allergies.

100
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:42,777
<i>could be anaphylaxis</i>

101
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:44,145
<i>or some heart condition
that we don't--</i>

102
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:45,346
It can't really be
any of those things

103
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:48,082
Since it's rhabdo.

104
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,851
I know it's rhabdo.
Foreman knows it's rhabdo.

105
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,121
Deep in his heart,
even Chase knows it's rhabdo.

106
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,455
Isn't it annoying when
everybody in the room knows

107
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:56,457
<i>something you don't?</i>

108
00:04:56,525 --> 00:05:01,162

114
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:16,744
By the way, I killed someone.

115
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,546
If I tell her,

116
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:20,848
that's dumping a burden
on her forever.

117
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:24,752
Okay.

120
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:41,836
Tell me what you came here
for, House.

121
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:43,237
I've got a legitimate
medical reason.

122
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,872
You must be so proud.

123
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,142
I've forgotten it.

124
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,877
I guess it's no big deal,

125
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:51,646
since I was only using it
as an excuse

126
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:53,014

127
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:56,718
I feel bad.

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,932
I need you to authorize the

00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:14,168
That's why I'm holding this

There's a lot to be done

I love that you checked.

147
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,699
But Wilson said--

148
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:45,900
That I have a case?
yeah.

149
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:48,469
You're authorizing
the discharge right now.

150
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:52,206
<i>That was a metaphor.</i>

151
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,218
Busy right now.

152
00:07:04,286 --> 00:07:06,921
Is he dying?
Yeah.

153
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:09,257
In the next ten minutes?

154
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,993
Unfortunately, no.

155
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,196
He's in a lot of pain.

156
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:16,798
I've thought about it.
you're right.

157
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:18,232
I should go
to the conference.

158
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,934
You found out
Cuddy's going.

159
00:07:20,002 --> 00:07:23,171
Oh, God, no.

160
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:25,006
She'll ruin everything.

161
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:26,841
We leave in two hours.

162
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:35,349

Two days away.

166
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,267
You think I should pack ball-y?

167
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:54,301
<i>You can't leave.</i>

168
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,537
You lit a fuse.

169
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:57,738
You need to watch
the bomb go off.

170
00:07:57,806 --> 00:07:59,707
The bomb was gonna
go off on its own

171
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:01,809
if you kept quiet.

172
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:03,778
So now you either have to
come up with a convincing lie,

173
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:05,579
<i>or tell her the truth.</i>

174
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:08,149
Your choice.

Of course.

00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,055
of muscle crush.

178
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:29,804
Hi.

179
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,839
I'm your doctor.

180
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:34,141
This is Lars Ulrich,

181
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,043
<i>[Metallica's Fuel playing]
the greatest metal drummer
of all-time.</i>

182
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:37,044
You know the song?

183
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:38,979
<i>Good.</i>

184
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:42,583
Drumstick.
Another drumstick.

185
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:43,784
I want you to rock out
to the music

186
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:46,887
the way you did last night.

187
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:48,789
<i>Go on.</i>

188
00:08:48,857 --> 00:08:49,924
This is a classic
medical test.

189
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,759
<i>Hippocrates used it.</i>

190
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:55,129
Let's go.

191
00:08:58,266 --> 00:08:59,100
<i>Come on,
you've gotta keep time!</i>

192
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,435
Cross over on the high hat.

193
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:04,238
Let's head bang!

194
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,675
House, what are you doing?

195
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:10,077
The chart said
her potassium's low.

196
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:12,379
<i>Rhabdo elevates the potassium.</i>

197
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,515
And monkey drums.

198
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,550
<i>Ergo...</i>

199
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:18,185
<i>The levels must've been
really low</i>

200
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,787
last night.

201
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:23,824
<i>Which causes...</i>

202
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:26,427
I can't move them.

203
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:27,728
[music stops]

204
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:29,964
Temporary muscle paralysis.

205
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,366
<i>Given this rate
of muscle fatigue,</i>

206
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:33,801
there's no way
she could've climbed stairs

207
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,402
and then a fence to the pool.

208
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,139
Low potassium means
no jump,

209
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:39,373
means no trauma.

210
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,942
<i>tests mean "yes rhabdo."</i>

211
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,378
Ergo, something else caused
both the rhabdo

212
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:46,480
and the low potassium.

213
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:49,683
This time start by getting
an accurate history.

214
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,085
Be careful.

215
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:53,988
Our patient's a big fat liar.

216
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,975
What did you really do
last night?

217
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:58,527
<i>(Cameron)
We need to find the cause</i>

218
00:09:58,594 --> 00:09:59,861
<i>of your low potassium.</i>

219
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,129
You could have
a kidney disorder,

220
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:02,631
leukemia, adenoma.

221
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:04,666
We need to know about
any drugs or alcohol.

222
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:07,235
<i>anything that might have
threatened your health.</i>

223
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:10,772
Come on, Jord.

224
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,342
Okay, we didn't spend the night
with the band.

225
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,544
You can't tell
our friends.

226
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:17,512
<i>have you heard of
Stiletto:</i>

227
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,047
<i>Warrior Queen of Space?</i>

228
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:20,115
It's a comic book right?

229
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:21,583
Thank you.
yeah.

230
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:23,852
Yes, and a freaking amazing
new sci-fi series.

231
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,721
<i>and they're filming
the motion picture now.</i>

232
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:28,557
It's a prequel.

233
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:29,891
The other girls
wouldn't get it.

234
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,960
<i>only Phoebe understands
my passion.</i>

235
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:36,164
Only Phoebe understands
the bushido of the heel.

236
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:38,300
[girls chuckle]

237
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,435
So what actually happened
last night?

238
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,571
(Jordan)
We were with our friends
trying to get into

239
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:44,306
the Pharmacide tour party
at the Adams.

240
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:48,777
And then I found out that
Jeffrey Keener's gonna be there.

241
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:52,848
I follow his tweets.

242
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:54,750
It's tragic that I have
to explain this.

243
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:06,261
<i>he's the creator of Stiletto
issue number one.</i>

244
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:07,963
And the tv show.

245
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,499
He's a God.

246
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:12,534
So did you guys
go up to him?

247
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:13,902
God, no.

248
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,403
We keep a ten-foot rule.

249
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,606
It's not stalking
if you don't go up

250
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:18,707
to the person
and bother them.

251
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:20,876
So we just
followed him around.

252
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:22,544
Discreetly.

253
00:11:22,612 --> 00:11:23,712
He ditched
after half an hour

254
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
and went down
to the hotel restaurant

255
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:25,947
for a late dinner.

256
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,682
And you went with him?
Discreetly.

257
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:34,656
(Jordan)
We played it so cool.

258
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:37,025
(Phoebe)
For two hours,
we lived his life.

259
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:39,161
<i>We did everything he did.</i>

260
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:41,229
Ate the exact same meal
he ate.

261
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:43,698
Cool.

262
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:45,534
The rest of their story
checks out.

263
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,435
The hotel manager says
mom and dad were charged

264
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:48,870
for food and a room,

265
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:51,173
<i>three pay-per-view episodes
of Stiletto.</i>

266
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,874
Are you trying
to kill yourself?

267
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:54,810
It's from the same batch
the girls ate.

268
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:56,244
They ate what he ate.

269
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:58,013
And what a hundred
other healthy people ate.

270
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,849
Dig in.
Lunch is on the Adams.

271
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:03,185
What if food is
the answer?

272
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:05,153
Not this food. Any food.

273
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:07,455
<i>Jordan says
she ate all of this.</i>

274
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:08,857
She's 16,
all about body image,

275
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,125
and she obviously worries
about fitting in.

276
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:12,594
Bulimia would account
for her symptoms.

277
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,429
<i>we should do a barium swallow
for mallory weiss tears,</i>

278
00:12:14,497 --> 00:12:15,864
Start her on
nutritional supplements,

279
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:18,166
get a psych consult.

280
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:22,504
Why are you reading
my program guide?

281
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:23,538
It's not like you plan on
attending

282
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:24,873
any of the presentations.

283
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:29,511
I like to know
how much boredom I'm missing.

284
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,913
"Patient perceptions
of complications

285

286
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,351
<i>You didn't tell me
you were giving a paper.</i>

287
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:38,086
And that was wrong?

288
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:39,487
Last time you presented
a paper,

289
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:41,089
you gave me an advance copy
and asked for feedback.

290
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:43,091
And you're wondering why

291
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,826
I wouldn't want to repeat
that experience?

292
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:47,929
Oh, look!
an '80s party.

293
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,764
<i>Just when you think</i>

294
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:51,099
you left Flock of Seagulls
behind

295
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,500
in your rearview mirror,

296
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:54,202
suddenly it's up ahead
like an undead hitchhiker.

297
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,237
Cuddy's going.

298
00:12:58,374 --> 00:13:00,175
Did you pack my leg warmers?

299
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:03,778
If you want her...
ask her out.

300
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:05,814
My God, man!

301
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:08,316
She's not some floozy
in a bar.

302
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:11,152
She's the floozy
I work for.

303
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,387
There's gotta be
no radical steps here.

304
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:13,488
Gotta be subtle.

305
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,223
We happened to attend
the same party.

306
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,525
The chat happens
to turn personal.

307
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:19,828
Like the frog
in gradually boiling water.

308
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,263
Exactly.

309
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,798
She'll be red and delicious
before she knows it.

310
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:25,600

What?

311
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:29,337
What could possibly go wrong?

312
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,243
Chase went to the gym
five times this week.
Okay.

313
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,578
<i>(Cameron) One of those times
I followed him.</i>

314
00:13:36,646 --> 00:13:38,113
What?

315
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,048
I followed him.

316
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:42,217
And yes, I know how humiliating
that admission is.

317
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:44,886
Where'd he go?

318
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,521
The gym, that time.

319
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:47,822
But I know that something's--

320
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,124
<i>I'm stopping you
right there.</i>

321
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:50,358
This is a conversation
you should be having

322
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:51,826
with Chase, not me.

323
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:53,929
I've tried having
this conversation with Chase.

324
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:56,564
No sign of tears.
It's not bulimia.

325
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:57,766
Is he having an affair?

326
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,568
No.

327
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:02,704
Why should I believe you?

328
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:04,272
You shouldn't.
you should believe him.

She's bleeding around her heart.

Blood constricted

00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,442
She's on antiarrhythmics,

342
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,344
but we don't know how long
we can keep her stable.

<i>(Foreman) seemed to be
triggered by stress.</i>

344

<i>Her parents had just--</i>

345
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,783
Did her blood pressure drop

Dropped to 50 systolic

Rules out chronic conditions.

348
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,256
Acute conditions limit us
to toxins, infections.

349
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,524
Could be anything.

350
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,259
A gas leak,
arsenic in the wallpaper,

fungus in the shower.

<i>You won't be hirable
anywhere.</i>

529
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:19,257
If there's one thing
I've learned from you,

530
00:23:19,324 --> 00:23:21,259
it's that I should do
what I think is right

531
00:23:21,326 --> 00:23:24,061
and not worry
about the consequences.

532
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,233
Yeah, it's worked out great
for me.

533
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,646
Um, I don't mean
to be rude,

534
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:42,547
but I'm expecting
a notes call from L.A.

535
00:23:42,614 --> 00:23:43,748
can we make this quick?

536
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:45,683
Did Jordan come to your room
the other night?

537
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:47,051
Let me put it another way.

538
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,519
We know Jordan came
to your room the other night.

539
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:52,089
Look, I've tried
to be helpful.

540
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:53,624
<i>i don't know why
you want to pretend</i>

541
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:54,826
<i>I'm lying to you.</i>

542
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,194
But this is getting
too weird for me.

543
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:57,228
We need to search your room.

544
00:23:57,296 --> 00:23:58,262
You don't,

545
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,764
because she was
never here.

546
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:02,366
Allison, calm down.

547
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:05,503
You would cover your ass at
the expense of someone's life?

548
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:07,438
We know she brought up
your journal.

549
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:15,913
That was helpful.

550
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:18,282
He'd be crazy
to risk his marriage

551
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,717
for a one-night stand
with a teenager.

552
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:20,985
Sensible people only
risk their marriage

553
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:22,186
for something
more serious?

554
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,455
I'm not having an affair.

555
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:27,124
We're talking about Keener.
Fine.

556
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:28,693
He doesn't care
about his marriage.

557
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,827
What about his career?

558
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:31,262
Statutory rape would
ruin it.

559
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,598
It's admitting statutory rape
that could ruin it.

560
00:24:33,665 --> 00:24:35,900
Which is why we'll never
hear the truth out of him.

561
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:38,035
Rufies OD explains
all her symptoms.

562
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,770
We should start treating her
with flumazenil.

563
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,575
Isn't the MRSA panel
going on?

564
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:46,878
We got kicked out.
She started crying.

565
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:49,914
Yeah, well, discussions
of urinary catheterization

566
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:51,549
<i>will do that to me too.</i>

567
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:53,050
The babysitter had
an emergency.

568
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:58,372
Oh...how did you like
'80s night?

569
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,274
House talked with you?

570
00:25:00,342 --> 00:25:03,744
I was being subtle
about it.

571
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:05,279
You left suddenly.

572
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:07,748
I know House can be

573
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:10,851
<i>a little much sometimes...
no, he was sweet.</i>

574
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,186
I just know better
than to rely on that.

575
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:14,789
He's trying.

576
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:16,090
<i>Yeah.</i>

577
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:18,359
I know.

578
00:25:18,427 --> 00:25:20,194
I'm a mother now.

579
00:25:20,262 --> 00:25:23,497
<i>I need a guy I can count on
every single day.</i>

580
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,133
That's never been House.

581
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:33,878
(Foreman) It's not rufies.

582
00:25:33,946 --> 00:25:35,713
She's bleeding
behind her kidneys.

583
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:37,915
We're transfusing another
two units packed red cells,

584
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,150
But she keeps
springing leaks.

585
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:41,052
It looks like a toxic reaction.

586
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,987
<i>Keener must have
given her something.</i>

587
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:44,789
The guy's a comic book writer,

588
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:46,123
<i>not a drug dealer.</i>

589
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:47,224
There's a lot that wouldn't
show up

590
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:48,526
in a standard tox screen.

591
00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:49,760
But he's never gonna
tell us the truth.

592
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:54,198
Not gonna get the truth
out of her either.

593
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:59,603
We will if we drug her.

594
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,639
Amobarbital would suppress
her thalamus.

595
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:03,774
<i>(Chase) She's on antiarrhythmics.</i>

596
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,309
Amobarbital could stop
her heart.

597
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:06,744
She's already dying.

598
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:10,448
You're angry at me.

599
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,616
<i>You're taking it out
on this guy 'cause you think</i>

600
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:14,118
He's lying to you too.

601
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:16,287
And you're gonna kill
our patient in the process.

602
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:19,423
We need to know the truth.

603
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:20,424
We should call House.

604
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:21,792
Yeah.

605
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,928
He'll recommend we take
the cautious approach.

606
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:26,230
[whistling]
[door shuts]

607
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,403
Pretzel?

608
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:33,904
Those are gonna show up
on my credit card

609
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,439
at seven bucks a bag.

610
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:37,908
<i>There's an all-you-can-eat
buffet downstairs.</i>

611
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:40,544
Studies show that $10 wine
tastes better

612
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:43,247
if you're told that
it costs $90.

613
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:46,117
I'm sure the same thing
must be true of grape soda.

614
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:47,685
Have one.

615
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:52,923
We can toast your
pending unemployment.

616
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:03,000
Yes, you can sit here
running up my hotel bill,

617
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,636
or you can go get the woman
of your dreams.

618
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:08,839
I didn't know Angela Merkel
was attending the conference.

619
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:10,841
I just spoke with Cuddy.

620
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:12,376
<i>She doesn't think
you're reliable.</i>

621
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:14,812
<i>And you will remain
friend-zoned</i>

622
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,414
until that changes.

623
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:17,915
<i>I can't convince her</i>

624
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:21,118
That I've changed my entire
personality in a weekend.

625
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:22,987
Yeah, but you could make
the first step.

626
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:24,388
What does she need?

627
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:25,923
Today, a babysitter.

628
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:31,729
What are you thinking about?

629
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:34,598
<i>Fjords.
You see?</i>

630
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:35,900
Seriously.

631
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:38,102
<i>I know this is out
of your comfort zone,</i>

632
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,503
But don't scheme.

633
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:40,838
<i>Don't--</i>

634
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:42,206
Just do the deed--

635
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:43,841
You tell me that
I've gotta show her

636
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,176
I've changed,

637
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:46,544
and yet you act like
you don't believe I can.

638
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:49,747
<i>If I can't convince
my best friend...</i>

639
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:52,116
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--

640
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:54,452
<i>I didn't mean...</i>

641
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:57,188
I didn't mean...

642
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,727
You drugged me.

643
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:09,066
She's better off
without you.

644
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:16,907
Words can hurt, you know.

645
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:21,612
I thought truth serum was
only stuff they gave people

646
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,080
in lame spy movies.

647
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:24,181
<i>(Cameron)
We know you're scared.</i>

648
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,317
But we know you want
to tell the truth.

649
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:28,285
We're gonna help you
do that.

650
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,387
<i>(Cameron) What happened between you
and Jeffrey Keener</i>

651
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:31,722
<i>the night you went up
to his room?</i>

652
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:40,598
(Jordan) I couldn't believe
he even talked to me.

653
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:42,933
I told him how much
his work means to me.

654
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:49,073
I figured I must sound
like a moron.

655
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:52,042
But he was nice about it.

656
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,880
He said I was special.

657
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:57,448
Heart rate's increasing.

658
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:59,717
140's acceptable.
Let her talk.

659
00:28:59,784 --> 00:29:02,720
Did he give you anything?
a drink, pills?

660
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:04,655
(Jordan) He said it was ecstasy.

661
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:07,525
But it didn't look like ecstasy,

662
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:08,559
and it didn't really
make me feel

663
00:29:08,627 --> 00:29:11,695
how ecstasy usually does.

664
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,063
<i>(Cameron)
How did it make you feel?</i>

665
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,798
It just made me
really tired.

666
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:17,501
What did it look like?
a capsule? Tablet?

667
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,237
It was a tablet. Round.

668
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:21,672
Could be lithium.

669
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,408
(Jordan) He just started touching me.

670
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:27,077
At first it seemed nice.

671
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:28,879
But then...

672
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:31,849
I didn't want to insult him.

673
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:34,151
That's enough.

674
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:39,190
I'm so sorry.

675
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:43,060
I love you guys so much,
and I just--

676
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:45,429
I feel like I've let you down.

677
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:47,731
I'm gonna kill him.

678
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:48,866
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch.

679
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:52,970
Before you do that,
look here.

680
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:55,539
<i>(Foreman) Increased periorbital
blood flow throughout.</i>

681
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:59,777
It means everything she's
been saying has been a lie.

682
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:02,746
Everything?

683
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:05,816
S-so you still don't know
what's wrong with her?

684
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:08,018
Sorry.

685
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,159
Oh, I thought you were
room service.

686
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:18,028
Something going on
with your patient?

687
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:19,396
It's quiet in there.

688
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:21,365
Is Rachel asleep?

689
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:24,768
I thought maybe you could use
a babysitter.

690
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:30,608
Actually, I've got her
in day care downstairs.

691
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:32,676
Oh.

692
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:35,045
Great.

693
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:36,947
Maybe later.

694
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:38,616
[Rachel laughs]

695
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:43,120
[Rachel cooing]

696
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,067
Hey, House.

697
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:59,169
Hey, Lucas.

698
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:01,438
This is awkward.

699
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:03,574
A bit.

700
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:09,680
That awkwardness would
probably go away if I left.

701
00:31:26,423 --> 00:31:27,457
Huh?

702
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:27,959
It's Foreman.

703
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:29,726
I'm trying to update House,

He's not here.

706
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,168
Patient's losing blood faster
than we can transfuse.

707
00:31:38,236 --> 00:31:39,803
Cameron did an online search
and found out

00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:45,542
Oh, no!

711
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,845
I was supposed to be giving
a paper five minutes ago.

712
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:53,817
Okay...okay...

713
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:56,453
Dr. Wilson has asked me
to tender his apologies

714
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:57,954
for his absence.

715
00:31:58,022 --> 00:32:00,324

762

looking at rickettsia.

00:34:42,353 --> 00:34:44,955
Thanks for the message.

Continue.
What the hell?

765
00:34:46,624 --> 00:34:47,924
You think that little
shout-out is gonna

766
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:49,459
make me forget that
you drugged me,

767
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:51,495
hid my pants,
stole my speech?

768
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:54,364
You wanted the paper
out there, it's out there.

769
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:55,832
And your job is safe.

770
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,267
That was my paper.

771
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:59,736
You don't ask what I want,
you ignore my wishes,

00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:02,072
I'm waiting for you to name

775
00:35:03,374 --> 00:35:05,942
You've got no good reason
to be angry with me.

776
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,278
Oh, really?
I should be thanking you?

777
00:35:08,346 --> 00:35:11,248
If this was about getting
the story out there, then yeah.

778
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:13,416
Of course, if this is actually
about something else...

779
00:35:13,484 --> 00:35:16,353
Maybe you feeling impotent
because patients keep dying

780
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,388
and you think you need to make
some grand, stupid gesture--

781
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:20,423
You need to be a hero--

782
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:23,159
Well, then, yeah, sorry.
I did screw it up.

783
00:35:23,227 --> 00:35:26,162
You stepped
over the line.

784
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,664
This was not
your decision.

785
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:31,268
My God, there are 10,000
oncologists in this country.

786
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:33,069
Every one of them
loses patients.

787
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:35,572
But only you would feel
guilty enough...

788
00:35:40,278 --> 00:35:42,312
Of course,

789
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,647
we can't even argue
on my schedule.

790
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:48,418

00:35:57,562 --> 00:35:58,728
<i>It's not the meds.</i>

794
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:00,730
It's the blood

795
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:04,034
<i>What's everybody doing?
you're stunned, right?</i>

796
00:36:04,101 --> 00:36:05,502
<i>I mean, blood?</i>

797
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,770
<i>(mother) She's had internal bleeding.</i>

798
00:36:06,837 --> 00:36:08,338
She needs the blood to--

799
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:09,739
<i>(House)
Is that the mom?</i>

800
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:12,108
<i>I've got a good comeback
if it's the mom.</i>

801
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:14,344
Yes, I'm her mother.

802
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:17,280
Sure, she needs blood,
if you want to kill her.

803
00:36:17,348 --> 00:36:20,183
<i>Then you'd have nobody left
to neglect--great plan.</i>

804

806
00:36:25,756 --> 00:36:28,224

<i>(House) Thus proving that she did.

808
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:31,928

those oysters.

809
00:36:31,996 --> 00:36:34,197
<i>I ate--
Is that the dad?</i>

810
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:36,666
I've got a good comeback--
It's Chase.

811
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:38,868
Oh, I thought the dad might've
been Australian too.

812
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:40,804
<i>There was nothing wrong
with the oysters.</i>

813
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:42,939
All oysters have vibrio.

814
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:46,042
But almost no one has
hemochromatosis.

815
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,812

817
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:52,048
<i>but it got attributed
to bulimia,</i>

818
00:36:52,116 --> 00:36:54,718
so she got supplements.
With iron.

819
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:57,487
<i>(House) Which overcooked the liver,
which caused bleeding.</i>

820
00:36:57,555 --> 00:37:00,490
More blood, more iron,
more bleeding, more blood.

821
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:02,125
Is she going to be okay?

822
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:04,494
Only if we give her
high-dose ceftazidime

<i>for the vibrio and chelate
for the hemochromatosis.</i>

<i>Now, Cameron,</i>

825
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:09,899
Pick up the phone
and give me a dramatic exit.

826
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:27,484
So...how'd you two
crazy kids hook up?

827
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:29,919
I suspected someone in
accounting was skimming money,

828
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:31,888
<i>and I wanted to
investigate quietly.</i>

829
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:36,059
And since you introduced me
to the only detective I know...

830
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:37,694
And one thing leads
to another.

831
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,202
Why keep it a secret?

832
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,139
<i>You protecting me

Yeah. She was worried.

840
00:38:02,386 --> 00:38:04,521
A little worried.

841
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:06,356
As a friend.

842
00:38:06,424 --> 00:38:08,258
<i>I had to hide

00:38:09,493 --> 00:38:11,828
Kinda sucked.

00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:13,463
I told her
it wasn't necessary.

846

I don't think we need
to talk--

849
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:21,705
I mean, I imagine having sex
with women all the time.

850
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:23,139
No big deal.

851
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:26,042
<i>Though I guess if they knew
what I imagine,</i>

852
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,111
it could get awkward.

853
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:30,246
<i>And I guess
it's different because</i>

854
00:38:30,314 --> 00:38:32,782
in the fantasy,
she was your savior.

855
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,018
<i>But I mean,
that was months ago, right?</i>

856
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:37,654
All the work that you had to do
to get straight--

857
00:38:37,722 --> 00:38:39,289
You've been institutionalized.

858
00:38:39,356 --> 00:38:41,091
You've had way bigger stuff
to deal with.

859
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,026
I should shut up.

Can I buy you a ginger ale?

862
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:53,136
A ginger ale would be good.

00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,100
Can you at least
come talk to 'em?

877
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:25,068
Let me see.

878
00:39:30,474 --> 00:39:32,575
You okay?
Yeah.

879
00:39:32,643 --> 00:39:35,078
No.

880
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:37,280
<i>(mother) Soil engineering report
was fine.</i>

881
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:38,782
I'm used to it.

882
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,049
<i>(mother) Who are you talking to?</i>

883
00:39:40,117 --> 00:39:42,051
So...about what happened
that night.

884
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:49,425
(Jordan)
I never even got up
the courage

885
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:53,496
To knock on his door.

886
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,305
<i>(mother) Well, you'll have to send me
their numbers.</i>

887
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:07,210
(Cuddy) Yea!

888
00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:09,078
[laughing]

889
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:11,748
[baby giggling]

890
00:40:11,816 --> 00:40:13,183
(Cuddy) What is that?

891
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,221
(Lucas) Are you driving?

892
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:21,191
He looks like a guy
who'd be there every day.

893
00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:24,093
Minibar is restocked.

894
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:26,462
I say we grab some pretzels
for the road--

895
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,864
When you do what I did,

896
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:29,999
it's not enough
to tell yourself

897
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:32,302
you did nothing wrong.

898
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,437
You need to hear it
from someone else.

899
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:39,943
If not God or society,
a friend.

900
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,911
Otherwise you go crazy.

901
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:46,049
What you said to me
up there...

902
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:48,751
Thank you.

903
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:50,887
You're a good friend.

904
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:53,289
Cuddy should know that.

905
00:40:53,357 --> 00:40:56,426
Yeah, you should let her know
that I drugged you

906
00:40:56,493 --> 00:40:57,694
So you wouldn't confess
to murder.

907
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:02,098
Let's get out of here.

908
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,434
(Wilson) Someone could have
recognized you.

909
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:07,537
First U.S. conference
I've attended in 15 years.

910
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:09,472
Perlmutter?

911
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,675
Toronto, all weekend.
Airtight alibi.

912
00:41:22,186 --> 00:41:25,421
I'm sorry.

913
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:30,026
I don't know why I always
suspect the worst.

914
00:41:30,094 --> 00:41:31,995
If you say you're not
having an affair,

915
00:41:32,062 --> 00:41:34,030
you're not having
an affair.

916
00:41:42,973 --> 00:41:44,440
Oh, God, you are.

917
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:46,709
I'm not.
Okay. Sorry.

918
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:49,012
Again.

919
00:41:54,585 --> 00:42:00,723
If you don't want
to tell...okay.

920
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:04,594
But I could help.

921
00:42:04,662 --> 00:42:08,531
Whatever this is,
it's eating away at you.

922
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:12,168
We could get past it together.

923
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:17,640
I love you
no matter what.

924
00:42:29,553 --> 00:42:34,691
We lose patients sometimes.

925
00:42:34,758 --> 00:42:39,295
One of those patients...

926
00:42:39,363 --> 00:42:42,231
Dibala...

927
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:43,766
We didn't ac--

928
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,367
We didn't actually
lose him.

929
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,868
I killed him.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
