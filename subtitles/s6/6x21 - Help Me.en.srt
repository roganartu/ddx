1
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:37,369
A crane collapsed
in downtown Trenton.

2
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:39,007
Don't care.

3
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,022
That's my great-grandfather.

4
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:47,865
No, it's just a book he wrote.

5
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:49,903
Open it up.

6
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,893
<i>Seriously, you're giving
this to us?</i>

7
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:57,530
<i>It's a big step you're taking.</i>

8
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,865
I wanted to congratulate you.

9
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:01,372
I understand that's
the adult thing to do.

10
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:02,645
How did you know?

11
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,017
I've known for a while.

12
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:06,459
The fact that you
decided to cohabitate

13
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,569
is not exactly a spoiler.

14
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,980
Unless my intel is wrong.

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,586
Trouble in paradise?

16
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:15,230
We have to get to Trenton.

17
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:35,479

19
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,588
Can you hear me?

20
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:51,825
Hmm?

21
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:54,034
That sound like a yes?

22
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,378
Sir, we have to get you to the O.R.

23
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,051
<i>You have a bad wound,
but we're gonna pack it</i>

24
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:59,959
and transport you
as fast as we can.

25
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:04,678
Skull fracture.
Glasgow coma score of 11.

26
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,786
She's immediate.

27
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,259
<i>Move on.</i>

28
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:10,166
This guy's dead.
His wounds aren't so--

29
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,606
forget the wound. Look at his toes.

30
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:15,688
Atherosclerotic emboli.
He'll never survive the surgery.

31
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,930
Maybe his shoes were too tight.

32
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,838
It's not the shoes.
Skin shows smoker's facies.

33
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:22,617
He's not gonna make
it till morning.

34
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:24,257
He'll just take up
an ambulance ride,

35
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:26,633
surgeon's time, and an icu bed.

36
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:30,147
He's expectant. Leave him.

37
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:33,324
I only nodded off for a second.

38
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:36,000
I lost control of the load.
I'm so sorry.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,875
Don't worry. We're gonna
get you outta here.

40
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,481
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:40,720
He's secure.

42
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,824
Ready? Three, two, one.

43
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:46,142
That's it.

44
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,388
Crane operator.
Made it through amazingly well.

45
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:52,500
Lucid and responsive.
Stable fracture, right humerus.

46
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,910
Haven't gotten to
his lower half yet.

47
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,918
Tell me when something hurts.

48
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:59,427
I fell asleep.
Killed all those people.

49
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:02,742
Something other than
your conscience.

50
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,382
Is that a pill in your pocket,

51
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:05,988
<i>or are you just happy to have</i>

52
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:09,401
a tiny pill-shaped penis?

53
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,974
Caffeine pills.

54
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,648
You fell asleep taking these?

55
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:14,757
I drank two cups of coffee too.

56
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:16,564
Is that normal for you?

57
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:18,471
No, I hate coffee.
I'm working on no sleep.

58
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:19,911
My daughter has the flu.

59
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,919
This much caffeine
for a coffee virgin.

60
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,999
There's no way he fell asleep.
He passed out.

61
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,174
<i>Which means a neurological
disorder</i>

62
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:28,782
caused the crash, not fatigue.

63
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:29,785
Hey.

64
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:34,439
We're taking the crane
operator back to Princeton.

65
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,381
They said he was barely hurt-
-he can wait.

66
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:37,787
Steal an ambulance.
And call the team.

67
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:39,127
Tell 'em we got a case.

68
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:42,207
House. No! I need you here.

69
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:45,052
And he needs me there.
And he moans louder than you do.

70
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,827
There were over 100
people in that building.

71
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,501
Only 76 have been accounted for.

72
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:52,818
Foreman and your team can handle
the crane operator for now.

73
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:14,609
Having fun down there?

74
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:15,847
<i>Lots!</i>

75
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:18,659
Every time Cuddy
leans over a patient,

76
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:22,107
it's another opportunity
for a down blouse nip slip.

77
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:24,553
What's going on
between her and Lucas?

78
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:25,825
Besides them moving in together?

79
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,164
That's not enough for you?

80
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:30,278
I gave her the
housewarming gift earlier.

81
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,789
And she paused for a split second,

82
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:34,865
like she was hiding something.

83
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:36,305
<i>It's probably her moral
revulsion</i>

84
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:37,678
at housewarming gifts.

85
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:39,688
Or maybe she didn't
want to accept a gift

86
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:41,362
for something she wasn't gonna do.

87
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:45,343
<i>You actually think they're not
moving in together?</i>

88
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,455
What was that? You okay?

89
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:51,235
Yep. Vending machine collapsed.

90
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:53,980
She still using your
ex-wife as a realtor?

91
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,553
<i>As far as I know.</i>

92
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:56,927
<i>Well, know a little farther,
will you?</i>

93
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:59,070
<i>Look into it.</i>

94
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:33,985
Hey!

95
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:36,161
There's somebody down here!

96
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:42,119
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

97
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,162
tap three times, or call out.

98
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:49,217
Is anyone there?

99
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm not getting anything.

100
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,544
I heard something-
-there's gotta be a void down there.

101
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:56,648
<i>There's a million voids down there.</i>

102
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:58,322
It was the parking garage.

103
00:06:58,322 --> 00:06:59,929
But equipment hasn't
picked up any movement.

104
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:01,369
Dogs haven't picked up any scent.

105
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,707
There's smashed cars down there.

106
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:04,583
The gasoline throw off their scent?

107
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,056
Look, we gotta get
back to work, okay?

108
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:09,805
We'll get to this area soon.
Excuse me.

109
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,496
Anybody hear me?

110
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,643
Hey!

111
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:14,924
Anybody hear me?

112
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:10,669
Aah! Oh...

113
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:17,534
Help me.

114
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:27,620
What's your name?

115
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,755
Please...my husband's gift.

116
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:38,533
I was supposed to pick
it up at the framers.

117
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,308
It's on Elm.

118
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:41,847
Well, you should
have told me earlier.

119
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,287
I could have picked
it up on the way.

120
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,798
What's your name?

121
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,070
It's a picture from
our Tortola trip.

122
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,543
For his birthday.

123
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,987
I'm not asking your name
because I wanna become friends.

124
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:54,435
I'm trying to gauge
your mental state.

125
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:56,108
Hanna.

126
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:59,222
Okay, that's a start.
What day of the week is it?

127
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:00,427
Tuesday.

128
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,637
Better still.

129
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:04,276
What happened?

130
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:07,994
You know that giant
construction crane next door?

131
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:11,141
It's kind of on top
of you right now.

132
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:14,822
Okay, I'm gonna try
to pull you out.

133
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,396
Ow! My leg!

134
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:18,438
Oh! Oh! Oh!

135
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,527
Okay, okay.

136
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:25,469
Whew...

137
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:27,344
I'm gonna need to get help.

138
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:29,118
No, stay! Someone else will come.

139
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:31,695
No one knows I'm down here.

140
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,838
Please! Stay with me.

141
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:36,282
Don't leave me in the dark.

142
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:38,124
I'll be right back.

143
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:39,897
No! Don't leave me in the dark!

144
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:42,475
Please stay!

145
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,830
He's still in the E.R., House.

146
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,539
We haven't had time to
start a differential.

147
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:51,179
Perfect! Let's start right now.

148
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,585
Put me on speaker.

149
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:56,702
What causes syncope?

150
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:58,779
Your guy's stable.
The two dozen other patients--

151
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,050
<i>don't need to be diagnosed.</i>

152
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,891
They just need to be bandaged.

153
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:04,939
What causes syncope?

154
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:06,077
Vasovagal reaction...

155
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:08,257
Meningioma. Sick sinus syndrome.

156
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:10,168
<i>Or you're wrong, and he just fell asleep.</i>

157
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:11,408
How's he gonna sleep

158
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:13,584
with 50 cups of coffee
going through his veins?

159
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:14,722
Were you never a medical resident?

160
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:16,932
I hear ten, eleven, and twelve.

161
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:18,406
<i>Where's Thirteen? She's not here.</i>

162
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:20,313
And the answer to your
next question is no.

163
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,751
I don't know where she is.

164
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:23,658
Do you have the answer to
my question after that?

165
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:26,438
<i>Space-occupying lesion in his brain
is most likely.</i>

166
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:27,977
Mri will prove I'm right.

167
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:29,182
Or it'll just prove

168
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:30,655
he suffered head
trauma from the crash.

169
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:32,194
<i>Which we'd wanna find anyway.</i>

170
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:35,239
Two birds with one scan. Do it.

171
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,916
Having trouble finding
a vein for Hanna's iv.

172
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,390
She getting weaker?

173
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,163
Paler? No, no. She's stable.

174
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:42,537
That means her blood
loss in minimal.

175
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:43,977
Buys us some time.

176
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:45,417
Get the iv into her tibia.

177
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:48,563
It's almost hollow,
feeds into the venous system.

178
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,854
Which they obviously don't
teach you in emt school.

179
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,470
This side's still
leaning pretty bad.

180
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,775
Gotta shore up this beam.

181
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:10,726
Told ya I'd be back.

182
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:12,568
<i>...On my side.</i>

183
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:13,805
Heard you might be thirsty.

184
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:16,349
Ah...

185
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,592
I assume that bodes
well for the rescue?

186
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:20,300
Structural beam.
High compression concrete.

187
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,639
I can't break it up.

188
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,113
You can't get me outta here?

189
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,952
<i>Naw. Just means we gotta
move on</i>

190
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,425
to a different piece of equipment.

191
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:28,568
I got airbags comin' in
that'll lift 70 tons.

192
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:32,551
What's your name?

193
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,392
You testing my mental state?

194
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:36,099
<i>I'm gonna be stuck down here
for a while.</i>

195
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:38,443
I'd like somebody to talk to.

196
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:39,815
Look, the guy who
just left is the one

197
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:41,622
who's gonna be holding
your hand through all this.

198
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:42,995
You talk to him.

199
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,501
Little pinch.

200
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,342
Aah! Oh! Ow!

201
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,330
<i>Oh... Okay. Big pinch.</i>

202
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,607
I gotta call my husband.

203
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,248
Can I use your phone?

204
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:56,553
Uh, no bars down here.

205
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,101
<i>L'chaim.</i>

206
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,612
Where are you going? Don't worry.

207
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:05,592
Fire marshal bill
will be back soon.

208
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,972
<i>So I hope I didn't weird
you out</i>

209
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:18,444
giving you that gift.

210
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:19,715
Can we talk about this later?

211
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,557
<i>Of course.</i>

212
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:24,971
Is now later?

213
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,713
Maybe things aren't going
so well with Lucas.

214
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,019
If so, I'm sorry.

215
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,593
I didn't mean to
step into anything.

216
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:32,003
There's no problems.
We're doing just great.

217
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,375
Thank you.

218
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,882
So why the weirdness?

219
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,800
Can you help?

220
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,048
When I opened it,

221
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:46,329
I didn't think it was
a housewarming gift.

222
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,207
I thought it was an
engagement present.

223
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:57,073
It just happened last night.

224
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:01,457
No wonder you wanna
hide this from me...

225
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,365
Since I'm such a delicate flower.

226
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:05,373
I didn't know what to say.

227
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:07,047
And I've been slightly distracted.

228
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,352
That might make sense,

229
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:09,724
'cept you're not wearing the ring.

230
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,800
So...You are hiding it,

231
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,843
which begs the question--

232
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:16,285
House...It's in my office drawer

233
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:18,595
because I knew I was coming here.

234
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:20,235
It's not weird.

235
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,980
There's no mystery.

236
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,593
I'm just getting married.

237
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:28,836
'Scuse me.

238
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:32,184
How much longer?

239
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:33,388
Uh, less than a minute.

240
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:35,427
Are you in any pain?

241
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:38,374
Nothing now. Just a
little claustrophobic.

242
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,851
<i>Shouldn't you be taking care
of those other people,</i>

243
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:43,060
the ones that I hurt?

244
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:48,747
<i>Everything checks out okay.</i>

245
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,210
My nose is bleeding.

246
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,021
It's expected, given the
trauma you've sustained.

247
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:01,498
<i>That's not expected.</i>

248
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,474
The way things fell,
this support beam

249
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,081
is now holding up a
giant pile of rubble.

250
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,725
We can't lift it without
jeopardizing everyone down here.

251
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:19,974
So it's time to discuss amputation.

252
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:28,515
No.

253
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:29,954
Please listen to me.

254
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:32,466
We've been down here
almost two hours.

255
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,542
<i>By the time they clear away the rubble-
-</i>

256
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,956
we are not cutting off her leg.

257
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:38,629
You don't have to rush through this

258
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:41,307
to make his job easier.

259
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,281
You kidding me?

260
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:45,256
We leave the leg pinned,
we're risking crush syndrome.

261
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:47,665
<i>What's that?</i>

262
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:49,172
Your leg isn't getting
enough circulation.

263
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:51,147
The longer it's pinned
the more the muscle dies.

264
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:52,718
So what does that mean,
like a limp?

265
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,795
<i>Dying muscles release poisons.</i>

266
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:56,737
We free your leg,

267
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:58,277
<i>the poisons rush back into your system.</i>

268
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:01,124
It could stop your heart.
So could cheeseburgers.

269
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:03,670
Let's get your lazy friends
to start moving that pile.

270
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,479
She's got two more hours
before crush syndrome

271
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:07,087
could possibly set in.

272
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:08,827
<i>We're digging up there by hand.</i>

273
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,104
I can't guarantee I can
get 10 tons of debris

274
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,515
<i>pulled off in two hours.
Well, you need to try.</i>

275
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,024
It's my leg.

276
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:17,998
<i>It's not just crush syndrome you
gotta worry about, okay?</i>

277
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:19,738
There's gas leaks. There's fire.

278
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:21,647
We can never rule out
secondary collapses,

279
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,086
<i>no matter how much we shore
this thing up.</i>

280
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:24,627
You think chopping
off someone's limb

281
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:26,467
inside a pile of
dirty rocks is safe?

282
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:28,041
Sepsis, fat embolism, a hemorrhage.

283
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,848
Those risks are nothing
compared to the risk

284
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:31,991
of this thing coming down again.

285
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,497
<i>Captain, he's a jerk.</i>

286
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:35,071
But it's what the patient wants.

287
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,610
<i>Can we please</i>

288
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,289
just give it a couple more hours?

289
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:43,858
Yeah.

290
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,352
I gotta get up to triage.

291
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:53,616
Thank you, doctor.

292
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:55,324
House.

293
00:16:55,324 --> 00:16:58,370
You don't need to thank me.

294
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,613
Just makes sense.

295
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:03,158
Just promise me you won't
let them cut off my leg.

296
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,333
I promise.

297
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,577
Does that make you feel better?

298
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:09,719
For some reason, it does.

299
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,909
Your phone is working down here.

300
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,119
Switched carriers.
Better rollover minutes.

301
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,357
Talk.

302
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:20,063
Mri was clean, but afterwards,

303
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,072
he started bleeding out
of his eyes and nose.

304
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:24,348
So there was something
wrong before the collapse.

305
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:27,094
Unless it's just conjunctive
coagulopathy from the trauma.

306
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:29,236
Yeah, yeah, yeah--you don't
think he was sick before.

307
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,709
<i>We get it! You're wrong.</i>

308
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:31,780
Brain infection?

309
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,689
Sorry I'm late.

310
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:35,832
<i>Where were you? Physical therapy.</i>

311
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:37,605
I left my phone in my locker.

312
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,816
<i>The infection causes neurological symptoms,</i>

313
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:41,458
goes systemic, and D.I.
C. xauses the bleed.

314
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,764
<i>Good theory.</i>

315
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,305
Except for the part
that there's no fever.

316
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:46,212
<i>Get an X-ray venogram.</i>

317
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:48,154
See if you can find a
reason for your existence.

318
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:50,330
<i>Also look for venous sinus thrombosis.</i>

319
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,937
Would have seen it on the mri.

320
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,912
Not if you were too
busy not looking for it.

321
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:56,188
We should X-ray for a
facial fracture first.

322
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:57,663
This could all be simple trauma.

323
00:17:57,663 --> 00:17:59,169
Just do what I tell you.

324
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:01,312
<i>Be back in ten minutes.</i>

325
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,989
You're leaving?

326
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:05,831
There's a dozen people
here who can save you.

327
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:08,677
I'm apparently the only one
who can save this other guy.

328
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:09,520
W-wait!

329
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:12,593
Don't go.

330
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,106
Hanna's freaking out.

331
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:24,946
She's having a panic attack.

332
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:27,123
She can't breathe.
She's gonna rip out all her ivs.

333
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,495
So calm her down.

334
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:30,169
She wants you.

335
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,613
I'm flattered. Give her oxygen.

336
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,161
They won't let o2 down there.

337
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,202
Fear of explosion.

338
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:39,110
You have to go back.

339
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,818
She needs you, House.

340
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,777
You only came back
because I freaked out.

341
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,052
Right?

342
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,491
Oh, no.

343
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,030
I just realized how...

344
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,312
Big and scary the world is

345
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,296
and how cozy and safe
this little place is.

346
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:13,205
<i>Thank you.</i>

347
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:15,283
I'm sorry I needed you.

348
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,528
Here. Call your husband.

349
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,814
Charlie?

350
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:40,494
<i>I'm here in...</i>

351
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:43,105
<i>They called you?</i>

352
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,687
They're helping me.

353
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:50,906
<i>Are you coming?</i>

354
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:54,690
I don't know how this could happen.

355
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,631
<i>It's your birthday.
I'm so sorry.</i>

356
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:58,740
See? This is why I
lied about the phone.

357
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,147
Your bp is spiking,

358
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:01,688
so you're bleeding faster
from your leg wound.

359
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:03,395
I'm gonna have less
time to save it.

360
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:04,734
<i>Hang up.</i>

361
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:07,648
Okay. Okay, they're
telling me I have to go.

362
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,347
That was stupid of me.

363
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,193
It was nice.

364
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:21,408
I don't see that
as a contradiction.

365
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:24,020
He was already on his way.

366
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,661
He was in Baltimore,

367
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:28,307
and they all saw it on the news.

368
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:31,085
How many people were hurt?

369
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:35,037
What did I tell you about not
raising your blood pressure?

370
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,663
Can I ask what's
wrong with your leg?

371
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:42,136
Crane fell on it.

372
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,848
Small world.

373
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:47,591
You could have just said no.

374
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:51,609
I'll remember that for
my next human contact.

375
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:56,229
Would you pray with me?

376
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:56,982
No.

377
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,885
<i>I'm not in the habit
of encouraging</i>

378
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,397
my patients' superstitions.

379
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,070
How is that a habit?

380
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,188
You plan on getting trapped
under a building again?

381
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,700
I don't believe in God.

382
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,512
I don't either.

383
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,028
Please?

384
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:35,976
I always thought...

385
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,884
<i>If I did the right thing,</i>

386
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:40,094
if I treated people right,

387
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:44,180
then good things
would happen to me.

388
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,189
You think that's how it works?

389
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,014
I didn't use to.

390
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:54,458
Then recently I tried...

391
00:21:56,903 --> 00:21:59,212
Now I don't know.

392
00:22:04,778 --> 00:22:06,786
<i>Good news.</i>

393
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,138
Advancing catheter

394
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:13,112
through interior jugular vein.

395
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:16,055
You told House you were at therapy.

396
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:18,797
Did you transcribe
the entire meeting?

397
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,341
Entering the cavernous sinus.

398
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,812
Your therapy's on thursdays.

399
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:24,754
Got rescheduled.

400
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:26,193
Injecting dye.

401
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:27,667
Really?

402
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,018
I'm not gonna rat you out.
We're friends.

403
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,568
Just wanna make sure you're okay.

404
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:40,087
No filling defects.

405
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,604
Don't worry.

406
00:22:43,604 --> 00:22:46,281
I'm okay.

407
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,068
You think we can be friends

408
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:53,312
when I get outta here?

409
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:55,219
Yeah.

410
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:56,995
We'll catch a ball game or...

411
00:22:56,995 --> 00:22:58,868
Group sex show or something.

412
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:01,012
Put the cribbing in there.

413
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,996
Okay, now when the
beam starts lifting,

414
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:07,406
you're gonna feel pain.

415
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:09,080
It's gonna be like your
foot's gone to sleep

416
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,353
times a billion.

417
00:23:10,353 --> 00:23:12,027
You'll notice that
I'm waiting till now

418
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:13,365
to tell you.

419
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:15,641
All right. We're ready.

420
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:18,420
Lifting.

421
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,107
I'm feeling the pain already.

422
00:23:23,107 --> 00:23:24,445
<i>That's good.</i>

423
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,717
<i>That means the pressure's coming off.</i>

424
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:27,893
Much closer to getting out of here.

425
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:29,400
Aah!

426
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:32,915
Come on.

427
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:35,327
Pull her out.

428
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:36,499
Come on!

429
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,111
It's moving!

430
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:43,697
Pull hard! Pull!

431
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:45,338
Aah!

432
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,533
Hanna.

433
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:21,200
Hanna! What the hell happened?

434
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,685
I think the adjacent beam
snapped during the lift.

435
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:26,562
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

436
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:29,040
<i>We had a secondary collapse.</i>

437
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,951
<i>We're all right.
How are you guys?</i>

438
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,927
<i>Rescue one, copy the mayday.</i>

439
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:34,704
<i>Main tunnel is fine.
Rescue's on the way.</i>

440
00:24:34,704 --> 00:24:37,416
Lift this up.

441
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,454
One, two--

442
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,447
Kit. Gimme the Kit.

443
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:53,355
All right.

444
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:55,432
No breath sounds on the left side.

445
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:57,040
Tension pneumothorax.

446
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,555
Okay, Hanna. One of
your lungs is collapsed.

447
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:03,401
I'm gonna have to
reinflate it, okay?

448
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,187
Uh...

449
00:25:16,562 --> 00:25:17,799
<i>Hey.</i>

450
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,172
You better get back up top

451
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:21,449
and make sure you
didn't Nick an artery.

452
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:31,091
I'm gonna have to go.

453
00:25:34,472 --> 00:25:36,948
That's okay. You're all right.

454
00:25:38,891 --> 00:25:41,469
You're lucky this isn't worse.

455
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:44,283
You know who's even luckier?

456
00:25:44,283 --> 00:25:46,160
You and just about
every other human being

457
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,737
Who wasn't down there.

458
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:50,344
What did the venogram say?

459
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:51,547
<i>Clean.</i>

460
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:53,285
Now the guy's starting
to spike a fever.

461
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,555
Subarachnoid bleed.

462
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,697
Meningitis? He didn't
say his neck was sore.

463
00:25:57,697 --> 00:25:59,136
That's 'cause everything's sore.

464
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:02,550
He just took a 15-story
swan dive into concrete.

465
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,525
<i>Do an lp. We also have to
consider other infections.</i>

466
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:05,965
So you're suggesting we do an lp.

467
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,304
I guess I am.

468
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:08,777
Genius.

469
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,684
Hey, bad news.

470
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:12,827
Because of the collapse,
we can't try the airbag again

471
00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:15,100
until we get
everything off the top.

472
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,840
<i>Be five, six hours at least.</i>

473
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,179
Then we have to amputate.

474
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:18,932
No.

475
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:21,192
<i>It's been four hours already.</i>

476
00:26:21,192 --> 00:26:23,837
It used to be a long shot.
Now it's...crazy.

477
00:26:23,837 --> 00:26:26,581
Crush syndrome is basically
a buildup of potassium.

478
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:28,958
If we remove potassium-- we're already
treating with sodium bicarbonate.

479
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,699
But not with glucose and Insulin.

480
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:32,005
We have glucose in the Kit.

481
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,880
There's gotta be a
diabetic here somewhere.

482
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,086
<i>You wanna dose the Insulin</i>

483
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:37,329
here in a non-hospital setting?

484
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,639
That is insane! It's not worth it.

485
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,481
Really? 'Cause I think

486
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:44,058
I'm the only one here who
knows what a leg is worth.

487
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:46,737
And fortunately, you're not
the one in charge--he is.

488
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:48,445
And he knows that I'd
testify against him

489
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:49,782
if Hanna sues for cutting off a leg

490
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:52,123
without exhausting every option.

491
00:26:52,123 --> 00:26:54,569
Give us a minute?

492
00:26:57,956 --> 00:26:59,363
I know you're angry,

493
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:01,372
but please don't put
her life at risk

494
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:02,845
just to get back at me.

495
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:06,094
Really? Wow.

496
00:27:06,094 --> 00:27:08,003
So this is all about you now.

497
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:10,480
You took her side against me

498
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,186
right after you heard
about my engagement.

499
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:13,793
Yeah. That must be it.

500
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:15,366
It's not that you're a
pathetic narcissist.

501
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:17,643
I don't love you.

502
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:20,421
So just...Accept it

503
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:21,727
and move on with your life

504
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:23,266
instead of making
everyone miserable.

505
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,907
That's great.

506
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:27,049
A life lesson from a
middle-aged single mom

507
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,420
who's dating a man-child.

508
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,727
Screw you.

509
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:33,037
I'm sick of making excuses for you.

510
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:36,418
I'm sick of other people
having to tiptoe around you

511
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:37,791
and make their own lives worse

512
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:41,475
while they try to keep
you from collapsing.

513
00:27:41,475 --> 00:27:44,353
I'm done.

514
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:45,893
Fantastic.

515
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:49,405
Just stay away from my patient.

516
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:52,315
What are you clinging to, House?

517
00:27:52,315 --> 00:27:55,159
You're gonna risk her
life just to save her leg?

518
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,430
Really worked out well
for you, didn't it?

519
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,069
<i>What do you have in your life,
honestly?</i>

520
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:00,775
<i>Tell me.</i>

521
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:02,280
I'm moving on.

522
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,322
Wilson is moving on.

523
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:06,531
And you...You've
got nothing, House.

524
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:08,506
<i>Nothing.</i>

525
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:10,547
I'm going down there,

526
00:28:10,547 --> 00:28:14,396
and I'm gonna convince her
to let me cut her leg off.

527
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:16,941
<i>If you have any decency left,
you'll just stay out of it.</i>

528
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:25,226
No.

529
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,830
Dr. House promised.

530
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,671
If there was any other way...

531
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:34,853
It doesn't hurt right now.
I can wait.

532
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:39,773
Dr. House.

533
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:40,857
Tell her.

534
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:46,462
Hanna...

535
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:52,731
We have to amputate your leg.

536
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,935
<i>No.</i>

537
00:28:53,935 --> 00:28:56,447
You said... That there was time.

538
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:59,126
There was. And it's run out.

539
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:01,889
No.

540
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:07,161
<i>You asked me how I'd hurt my leg.</i>

541
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:12,150
I had a blood clot,
and the muscle was dying.

542
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,662
And I had all these doctors
telling me I should amputate,

543
00:29:14,662 --> 00:29:17,208
and I said no, and they did this...

544
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,481
Very risky operation.

545
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:20,724
I almost died.

546
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:22,498
But you saved your leg.

547
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:26,785
I wish I hadn't.

548
00:29:26,785 --> 00:29:30,602
They cut out a chunk of muscle
about the size of my fist,

549
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,113
and they left me
with this mutilated,

550
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:36,296
useless thing.

551
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:41,285
I'm in pain...every day.

552
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:43,897
It changed me.

553
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:47,313
Made me a harder person,

554
00:29:47,313 --> 00:29:49,793
a worse person.

555
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:52,073
And now...

556
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:55,295
Now I'm alone.

557
00:30:00,822 --> 00:30:05,508
You don't want to be like me.

558
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:07,953
You got a husband who loves you.

559
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:10,934
You have friends.
You can start a family.

560
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,611
You have a life.

561
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:19,709
And this... This is just a leg.

562
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:37,373
Okay.

563
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:58,637
I can't put you out.

564
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,424
It could depress your
respiration too much.

565
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,665
This should take away
some of the pain.

566
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,800
Will it be quick?

567
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:17,593
I'll use a scalpel to
slice through the skin,

568
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:20,002
muscle, and fat.

569
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:21,843
That should go pretty fast.

570
00:31:21,843 --> 00:31:23,348
Then I'll switch over
to the electric saw

571
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,754
when I get to the bone.

572
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:27,833
It's two bones... About
as thick as a broomstick.

573
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:30,745
Takes about as long to get through.

574
00:31:30,745 --> 00:31:33,591
I'm gonna cut as close
to the concrete as I can,

575
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,135
save as much of your
limb as possible.

576
00:31:36,135 --> 00:31:38,144
Then the orthopedic surgeons
back at the hospital

577
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:41,025
will clean you up,
have you fitted for a prosthetic.

578
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:44,207
You'll be running circles
around me in no time.

579
00:31:50,672 --> 00:31:52,985
How bad will it hurt?

580
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:57,575
Like nothing you've
ever felt before.

581
00:33:04,953 --> 00:33:05,956
Aah!

582
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:50,766
Hanna.

583
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:52,473
Oh...Baby.

584
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:54,282
I'm so sorry.

585
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,826
Shut up. You always loved my legs.

586
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,870
I don't care about your legs.

587
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,846
Baby, I love you.

588
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:02,486
I love you.

589
00:34:02,486 --> 00:34:03,759
I love you. I love you.

590
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:43,495
What?

591
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:44,801
He's fallen into a coma.

592
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:46,407
Lp was clean, but...

593
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:47,948
<i>What are his vitals?</i>

594
00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:49,387
<i>Excuse me, officer.</i>

595
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,591
What do you mean, officer?

596
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:52,230
How long has there
been a cop there?

597
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,904
I don't know. Ten minutes.

598
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:55,981
He was being questioned
when he fell into the coma.

599
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:57,923
Was anything else
making him nervous

600
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:00,004
<i>or worri before his other symptoms?</i>

601
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:01,513
He was claustrophobic
right before the bleed

602
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:03,125
and before the fever.

603
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,269
We told him that he
probably did fall asleep.

604
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,377
<i>Was his bp spiking?</i>

605
00:35:07,377 --> 00:35:09,319
But that didn't cause
his first symptom.

606
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:12,199
Yeah, it did. All the caffeine.

607
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,907
We thought the problem
was in his toilet--

608
00:35:13,907 --> 00:35:15,481
by that, of course,
I mean his head.

609
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,154
<i>Which distracted us
from the fact</i>

610
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:19,364
<i>that it could have been just a clog
in his sewer pipe,</i>

611
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:21,976
<i>and by that, of course,
i mean his spinal cord.</i>

612
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:24,119
And blah, blah, blah, blah.
You get the idea.

613
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,725
An arachnoid cyst
on his lower spine.

614
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:27,199
That's why we missed it.

615
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,538
<i>He's been sitting ten hours a day.</i>

616
00:35:28,538 --> 00:35:30,280
<i>Spiked his spinal fluid pressure.</i>

617
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,787
Run a ct--

618
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:36,909
<i>Bp's 72 over 42.  Hanna?</i>

619
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:38,248
Hanna? I can't breathe.

620
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:40,289
I can't breathe.

621
00:35:43,102 --> 00:35:46,249
Breath sounds bilaterally.
It's not another pneumothorax.

622
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:49,231
Neck veins flat.
There's no tamponade.

623
00:35:51,073 --> 00:35:52,846
Damn it. I waited too long.

624
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,655
Hanna, you've got a
clot in your lung.

625
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,195
I'm gonna fix this.

626
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,003
Iv streptokinase.

627
00:35:58,003 --> 00:36:00,547
What's happening. What's going on?

628
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:03,092
Her body won't get any oxygen
unless we can bust the clot.

629
00:36:03,092 --> 00:36:05,470
<i>This is a blood thinner.</i>

630
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:10,259
Is she gonna be all right?

631
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:14,411
It's gonna make her bleed more.
We'll take care of that next.

632
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:21,173
It's not busting the clot.

633
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:23,348
Maybe it's her heart.

634
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:40,054
What?

635
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:42,999
It's not a clot.

636
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,008
It's a fat embolism.

637
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:47,352
From the amputation.

638
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:54,551
<i>Okay. So--so what can we do?</i>

639
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:57,564
Come on.

640
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:02,117
<i>Do something. Please, please,
do something.</i>

641
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:04,059
<i>Come on, guys, do something.
Come on.</i>

642
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:06,872
<i>Come on. Please, come on,
do something!</i>

643
00:37:06,872 --> 00:37:08,981
<i>Come on, do something!
Do something!</i>

644
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:41,244
There's no way to
prevent a fat embolism.

645
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:44,582
Even if you'd done this in an O.R.,

646
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:47,195
couldn't have saved her.

647
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:03,231
You can't blame
yourself for her death.

648
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:05,207
This wasn't your fault.

649
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:06,714
That's the point!

650
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:09,592
I did everything right.
She died anyway.

651
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:13,241
Why the hell do you think that
would make me feel any better?

652
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,924
You shouldn't be alone right now.

653
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,276
You're bleeding.

654
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:33,461
I'm gonna give you a
task as an employee.

655
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:36,506
Get out of my way.

656
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:01,253
What's that?

657
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:06,938
I'm asking for some time off.

658
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,656
What's wrong?

659
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:17,990
Are you okay?

660
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:21,775
Obviously not.

661
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:08,095
âª âª

662
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:22,649
you going to leap across the room

663
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,726
and grab them out of my hand?

664
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:28,961
<i>No.</i>

665
00:41:30,518 --> 00:41:32,593
<i>It's your choice if you want
to go back on drugs.</i>

666
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:33,848
Okay.

667
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,386
Just so you know,

668
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:41,166
I'm finding it hard
to see the downside.

669
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,714
You need to re-bandage
your shoulder.

670
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:50,739
Is that why you're here?
Foreman sent you?

671
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:51,492
No.

672
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:54,823
You here to yell at me again?

673
00:41:54,823 --> 00:41:55,574
<i>No.</i>

674
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,380
Well, I'm running out of ideas.

675
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,824
Lucas...

676
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:05,401
<i>Oh, great.</i>

677
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:06,740
You're feeling uncomfortable again?

678
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,582
Probably means you just got back

679
00:42:08,582 --> 00:42:10,256
from some quickie wedding in Vegas

680
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:11,529
or you're already pregnant.

681
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,866
I ended it.

682
00:42:15,948 --> 00:42:17,386
What?

683
00:42:17,386 --> 00:42:19,864
I'm stuck, House.

684
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,411
I keep wanting to move forward.

685
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:26,391
I keep wanting to move on,
and I can't.

686
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:29,035
<i>I mean, my new house,
with my new fiance,</i>

687
00:42:29,035 --> 00:42:31,377
<i>and all I can think about is you.</i>

688
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:35,829
I just need to know

689
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:38,238
if you and I can work.

690
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:44,565
You think I can fix myself?

691
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:46,875
I don't know.

692
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:54,041
'Cause I'm the most screwed-up
person in the world.

693
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:55,749
<i>I know.</i>

694
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:59,129
I love you.

695
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:06,795
I wish I didn't.

696
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:08,369
But I can't help it.

697
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:47,643
How do I know I'm
not hallucinating?

698
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:51,358
Did you take the Vicodin?

699
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:52,111
No.

700
00:43:55,643 --> 00:43:59,022
Then I think we're okay.

701
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,654
Yeah.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
