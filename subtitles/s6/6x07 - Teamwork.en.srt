1
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:08,665
This bagel's as hard
as a hockey puck.

2
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:09,733
Then don't eat it.

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,934
Used to be a full
breakfast service.

4
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:12,369
They're trying
to starve us.

5
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:14,171
You're worried
about the food?

6
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:16,473
No, i'm worried about
what the food represents.

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,041
I got seven scenes
to shoot today

8
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:19,810
On half of what
we used to spend.

9
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:20,977
We're going
through a recession.

10
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:22,112
It is what it is.

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,714
But nobody's
gonna bail us out.

12
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:27,017
Free content everywhere,
dvd sales in the toilet.

13
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,719
Now the back office
bean counters

14
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,353
Are vetoing
half my ideas.

15
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:33,657
So we begin to make it
about the performances.

16
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:34,791
You okay?

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,426
A bit of a headache.

18
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,661
If you need
an Ibuprofen--

19
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,296
I need you to put your
game face on, all right?

20
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:41,665
Screw the bagels, screw
the sets, screw the wardrobe.

21
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,734
Do you have any idea
how lucky we are?

22
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,235
We get to do
something we like,

23
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:48,672
We get to touch people's lives
and we get paid for it?

24
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,507
Let's make a movie.

25
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:51,875
Hey, baby.

26
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,550
Roll camera.

27
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:03,353
And...

28
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:06,289
Action.

29
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:11,361
Oh...

30
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:12,896
<i>what's wrong?</i>

31
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:13,930
Ah...

32
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,098
My eyes...

33
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:18,301
They feel like
they're exploding.

34
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,837
All right, turn off
the damn lights.

35
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:24,141
Get an ambulance.
now!

37
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,879
We're gonna be
late for work.

38
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:08,885
Then we'll be late.

39
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:11,688
You took a patient's life,
you lied about it for weeks,

40
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:14,023
<i>you broke who knows
how many laws and oaths</i>

41
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:15,091
<i>to cover it up,</i>

42
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,429
But I can live with it.

43
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:25,368
We can get through it
together.

44
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,738
You have no idea what
i've been living with,

45
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:30,606
And what it means
to hear you say that.

46
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:36,446
But we need to get away
from princeton-plainsboro.

47
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:39,982
You can barely walk by the rooms
where dibala was treated.

48
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,986
<i>why should we live with that
hanging over our heads?</i>

49
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:48,524
If there was ever a time
to turn the page...

50
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,966
Three-month-old with fever,
incessant drooling,

51
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,234
And chronic
muscle weakness.

52
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,169
Or...

53
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:02,572
Porn actor Hank Hardwick,
born Henry Lefkowitz,

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,274
Totally clean workup,

55
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:06,243
Collapsed on the job
with extreme photophobia.

56
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,044
Or...

57
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:09,412
<i>an infant as limp
as a rag doll.</i>

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,047
Yeah. let's wait till
Chase and Cameron get here.

59
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,983
I have a feeling they'll have
the good sense to side with me.

60
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,117
Doesn't matter
who they side with,

61
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:15,218
I'm still in charge.

62
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:17,687
We're taking the limp
three-month-old.

63
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,289
Oh, good.

64
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:22,959
You paged the limpness
specialist.

65
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:30,600
This envelope is oddly
medical license-shaped.

66
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,703
Congratulations.

67
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,675
<i>House is back
in charge.</i>

68
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:40,877
We get to treat
a porn star.

69
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:42,012
Congratulations.

70
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,880
Perfect timing for us.

71
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:45,282
We're leaving the team

72
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:48,451
<i>and the hospital,
effective immediately.</i>

73
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,354
That's kind of sudden.

74
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:52,956
Unless you've been circulating
your resumes for a while.

75
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,225
We're just starting
to think about new jobs,

76
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:56,693
Where we want to live.

77
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,595
Moving too.
interesting.

78
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:00,897
Are you sure about this?

79
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:03,967
Yes.

80
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,002
Uh...
we'll miss you.

81
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,004
We'll miss
all of you too.

82
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:09,673
<i>we'll start clearing
out our things.</i>

83
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:16,947
<i>run an std panel
and a tox screen.</i>

84
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:20,183
<i>send a c-reactive protein
to look for inflammation</i>

85
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:22,552
And an a.n.a. to screen
for autoimmune.

86
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,287
The rest of you
take a history

87
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:26,489
And do an l.p. to rule out
viral encephalitis.

88
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:30,160
Oh, it's just you.

89
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:34,898
Here's hoping you're
good at multitasking.

90
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:39,169
I get tested for stds regularly,
so does everyone I work with.

91
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:40,904
Since i'm guessing you don't
take their word for it.

92
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:44,874
All right, i'm gonna need you to
lie on your side

93
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,078
<i>and put your knees
to your chest.</i>

94
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:50,146
Any history of alcohol
or substance abuse?

95
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:51,147
My wife used to
smoke a little pot,

96
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:53,516
But I never
touched the stuff.

97
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,085
You're married.

98
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,320
Happily,
for two years now.

99
00:04:57,388 --> 00:04:58,722
She happy you do porn?

100
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:01,992
Very, since she
does it too.

101
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:03,426
Hmm.

102
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:05,528
You ever get jealous
when your wife's working?

103
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,897
It's a job.

104
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,532
Once you start
letting your work life

105
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,934
<i>rule your home life,</i>

106
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:12,469
<i>especially if you're
in the same line of work,</i>

107
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,204
Your relationship's
gonna be short.

108
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,005
<i>you're gonna feel
a little pressure.</i>

109
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:18,074
Any history
of sexual abuse?

110
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,442
I defy the cliche.

111
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,712
Have you ever suffered
depression or psychosis?

112
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,880
Let me save you
some time.

113
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,948
There's not a blotch
on my medical record.

114
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:26,449
<i>look...</i>

115
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:28,418
I know most of
the people in my field

116
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:30,687
Are drug addicts
with daddy issues,

117
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,922
But i'm a nice,
jewish boy from the 'burbs.

118
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,990
I wasn't driven to this.

119
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:37,627
I chose it.
i believe in it.

120
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:39,329
I actually
think it's--oh!

121
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:41,798
My arms are killing me.

122
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,933
Looks like tetany.
your muscles are contracting.

123
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,268
Need some
meperidine in here.

124
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:47,337
Oh, god.

125
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:52,008
Jew with megalophallus,
photophobia, and muscle spasm.

126
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:56,413
You tell me which
is the most unusual.

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,681
<i>four candidates,
three slots on the team.</i>

128
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:01,484
Need to know if you've still
got your diagnostic chops.

129
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:03,853
I leave this office
by 6:00 every day,

130
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,422
I have my weekends again,

131
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:06,589
<i>i recognize
my wife again.</i>

132
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,525
Yeah, I agree.
does sound pretty dull.

133
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:09,526
No wonder you want
to work for me.

134
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:11,294
<i>tox screen was clean,</i>

135
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:15,565
We ruled out
viral encephalitis.

136
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:22,138
The only obstacle to you
coming back is your wife.

137
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:27,944
Which has never been that much
of an obstacle to you.

138
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,916
Maybe you're right.

139
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:37,353
The only link between eye
and muscle is the brain.

140
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:42,826
Tumor, seizure...

141
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:45,962
Taub seems to think
the link has to be the brain,

142
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,164
But eye and muscle are
governed by different parts

143
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,066
Of the patient's
second-favorite organ.

144
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:53,269
Which means it's...

145
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:55,505
Thailand was wonderful.
thanks for asking.

146
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:59,075
Of course. yes.
it has to be multifocal.

147
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:00,410
I have an interview

148
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:01,277
With a community health clinic
in two hours.

149
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:02,745
Back-up plan's fine.

150
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,514
Taub's swinging
for the fences.

151
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:05,582
I suggest you don't
divide your attention.

152
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:06,783
Good point.

153
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:09,686
I won't divide
my attention, then.

154
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,554
<i>Taub thinks it's
a brain issue,</i>

155
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:13,189
<i>thirteen thinks
it's multifocal.</i>

156
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:14,591
And neither of them
wants to work here.

157
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:15,992
Don't take
their word for it.

158
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,795
Taub's problem is his wife,
thirteen's problem is you.

159
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:21,798
Chase and Cameron's problem
is the dead african dictator.

160
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:25,034
None of them has
a problem with the work.

161
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:26,536
Cerebral vasculitis
would explain

162
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:28,138
Both the eye
and arm findings.

163
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:31,274
Steroids to treat,
brain angiogram to confirm,

164
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:32,976
Emg and nerve biopsy
while you're at it.

165
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:36,246
I'll be at lunch.

166
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:37,580
I'd hire all four,

167
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:40,817
But a five-person team
seems unwieldy.

168
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:41,985
Who would you turn down?

169
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:45,588
I'll have whatever
he's buying.

170
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:48,625
Two cheeseburgers
and two large fries.

171
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:50,226
There are a thousand people
in the world

172
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:51,794
Who want to be
on your staff,

173
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,563
But you're going after
the four who don't.

174
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:55,665
They don't because
their lives

175
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,067
Are irrelevantly
and annoyingly complicated,

176
00:07:58,135 --> 00:07:59,335
Which makes
them confused,

177
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:01,371
Which makes them
make poor decisions.

178
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:02,939
And your life is simple?

179
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:04,574
You went all the way up
to the medical conference

180
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,142
To cozy up to Cuddy.

181
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,044
Instead she's dating
one of two people in the world

182
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,479
You think of as a friend.

183
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:11,481
There's no way that's
not devastating.

184
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:13,583
So I had an
attraction of sorts.

185
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:16,352
Yeah, the sort in which
your imaginary tryst

186
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,755
Landed you
in a mental hospital.

187
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:19,989
And I got help.

188
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,092
And she got lucas,
who bought me a ginger ale.

189
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,928
It's all fine.

190
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,329
Which won't be true
of my department

191
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:29,899
Unless I can figure out
which doctor i'm not hiring.

192
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,935
I suppose throwing
yourself into your work

193
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,721
Isn't the worst thing
you could do.

194
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:39,559
What is the worst thing
i could do?

195
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,060
House thinks it's
cerebral vasculitis.

196
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:42,595
If you could just
do the brain angio

197
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:43,563
While I finish up
the blood work--

198
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:44,931
We're out the door.

199
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,766
He's got me running every test
and treatment by myself.

200
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,701
Which is why you should
be out the door too.

201
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:52,472
This is completely unreasonable,
even for House.

202
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,408
You owe me this.

203
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:02,282
Thank you.

204
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:04,751
You really believe this is
cerebral vasculitis?

205
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:07,153
Could be.

206
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,956
House wants to thread
a catheter through his brain,

207
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:10,990
Which could cause
a vasospasm,

208
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:12,325
Give steroids,

209
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:13,493
Which could spread infection
all over the place,

210
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,460
Because it could be.

211
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:16,496
Sounds like House.

212
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:18,765
It could also be a severe
vitamin D deficiency.

213
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:21,935
Eats a restrictive diet
works long hours indoors,

214
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:25,705
Became hypocalcemic,
got tetany and photophobia.

215
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,973
Are you saying
i shouldn't do the angio?

216
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,708
House ordered it,
foreman wants it,

217
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,909
Of course
we should do it.

218
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:30,977
I'm just saying
we're right to leave.

219
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,812
You sure?

220
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,315
Because right now i'll basically
do anything you ask me.

221
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:37,550
I'm not interested
in guilting you.

222
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,120
We're moving on.

223
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:44,424
Right after I take the patient
to the phototherapy suite,

224
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:45,758
Blast him
in ultraviolet light,

225
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:49,762
and IV vitamins for his
severe vitamin D deficiency.

226
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,033
So do you guys
actually work together?

227
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:56,135
We did at first,

228
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:58,504
But now we like to keep
our films produced separate.

229
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:01,407
So do you, uh,
watch her work?

230
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,209
We're both busy
with our own stuff.

231
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:05,411
<i>think what you want,</i>

232
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,180
But we're proud
of what we do.

233
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:09,582
Divorcing sex from
all emotional content?

234
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,151
Emotion is emotional.
sex is mechanical.

235
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,687
There doesn't really
need to be any overlap.

236
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:15,989
Certainly not
in your world.

237
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:18,992
We've helped
a lot of couples

238
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,361
By taking sex out
of some deep, dark dungeon.

239
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,229
<i>do what you want</i>

240
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:25,465
Without some big,
moral comeuppance.

241
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:29,135
You think you can escape
the consequences, but you can't.

242
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:31,004
You don't get to make
your own rules or morals.

243
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:36,509
Well, you're here to treat him,
not lecture us about our--hank.

244
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:38,778
Are you all right?

245
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,815
<i>are you okay?
just a nosebleed.</i>

246
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:48,488
Inside his leg?

247
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:49,822
Petechial hemorrhages.

248
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,358
We were wrong.
so was foreman.

249
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:56,145
<i>Patient's blood
won't clot.</i>

250
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:57,312
We're back to square one.

251
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,413
And you're back
in my office.

252
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:00,649
So much for playing
hard to get.

253
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:02,117
We're just here
to help foreman.

254
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:04,353
Is that--

255
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,989
He's not without talent.

256
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,524
Uv rays made the patient's
capillaries more fragile,

257
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:09,958
Hastening
the onset of d.i.c.

258
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:11,093
Sounds like sepsis--

259
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:12,694
But isn't.
no sign of shock.

260
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:14,930
No drop in
blood pressure.
can we turn that off?

261
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:17,232
Right, 'cause Cameron
thinks pornography is evil.

262
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,868
I don't care what he does.
i don't care what you watch.

263
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:21,737
<i>i just think it's annoying
that he pretends</i>

264
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,672
It's some beautiful life
we should all be aspiring to.

265
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:26,675
Left shift points
to bacteremia.

266
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:28,877
No fever.

267
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:30,512
<i>plus it wouldn't explain his
spasmodic muscle contractions.</i>

268
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,482
The ball and chain
smacked you down.

269
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,717
<i>But widespread
petechial rash,</i>

270
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:38,587
Nervous system
involvement.

271
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:40,222
It's some kind
of blood infection.

272
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,457
Meningococcemia.

273
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:46,261
Start the patient
on heparin for the d.i.c.

274
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,130
<i>broad-spectrum antibiotics
for the meningococcemia.</i>

275
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:51,867
Dr. Cameron.

276
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,138
Chase is relaxed, at ease,
in lockstep with you again.

277
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:59,374
I guess he finally told you
that he iced idi amin jr.

278
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,576
<i>does that mean
he can break</i>

279
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:03,378
<i>the other nine
commandments too?</i>

280
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:04,847
Taking the lord's
name in vain, sure,

281
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:06,381
But coveting
thy neighbor's wife?

282
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:07,382
Is she hot?

283
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,618
I've forgiven him.

284
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:11,920
Not for murder.
not you.

285
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:14,923
<i>doesn't matter
how evil dibala was.</i>

286
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:16,158
By every
conscience-hugging,

287
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:18,193
Mother teresa-loving
bone in your body,

288
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:20,329
You should be leaving him,
not leaving with him.

289
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:22,931
I thought your position
was our leaving is a ruse.

290
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,366
We're not talking
about my position,

291
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:25,400
We're talking about yours,
which doesn't add up.

292
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:26,769
Here's what
doesn't add up.

293
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,137
If you were serious
about staffing your team,

294
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:30,372
You would know exactly
which three fellows you wanted.

295
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,007
<i>you plowed ahead
with this case</i>

296
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,475
<i>even though you hadn't
hired new fellows</i>

297
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:36,345
Because you knew foreman
would ask Chase and me to help,

298
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:38,547
Giving you more time
to blow up our marriage.

299
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:40,716
I don't want that.

300
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,384
But we'd be foolish
not to plan ahead.

301
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:47,890
<i>a--my firing Chase was the only
reason you left two years ago,</i>

302
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:50,392
B--when the full horror
of his homicide hits you,

303
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,860
Your marriage
will blow up.

304
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,629
And z...

305
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:57,466
The only obstacle to you
working here will be gone.

306
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:02,838
Or maybe I skipped
a couple of letters.

307
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:07,476
Meningococcemia's
spread person-to-person.

308
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:08,811
Something you
ought to think about

309
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:10,946
Next time you
show up for work.

310
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,982
It's okay.
your wife's not here.

311
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,084
I'm just
telling you what--

312
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:18,787
You have to lecture me
when she's around, I get it.

313
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:21,089
But I can tell from all
the questions you ask

314
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,691
That you're more like me
than you admit.

315
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,027
I'm a guy.

316
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,729
I look around every once
in a while, but I love my wife.

317
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:29,331
I love the fact
that she's the only one

318
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,465
That i'm intimate with.

319
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,768
And no part of you
wants to just

320
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:35,504
Toss this rule book
everyone's forced on you?

321
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:38,674
No part of you wants a life
of actual commitment?

322
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:42,144
Is my relationship
perfect? no.

323
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:45,147
Am I ever horny when my wife
has just had sex for nine hours?

324
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:48,250
Yes.

325
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:49,585
But we are committed
to each other,

326
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:51,220
In every way
that matters.

327
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,021
In other words
you're committed,

328
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:55,123
Except when you're
not committed.

329
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:57,326
Doesn't work so well
if you have a conscience.

330
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:59,528
Conscience.

331
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:00,896
You mean that thing
that kicks in

332
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:02,831
When there's no logical
reason to behave

333
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,067
The way people
want you to?

334
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:07,803
<i>what?</i>

335
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,472
You have a fever.

336
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,543
Means the antibiotics
aren't working.

337
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:17,512
Mr. takayama.

338
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,681
Yes.

339
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:21,850
I'm really happy with what
the last guy did with my eyes.

340
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:24,086
<i>but why would
broad-spectrum antibiotics</i>

341
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:26,955
Fail to work on
meningococcemia?

342
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:28,423
If you'll excuse me,
i've got a real patient.

343
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,993
Mister...

344
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,994
Hitler.

345
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:33,562
Really.

346
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,964
Had to do something to amuse
myself while your receptionist

347
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:37,232
<i>fought with
her boyfriend.
who's next?</i>

348
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,368
A guy who needs

349
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:41,370
Two decades' worth of corn chips
hoovered out of his neck,

350
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:43,305
<i>or a guy who can't
stand daylight,</i>

351
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:45,007
And whose blood
won't clot.

352
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:46,675
You do the triage.

353
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:47,976
Who's the jerk?

354
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:50,212
Someone with zero chance
of hiring me back.

355
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,880
I told you.

356
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:53,916
I'm content at home
and at work.

357
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:55,918
But you're not
content with content.

358
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:58,186
<i>that's why you got sucked
into those stock scams,</i>

359
00:14:58,254 --> 00:15:00,122
Why you cheated
on the wife you love.

360
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:03,091
At bridge.

361
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:06,328
My wife and I play
a lot of bridge.

362
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,296
Why you worked on a case
last time I was here.

363
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:08,363
I gave you a theory.

364
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:09,598
Just like i'd help
a guy who needs

365
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,100
A heimlich
in a restaurant.

366
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,602
<i>and then I shut
the door behind you.</i>

367
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,970
But you'd knock over three other
doctors to give it to him.

368
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,305
Metaphorically speaking,

369
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:17,506
You're a heimlich addict.

370
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:18,774
And you're an
addiction addict.

371
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:20,442
Right now your drug
of choice is your old team,

372
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,177
And like any addict
you're trying to solve

373
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:23,378
Some other problem
and it's not gonna work.

374
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:25,113
If you'll excuse me,
i have a--

375
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:27,883
You have a tight schedule
of nose jobs and tummy tucks.

376
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:29,284
Yes. I do nose jobs.

377
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:30,786
Just like the guy who
came here after a car crash,

378
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:36,792
Couldn't even
breathe through his...

379
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:40,028
Antibiotics wouldn't
work if his sinuses

380
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,630
Were infected
and clogged.

381
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:42,898
If there was
a pocket of bacteria

382
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:45,767
His blood vessels
couldn't reach.

383
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,537
You surgically drain his
sinuses, the drugs will work.

384
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:52,240
Nice.

385
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:53,675
Tell me that
didn't feel good.

386
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:57,746
See you tomorrow.

387
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:01,283
Not coming back.

388
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:13,462
Looks like quite a trip.

389
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:14,963
It was.

390
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:17,399
House send you
to talk to me?

391
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:18,567
No.

392
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:20,602
Then there's nothing
to talk about.

393
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,105
I don't want
to work for him.

394
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:26,875
You're a great doctor.

395
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:29,311
House is right
to want you in the mix.

396
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,146
Are you saying this because
you still have feelings for me

397
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:32,247
And you want me
to come back?

398
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:34,182
I'm saying that
shouldn't be an issue.

399
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,518
Do you have feelings
for me or not?

400
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:39,154
I don't want our work life

401
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:41,156
To have anything to do
with our personal life.

402
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:42,924
You couldn't
keep them separate.

403
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:47,029
And that's why
our personal life doesn't exist.

404
00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:48,830
None of that has to--

405
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:51,199
I can't work with you.

406
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:55,237
Actually, you can.

407
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:58,106
I was the one
who had the problem.

408
00:16:58,174 --> 00:17:04,046
I don't anymore.

409
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,918
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>

410
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:12,287
I was wr-rr-r...

411
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:14,389
I was wrr-r-rr...

412
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:16,925
What were you
wrong about?

413
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:21,663
You spent weeks elaborately
concealing the fact that you...

414
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:23,598
Crashed daddy's car.

415
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,600
<i>and then you
just confessed.</i>

416
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:29,304
<i>seemed idiotic.
certain to end in disaster.</i>

417
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,606
<i>instead you're riding off
into the sunset together.</i>

418
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:33,075
Any theories on why?

419
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,509
<i>i assume you've already</i>

420
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:36,044
Dismissed the
"she loves me" theory?

421
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:38,547
Well, it's possible.

422
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:40,549
It would require
the presupposition

423
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:41,950
That everything she's done
for the last six years

424
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,585
Has been completely inconsistent
with her character,

425
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:45,587
But yeah, it's possible.

426
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:46,855
<i>and as we've
already established,</i>

427
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:49,591
It's also possible
that you're wrong.

428
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:51,526
Or there's
another explanation.

429
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:54,029
Since you don't have one,
i'm gonna keep looking for you.

430
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:02,838
Let him drain, then pack it with
anesthetics and sterile gauze.

431
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:06,441
Do you have any idea
what's going on with House?

432
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:09,277
Uh, he's trying to get
his old fellows back?

433
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:11,313
It's called stalking.

434
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,915
I am way too busy to play
officer of the court.

435
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:17,486
That's a shame, since you're
the one who triggered this.

436
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:20,322
What do you see
in lucas anyway?

437
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:21,690
I don't see that it's
any of your business.

438
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:23,758
Did you think House
wouldn't find out?

439
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:25,560
You could've at least told me
so I wouldn't have coached him

440
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,796
On how to prove
his worthiness to you.

441
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:29,097
I know you're
upset with me

442
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:31,233
Because I didn't choose
to date your best friend.

443
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,069
But i'm living my life.

444
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:36,238
And for the first time
i'm not gonna change that

445
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:42,110
Because of how it might
affect him or you.

446
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:49,818
I feel like crap.

447
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:53,188
Yeah, look, our relationship
is gonna be about House,

448
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:56,024
Or it's gonna
be about us.

449
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:57,359
I vote for it
being about us.

450
00:18:57,426 --> 00:19:00,195
Well, House is gonna
make it about him for us.

451
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:02,264
This is very insulting.

452
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:03,765
You're apparently
shocked by this,

453
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,267
Which means that you
thought that there

454
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:07,235
Was some way
that we could date,

455
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,804
Get married,
have two kids, a dog,

456
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:12,140
Retire to florida,
all without House finding out.

457
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:16,011
Or you thought that
we wouldn't date all that long.

458
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:18,046
First means
you're delusional.

459
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:19,648
The second means
i'm delusional.

460
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:21,383
Technically
it could also mean

461
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,951
You thought House
had matured,

462
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,819
But then we're back
to your being--

463
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,222
Shut up.

464
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,791
You're right.
i'm sorry.

465
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:32,060
I'm also flattered.

466
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,763
Yeah, 'cause you acted all cool
and everything with wilson,

467
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,799
But you feel comfortable enough
with me that you can freak out.

468
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:41,036
That's cool.

469
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,375
<i>His sinuses are clear.</i>

470
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:50,712
Antibiotics should
work this time.

471
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,982
Why did you forgive me?

472
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:58,253
I mean, i'm--i'm glad.
i'm grateful, but i'm confused.

473
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,454
You've been harder
on the patient

474
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:00,722
Than you've been on me.

475
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,191
Well, the difference
between you and the patient

476
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:05,193
Is that you feel shame.

477
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:07,062
Guilt.

478
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:09,297
That's how I know
we're gonna get through this.

479
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:16,738
My stomach.

480
00:20:16,806 --> 00:20:18,006
<i>it really hurts.</i>

481
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:20,041
Oh...

482
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,883
His liver's failing
and his abdomen

483
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:28,284
Keeps filling
with fluid, so--

484
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:29,719
It's not meningococcemia.

485
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:32,788
No matter how much you finish
each other's sentences,

486
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,725
Don't count on being
a diagnostic package deal.

487
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:37,260
Patient's liver's
not working.

488
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,395
We don't have time
for your little team-stakes.

489
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:42,832
Sometimes you're
just wr-rr-r-wrong.

490
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,568
<i>something genetic,</i>

491
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:46,769
Something in his
family history we overlooked?

492
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:48,037
History and genetics
are spotless.

493
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:49,238
Plus every time he had
a bad cough as a kid

494
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:50,406
He went to a doctor.

495
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:52,475
Klatskin tumor obstructing
his bile ducts?

496
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,243
No jaundice.
wouldn't have ocular effects.

497
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:56,746
<i>But if it's inflammation
inside the bile channels,</i>

498
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,381
Sclerosing cholangitis.

499
00:20:58,448 --> 00:20:59,549
<i>Could've stopped
him from producing</i>

500
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:01,050
Clotting proteins,
damaged his blood cells,

501
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:02,418
<i>causing small strokes.
Enough!</i>

502
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:03,753
Enough!

503
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,090
Stop pummeling
thirteen and taub.

504
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:09,892
It fits.

505
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,328
Prep the patient
for an ercp.

506
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,529
See if there's any hope
of opening

507
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:14,931
His blocked
bile channels.

508
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:18,167
And tell him to start looking
for a liver donor.

509
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,670
Dr. Chase.

510
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,239
Your turn.

511
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:25,241
So what'd she say?

512
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,245
She forgave me
because I feel guilty.

513
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:31,480
That works too.

514
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:33,983
And now you expect me to ask you
what the "too" refers to.

515
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:36,352
Only if you're
interested.

516
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,190
Only if you have doubts
about her answer.

517
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,660
She thinks that you don't have
anything to feel guilty about,

518
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:45,561
Because you didn't
kill anybody.

519
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:48,130
I did.

520
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:50,266
She blames me
for dibala's murder, not you.

521
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:53,202
You were barely involved
in that case. she knows that.

522
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,304
But I created
the big, bad, evil climate

523
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:56,505
That allowed it to happen.

524
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:58,374
You're wrong.

525
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,509
Powerful
counter-argument.

526
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:01,644
Why are you doing this?

527
00:22:01,712 --> 00:22:03,479
Why are you trying
to screw things up?

528
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:06,749
You got the tense wrong.

529
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:08,184
Things are already
screwed up.

530
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:10,152
Which is why you don't just
want to work for me,

531
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,754
You need to.

532
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:13,689
Cameron thinks you're
my personal sock puppet.

533
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:17,493
If you don't stay, it's gonna be
hard to prove you're not.

534
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:19,128
I have to go.

535
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:35,878
Last week, my cane could
only do ten minutes.

536
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:40,249
What are you doing here?

537
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:46,188
Waiting for you to take a nap
so I can surge into the lead.

538
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:51,294
What's the best way
to restore the liver in someone

539
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,295
<i>with sclerosing
cholangitis?</i>

540
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:53,229
Not getting
drawn into this.

541
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,563
You already are.

542
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:56,065
Because you crashed
my workout?

543
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:57,166
You're doing
core training.

544
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:58,501
Which improves balance,

545
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:00,870
Which staves off
the most debilitating

546
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:02,605
Symptoms of huntington's.

547
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,708
<i>you've ended your
self-destructive streak.</i>

548
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:07,243
Want to do
something significant,

549
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:08,678
Something that'll
last longer

550
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:11,113
Than the few years
you have left.

551
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,383
My team is your
first-best choice.

552
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:16,385
My first choice is
the community health clinic

553
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:17,720
I interviewed
with yesterday.

554
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,256
Absolutely,
you should do that.

555
00:23:20,324 --> 00:23:22,491
<i>three hours a week.
every doctor should.</i>

556
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,893
<i>'cause every doctor can.</i>

557
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,895
But you don't want
to be every doctor.

558
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:27,930
<i>plus, on my team,</i>

559
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:30,199
You get to screw
with foreman.

560
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:31,834
Every way but literally.

561
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:34,303
Why are you
doing it this way?

562
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,539
You're pretending to assume
we're all coming back

563
00:23:36,606 --> 00:23:37,973
Without actually
asking us.

564
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,141
Why?

565
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,343
See, this is why
you'd be miserable

566
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,380
Wiping noses in a clinic.

567
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:47,416
You can't ask because
you can't face the rejection.

568
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:49,151
Why not?
what's going on?

569
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,619
Are you asking me
to ask you?

570
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:54,623
I'm saying you shouldn't,
for your sake as well as mine.

571
00:23:57,461 --> 00:23:59,028
<i>We don't know how much
the sclerosing cholangitis</i>

572
00:23:59,096 --> 00:24:00,629
Has damaged your liver.

573
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:03,799
It might be in a year,
it might be in ten.

574
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:07,136
But the odds are you're
gonna need a new one.

575
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:09,605
And you should know,

576
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:12,942
While no transplant committee
will say this openly,

577
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,610
<i>they'll never
grant an organ</i>

578
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:18,514
<i>to someone working
in your profession.</i>

579
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,383
You're saying
i have to change jobs?

580
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,420
You're medically
advising me to change jobs.

581
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:26,222
Hank, if you're
too sick--

582
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:27,957
She wants me to have some kind
of religious conversion.

583
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:29,992
She's practically
salivating over it.

584
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,560
I'm just being
candid about--

585
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:33,329
So you don't
think i'm scum.

586
00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:35,464
<i>just some committee
thinks i'm scum.</i>

587
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:37,967
That your
lifestyle has risks.

588
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:40,536
You work around more sick people
and germs and blood than I do.

589
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,705
<i>i'm not gonna live
my life afraid</i>

590
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,373
Like my parents did.

591
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,308
Barely letting me
play outside

592
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:48,878
And god forbid
that I get a scratch.

593
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,080
I'll talk to him.

594
00:24:51,148 --> 00:24:52,915
He'll calm down and realize
that this is the only--

595
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:53,783
<i>No.</i>

596
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,284
No, I won't.

597
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:57,086
Why does everyone want to
dictate the way I live my life?

598
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:59,755
Because the way we're living
is gonna kill you.

599
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:07,863
<i>Passing
the pancreatic duct...</i>

600
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:09,331
Don't listen to House.

601
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:11,567
You have no idea
what he said.

602
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,035
<i>I know that House
is manipulative.</i>

603
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:15,337
I know that you're in
a vulnerable state right now,

604
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:16,806
And I know that Cameron
wants your marriage to work.

605
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:19,141
<i>so do you.</i>

606
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:21,744
So don't listen to House.

607
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,345
House doesn't
make my decisions.

608
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:26,916
<i>we're in the
common bile duct.</i>

609
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,852
What's that mass?
gallstone?

610
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,324
Can we magnify
times five?

611
00:25:35,392 --> 00:25:38,160
That's not a gall stone.

612
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:40,396
His liver's completely
filled with worms.

613
00:25:42,147 --> 00:25:45,414
<i>You have strongyloides,
also known as threadworms.</i>

614
00:25:45,482 --> 00:25:46,849
They disseminated
all over your body,

615
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,783
Causing all
your symptoms.

616
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:49,585
How'd I get a parasite?

617
00:25:49,586 --> 00:25:53,122
Most likely through sexual
activity, but we can't be sure.

618
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,124
What's the treatment?

619
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:56,893
Two mebendazole pills.

620
00:25:58,961 --> 00:25:59,862
That's it?

621
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,231
You'll be fine.
your liver too.

622
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,636
<i>go back to your lives.</i>

623
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:14,176
You know this is
the doctor's lounge.

624
00:26:14,243 --> 00:26:15,644
I know.

625
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:18,013
It seemed like the place
to read doctors' notes.

626
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:22,718
You are good at it,
by the way.

627
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:25,287
Why are you
reading my charts?

628
00:26:25,355 --> 00:26:28,690
Because i'm worried
about my girlfriend.

629
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:29,658
<i>your girlfriend...</i>

630
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:31,993
Is a male porn star?

631
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:33,362
Oh, no, i'm dating
lisa Cuddy.

632
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:34,596
Seriously?

633
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:35,764
Cool, huh?

634
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:37,265
And if House doesn't
have his team,

635
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,967
That'll make her miserable,
which will make me miserable.

636
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:41,069
Which brings us
to the fact that

637
00:26:41,137 --> 00:26:43,372
You have elevated noting
to an art form.

638
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,507
I see the connection.

639
00:26:45,575 --> 00:26:46,842
Most doctors
write "9:00 a.m."

640
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:48,744
If they scrub in at 9:00
or anything near it.

641
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:50,312
You write 9:03,

642
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,647
And you make little notations
when procedures are delayed.

643
00:26:52,715 --> 00:26:54,483
You're easily impressed.

644
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,352
Well, yeah.

645
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,422
I was, till I saw that you had
virtually stopped writing them

646
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,524
About four weeks ago.

647
00:27:02,592 --> 00:27:03,792
Been busy.
got a backlog.

648
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,260
Yeah...

649
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:06,762
People with
your level of precision

650
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:10,332
Don't really just
"get" backlogs.

651
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,868
No one knows why
you're leaving ppth.

652
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,637
Because it's personal.

653
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:17,105
Well, if something
happened,

654
00:27:17,173 --> 00:27:18,607
I mean,
if you're leaving

655
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:19,875
To get away from
something that you did,

656
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:22,878
<i>or she did,
or both of you did.</i>

657
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:23,812
<i>i mean, emotionally maybe
you want to run away,</i>

658
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,280
<i>but in my experience,</i>

659
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:30,385
If you're staring at a pit bull
in some guy's back yard,

660
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:32,721
You're better off
staying right where you are.

661
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:34,790
Face the problem.

662
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:40,796
That way it can't
bite you in the ass.

663
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:44,533
Thanks for
the folksy wisdom.

664
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,803
Hey, you got any, uh, dirt
on any of the other three?

665
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,172
It'd really help me out.

666
00:27:56,446 --> 00:27:57,546
I thought you said those
two pills was all he needed!

667
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:58,647
Lungs are filling
with fluid.

668
00:27:58,714 --> 00:28:02,317
Suction him
and get him on oxygen.

669
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,123
Patient's lungs are
severely compromised.

670
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:09,858
Liver's still failing.

671
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:11,626
Worms could easily
have been a coincidence.

672
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:13,762
Almost be surprising
if he didn't have 'em.

673
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,697
<i>which means it could be
a hematological problem</i>

674
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:17,532
<i>plus cardiomyopathy.</i>

675
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,168
No, neck veins are flat,
precordial exam was normal.

676
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:22,237
What if it's lymphoma?

677
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:25,373
<i>peritoneal carcinomatosis
explains the liver failure.</i>

678
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:29,444
Paraneoplastic syndrome
explains everything else.

679
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:32,080
Lymphoma it is.

680
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:34,916
Prep him for chemo.

681
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:40,655
Fax Taub and thirteen
the latest update on the case.

682
00:28:40,723 --> 00:28:42,023
Seriously?

683
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:45,694
They have as much right
to know as anyone on the team.

684
00:28:45,761 --> 00:28:47,329
You either like
the diagnosis or you don't.

685
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:50,198
<i>if you don't,
we need to keep talking.</i>

686
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:51,399
If you do,
you need to shut up.

687
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:55,303
What we don't need
is this stupid game.

688
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:04,346
You're mad at House,
but you're not mad at me.

689
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:06,581
Do you want me
to be mad at you?

690
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:08,617
You blame House.
not me.

691
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:10,452
I am mad at House
because he's an ass.

692
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,955
And I am mad at you,
but I don't want to leave you.

693
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:15,991
What I did may be
the worst thing I ever did.

694
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:17,759
It may be the best.

695
00:29:17,827 --> 00:29:20,595
I'm either a murderer or a guy
who stopped a mass murderer,

696
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:23,465
But I did it. me.

697
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:26,067
And even if it destroys me,
i'd do it again today.

698
00:29:26,135 --> 00:29:29,237
You don't mean that.
this isn't you.

699
00:29:29,305 --> 00:29:30,438
I'm not running away
from what I did

700
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:35,544
Because you want to
pretend I never did it.

701
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:39,781
If that's how you feel...

702
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:42,684
Okay.

703
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:46,110
My strategy's not
completely working.

704
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:49,780
All four of them want
to work for me,

705
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,515
But all four of them
have reasons

706
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,083
Why they don't
want to work for me.

707
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,085
How do I get them
to take one from column a

708
00:29:57,153 --> 00:29:59,221
And none from column b?

709
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:05,627
Right.

710
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:07,128
Right, by not
saying anything,

711
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:08,697
You're saying that
the answer is inside me.

712
00:30:08,764 --> 00:30:11,066
The answer has nothing
to do with the question.

713
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,869
Then it's not
technically the answer.

714
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,270
<i>why do you need
three of these doctors?</i>

715
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:16,839
Because I know
they're good.

716
00:30:16,907 --> 00:30:19,842
Other doctors fall into
the "might be good" category.

717
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,544
It has nothing to do
with them being good.

718
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,112
You think they're
idiots half the time,

719
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,246
But they're comfortable.

720
00:30:24,314 --> 00:30:25,748
<i>you feel
abandoned by Cuddy,</i>

721
00:30:25,816 --> 00:30:28,484
<i>so you're reaching out
to people you know for comfort.</i>

722
00:30:28,552 --> 00:30:30,720
Oh, my god, you're right.

723
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,556
I don't need
doctors at all.

724
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,292
I just need
a good friend.

725
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,326
Cuddy's right.

726
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:39,361
<i>maybe, just maybe,</i>

727
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:40,830
If I don't play along,
you'll realize

728
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:43,566
You can't solve a deeper problem
with a surface solution.

729
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:49,171
Would've been more profound
if you hadn't said anything.

730
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:51,741
You okay?

731
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,375
Getting through it.

732
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:55,745
Be a lot easier once
you two are away from here.

733
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,246
Yeah.

734
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:03,686
He's peeing blood.

735
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:05,187
<i>bp's rising.
heart rate's up to 250.</i>

736
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:07,089
He's going into
cardiac arrest.

737
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,760
Charging.

738
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,894
Clear.

739
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:13,095
He's bleeding out.

740
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,830
His body's
completely giving out.

741
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:17,099
Charging. clear.

742
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,035
<i>We've got him
stabilized,</i>

743
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:21,837
But no red cells,
no white cells,

744
00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:23,405
Practically
no platelets either.

745
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:26,275
Mebendazole can cause adverse
effects, but nothing like this.

746
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:30,379
He's been off 'em
since yesterday, anyway.

747
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:34,216
Long passes,
wild guesses, anything.

748
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:35,284
<i>Hypopituitarism.</i>

749
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:38,220
Could cause multi-organ
failure if--

750
00:31:38,288 --> 00:31:39,522
If his thyroid hormone
wasn't completely normal.

751
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:41,290
Renal cell carcinoma.

752
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,526
Renal ultrasound
was clean.

753
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:45,895
I'd say
aleukemic leukemia.

754
00:31:45,962 --> 00:31:47,029
<i>marrow's not making
enough normal cells--</i>

755
00:31:47,097 --> 00:31:48,264
Ablate the patient's
bone marrow.

756
00:31:48,331 --> 00:31:51,433
Find him a donor match.

757
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,402
You want to nuke
the patient's marrow?

758
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,371
<i>he had no evidence
of being anemic</i>

759
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:57,006
<i>or immune-compromised
when he was admitted.</i>

760
00:31:57,073 --> 00:31:58,407
Perfect white count
as well.

761
00:31:58,475 --> 00:32:00,409
<i>Ablation could
kill him</i>

762
00:32:00,477 --> 00:32:01,844
Or leave him defenseless
against an infection that could.

763
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:07,049
Well, then come up
with something better.

764
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,089
He may as well die
while we're treating him.

765
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:15,558
Okay with you if I bring
the other candidates

766
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,227
Into the loop now?

767
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:24,066
The risks are, uh,
they're really minimal.

768
00:32:24,134 --> 00:32:28,370
We'll do a series
of painless injections, and--

769
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:33,142
Excuse me.

770
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,410
The whole thing can be
done as an outpatient.

771
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:54,163
You're leaving
at 11:00 a.m.?

772
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:57,266
Trust me,
case is almost over.

773
00:32:57,334 --> 00:33:00,169
Foreman told me you're
ablating the patient's marrow,

774
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:03,172
On a non-theory that
foreman himself withdrew.

775
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,109
You're gonna
kill the patient.

776
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:12,481
Is this about
me and lucas?

777
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:14,650
I want alternatives
for the patient.

778
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:18,454
So do i.

779
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:27,963
I want to be on the team.

780
00:33:34,437 --> 00:33:37,239
You think that's gonna
save your marriage?

781
00:33:40,243 --> 00:33:45,347
I don't know.

782
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:49,318
Four candidates,
three spots.

783
00:33:49,386 --> 00:33:51,587
I got a tough decision
ahead of me.

784
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:17,514
<i>Hi, Remy,
this is dr. Turner</i>

785
00:34:17,582 --> 00:34:19,850
<i>from the pennsauken
free clinic.</i>

786
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:22,986
<i>we all loved meeting you,
and, well, the job's yours.</i>

787
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:26,523
<i>call me back.
let's pick a start date.</i>

788
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:43,140
I want it
to look natural.

789
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,875
I mean, much younger,
but natural.

790
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:47,077
Can you get rid of
the crow's feet altogether?

791
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:48,912
Or is it better
to leave a trace of them?

792
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,515
I don't look old enough
to have them anyway, do i?

793
00:34:51,582 --> 00:34:52,916
Absolutely.

794
00:34:52,984 --> 00:34:54,284
I do look old enough?

795
00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:58,522
No. what?
i'm sorry.

796
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:02,792
Hang on a second.

797
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:09,766
Why are you here?

798
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:11,268
'cause I think
we're wrong.

799
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:14,171
Which means something's
gonna go wrong.

800
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:17,073
Or right.

801
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:19,009
Takayama here.

802
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:24,447
It's me and thirteen.
stop the ablation.

803
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:26,183
Because?

804
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,250
<i>Those threadworms.</i>

805
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:28,251
Why would his body
have gone to hell

806
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:30,053
Just hours after
they were gone?

807
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:31,488
<i>The worms weren't
hurting him.</i>

808
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:33,823
They were helping him.
he has extraintestinal crohn's.

809
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:36,493
<i>he got it from being
raised in a too clean,</i>

810
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:38,895
<i>too overprotective
of an environment.</i>

811
00:35:38,963 --> 00:35:40,564
<i>It's the hygiene
hypothesis.</i>

812
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:42,132
<i>why there's so much autoimmune
disease in the developed world,</i>

813
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,467
And almost none
in the developing world.

814
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:45,835
<i>The worms were keeping
the crohn's in check,</i>

815
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:47,204
<i>teaching his
immune system</i>

816
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:50,473
What it should've learned
from eating dirt growing up.

817
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,008
Once you killed them,
it started killing him.

818
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:56,046
So his life of filth
wasn't the problem,

819
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:59,282
Clean living was.

820
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,517
Let's start him
on methylprednisolone.

821
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:03,186
And some helminths.

822
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:05,255
Worms.

823
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:08,058
Cool, huh?

824
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,360
Best out of three?

825
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:17,267
<i>have you been a bad boy?</i>

826
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,412
I want to be on the team.

827
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,048
Good news for your wife.

828
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:36,086
Thanks for the sarcasm.

829
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,321
I reorganized my life
to spend more time with her,

830
00:36:38,389 --> 00:36:41,658
But apparently I don't love her
as much as I thought.

831
00:36:41,726 --> 00:36:43,193
Or you love her more.

832
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:46,463
<i>this job gives you
the thrill</i>

833
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,566
You used to find
through philandering.

834
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:51,735
Better to cheat
with a beaker and an mri

835
00:36:51,802 --> 00:36:57,407
Than one of your platinum-blonde
plastic surgery patients.

836
00:36:57,475 --> 00:37:01,311
I'll let you know.

837
00:37:17,895 --> 00:37:22,432
I told House I want
to work for him again.

838
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,168
Stay on the team.

839
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:26,936
You were always more
into it than I was,

840
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:30,373
more interested
in diagnostics.

841
00:37:30,441 --> 00:37:35,745
Unless House was right
about why you want out.

842
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:48,157
Four for four.

843
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:55,865
I was in love with you.

844
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:58,234
I was an idiot.

845
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:00,970
Tried to be like you,
tried to understand you

846
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:05,007
Because I thought
i could heal you.

847
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:09,378
You almost killed
that patient.

848
00:38:09,446 --> 00:38:11,447
If almost not saving
his life means--

849
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:13,683
You knew the diagnosis
a long time ago.

850
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,252
You risked another patient's
life to bait your old team.

851
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,453
Another one?

852
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:19,789
You did kill dibala.

853
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:23,693
By playing god and
teaching us to do the same.

854
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,294
I taught you to think
for yourselves.

855
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:26,629
You don't even think
of them as people.

856
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:30,066
They're just lab rats
for your little puzzles.

857
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:31,667
As you celebrate
their humanity,

858
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:33,002
I'd rather solve those little
puzzles and save their lives.

859
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,971
Motives do matter.

860
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:36,706
Lives can't come second.

861
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:38,775
The patient is alive.
that's what matters.

862
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:40,409
Not to you.

863
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:44,213
All you care about is that taub
and thirteen fell for your game.

864
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:47,216
You'll poison them
just like you poisoned Chase.

865
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:51,954
Your husband killed a patient
and you're breaking up with me.

866
00:38:52,022 --> 00:38:58,094
You ruined him.

867
00:38:58,162 --> 00:39:02,465
So he can't even
see right from wrong.

868
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:08,271
Can't even see the sanctity
of a human life anymore.

869
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:13,242
I loved you.

870
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,412
And I loved Chase.

871
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,016
I'm sorry for you both.

872
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,250
For what you've become.

873
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:24,754
Because...

874
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:28,357
There's no way back
for either of you.

875
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,522
Any idea
where I can get

876
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:37,660
A great, big
"mission accomplished" banner?

877
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:40,363
<i>got my sanity back,</i>

878
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:45,101
My license back,
and now...

879
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:47,069
You're kidding.
all of them?

880
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:49,038
Three out of four.

881
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:50,907
Which is almost as good
as four out of five.

882
00:40:50,974 --> 00:40:52,341
Who was the--

883
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:53,676
Cameron.

884
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:54,844
Wow.

885
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:56,946
<i>i can't believe it.</i>

886
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:59,582
<i>i mean, really.
i can't...</i>

887
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,053
Believe it.

888
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:07,523
You were right, House.
good for you.

889
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:11,627
Yeah, it is.

890
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:15,431
She's broken up with Chase,
and she's leaving the hospital.

891
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:18,968
Still, three out
of four ain't bad.

892
