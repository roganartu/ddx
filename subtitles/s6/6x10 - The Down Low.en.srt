1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:03,598
So I'm thinking 35.

2
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:05,153
Seems high to me.

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,376
That's a fair price
for quality like this.

4
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:10,902
I'll give you 30.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,599
I thought you were joking.
I didn't...

6
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,269
Who am I dealing with here, Eddie?
Him or you?

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,395
Mickey, relax.

8
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,657
Now, if things move forward
with Gorski,

9
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:27,318
he lets us into Philly,
then maybe I cut you a break.

10
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:30,904
You cut me a break now,
or maybe you don't get with Gorski.

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:35,970
Marco...

12
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:38,412
I thought we had an understanding.

13
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:43,000
Tommy, don't be stupid.
Put the gun down.

14
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:44,877
He shows you some respect.

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,213
Hey, you just... listen to your boss,
all right, moron?

16
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,214
Shut up!

17
00:00:49,723 --> 00:00:51,123
Just relax, buddy.

18
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,142
What were you thinking?

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,852
- I didn't shoot him!
- sure?

20
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:05,353
- He's face-down on the pavement!
- I nailed myself in the foot!

21
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:12,792
- I don't think he's hit.
- Then what happened?

22
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:14,198
Let's get outta here!

23
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,230
Come on, Mickey, wake up.

24
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:18,911
Mickey! Wake up!

25
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:25,845
R[H]ésus AB+ Team

26
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,586
.:: La Fabrique ::.

27
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,602
Arrow
ShalimarFox

28
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:57,398
We almost done here?

29
00:01:57,523 --> 00:01:59,952
Assuming you did
this shaving your forehead...

30
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:03,622
Okay, then.
I'm ordering a head C.T.

31
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,916
I don't have a headache.
I'm not dizzy.

32
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,502
- Eddie, I gotta get back.
- You gotta stay here.

33
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,403
We'll straighten out
that mess with Marco tomorrow.

34
00:02:11,528 --> 00:02:12,772
Let the doc do his job.

35
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,574
Actually, stitching you up
is really the E.R. doc's job.

36
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:19,891
Too long of a wait.

37
00:02:21,023 --> 00:02:23,011
Also, a lot of cops in the E.R.

38
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:26,535
Not that you care about that.

39
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,772
So how did this happen?

40
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,360
You're right.
That was a stupid question.

41
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,483
'Cause the answer's kind of obvious.

42
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:39,472
No scrapes on your hands
means you didn't try to break your fall.

43
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:41,533
Means either out cold

44
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,909
or totally disoriented
when you went down.

45
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:47,040
No sign of trauma other than the cut
means no one hit you in the head.

46
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,668
Powder burn on your jacket sleeve

47
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:52,045
means someone shot a gun.

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,430
All right, Eddie.
Come on, let's go.

49
00:02:57,913 --> 00:02:59,850
I don't care what you guys are into.

50
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:03,056
If you don't get this checked out,
it'll happen again.

51
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:05,559
- What will?
- This.

52
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Cool.

53
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:17,112
32-year-old man,

54
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:19,739
recently developed
loud-noise-induced vertigo.

55
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:22,679
C.T. was clean.
No internal bleeding, no edema.

56
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,745
Everything else is in the file.

57
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,872
Cameron get your hair
in the divorce?

58
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,613
This guy strained his back
three years ago. And that's it.

59
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:32,503
All the rest of these pages
are blank.

60
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,087
He won't tell us anything.

61
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:37,007
Understandable,
since he's a drug dealer.

62
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,927
So he's dangerous and withholding,

63
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,637
which you find irresistible.

64
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,764
But guys like that, they never call.

65
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:46,057
He actually said
he was a drug dealer?

66
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:47,601
Not out loud.

67
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,987
But he was wearing
a solid gold Patek Philippe.

68
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:53,607
His friend had a Rolex.
But their phones were prepaid burners,

69
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,768
so they can toss 'em
as soon as they're done.

70
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:58,140
It doesn't matter
if this guy's a drug dealer or not.

71
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,124
Noise-induced vertigo
means ear or brain.

72
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:02,533
Head C.T. was clean,
so I'm thinking acoustic neuroma.

73
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,569
We need to do an A.B.R.
to test his hearing.

74
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:06,282
Acoustic neuroma fits.

75
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:08,372
So does lidocaine toxicity.
Or benzocaine...

76
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,374
Depends
what he's cutting the coke with.

77
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,918
Now he's not just a drug dealer,
he's a cocaine dealer.

78
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:14,294
He seemed peppy.

79
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:17,480
You test his ears.
I'm gonna go test his cocaine.

80
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,926
You think this guy's gonna hand over
a briefcase full of illegal drugs

81
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,430
because you ask nicely?

82
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:23,719
I hope not.

83
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,678
So the best coffee's at Geena's,

84
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,997
and the best pizza is at Gino's.

85
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:35,691
Yeah, and don't mix those up,
because the coffee at Gino's

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,200
could kill ya.

87
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:40,284
- How's the drycleaner on the corner?
- Go two blocks over to eco-clean.

88
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:42,990
The one on the corner
used to shred all my boyfriend's shirts.

89
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,742
- Good to know.
- In retrospect,

90
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,828
I should really thank
those cleaners.

91
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:51,206
We broke up.
This is my stop.

92
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,938
So if you have any more questions
about the neighborhood,

93
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:55,127
I'm your girl.

94
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:58,921
Favorite sushi place.
Maybe we could get dinner sometime.

95
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,091
Sure...

96
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,302
If you promise to bring
that good-looking guy with the cane.

97
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,178
You mean House?

98
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,055
Your boyfriend's name is house?

99
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:10,726
He's not my boyfriend.

100
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:13,504
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,529
What do you call each other?

102
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:17,008
Husband? Partner?

103
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,474
Lover?

104
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,402
We're not gay.

105
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:22,487
Seriously?

106
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:27,009
You're gonna hear a series
of clicks and hisses.

107
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:30,329
Sensors measure electronic activity
to your auditory nerve.

108
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:32,637
How long is this gonna take?

109
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:34,962
An hour, maybe an hour and a half.

110
00:05:35,574 --> 00:05:38,524
Or you could walk away
with a tumor in your ear.

111
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:44,439
- Guy's probably late to a stabbing.
- Impedances look good.

112
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,595
Starting at 13 clicks
per second at 50 decibels.

113
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,222
Check this out.

114
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:54,269
13's middle name is Beauregard?

115
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:57,563
Wave three latency is 3.8.

116
00:05:57,688 --> 00:06:00,609
Slightly delayed, nothing significant.
That's what sticks out to you?

117
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:02,764
House is clearly screwing with us.

118
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,113
- It's a fake paystub.
- Looks real to me.

119
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,617
- She don't make that much money.
- I make that much money.

120
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:13,206
And... apparently, you don't.

121
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:17,167
I need the drugs.

122
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:19,461
We're in textiles.

123
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:21,797
I need the drugs!

124
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,050
Works for Jack Bauer.

125
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,191
Is this really necessary?

126
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,273
The chairs in the hall
are way more comfortable.

127
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:32,224
But way less genre-apopriate.

128
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:34,351
Here's the deal.

129
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,636
I need information.

130
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:39,231
You have reasons not to give me that.
So either I can force it out of you...

131
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:42,609
Or I can't.

132
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:45,696
I wish I could tell ya.

133
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:49,579
Let's work with that.

134
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:53,036
Forget the drugs.
Let's talk about textiles.

135
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:54,904
What's your major product?

136
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:56,248
Is it "H"?

137
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,124
And by that I mean "hosiery".

138
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:00,804
We do more with...

139
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:02,963
culottes.

140
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:05,533
- Is that with a "C" or a "K"?
- C.

141
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,134
Nobody wants "K" anymore.

142
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,301
Does your friend cut the fabric?

143
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,471
No, he's a sales guy.

144
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:13,780
He must cut a culotte
here and there.

145
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,266
No one touches the culottes.

146
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:20,856
I'm sorry.
Can I talk to you?

147
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:24,186
I'm interrogating a suspect.

148
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,173
Make it quick.

149
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:32,701
Everyone in our building
thinks we're gay.

150
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:37,714
We're grown men over the age of 30

151
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,401
who moved in together.

152
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,501
We're two tigers
away from an act in Vegas.

153
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,768
They'll figure out
we're straight eventually.

154
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:46,965
Eventually is not when I want to go out
with the cute girl in 3-B.

155
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,304
Any chance I could
get some water over here?

156
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,846
If only there was some way
to communicate that information to her.

157
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:54,638
Perhaps using, I don't know, sounds.

158
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:58,159
- If only the larynx was capable of...
- She didn't believe me.

159
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:00,434
She sidestepped my dinner invite.

160
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,066
And a woman would only reject you
because she's worried

161
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,277
- that you might not be interested.
- We were chatting, having fun.

162
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,555
- There was definitely a spark.
- When she thought you were gay.

163
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:13,867
You sure your friend isn't secretly...
What is a culotte, anyway?

164
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,799
Pants that hang like a skirt.

165
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:23,585
Mickey hates the stuff.

166
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:26,129
He's one of the few guys I trust

167
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:28,590
to watch the product overnight.

168
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:30,926
They took him away an hour ago.

169
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,227
- You think he's okay?
- It's an ear test.

170
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,886
Pretty sure he'll live.

171
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,945
Pupils are constricted.
Pulse is bounding!

172
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:42,687
Airway's clear.

173
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,147
Need a crash cart!

174
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,617
Gotta be his blood pressure. We need
to get it down before he strokes out!

175
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:49,452
At least we know his ears are okay.

176
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,170
We put the patient on vasodilators,
got his hypertension under control.

177
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:55,796
He got worse here at the hospital.

178
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,706
Means thug life probably
isn't what's making him sick.

179
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,291
Which means we can stop
the bloodhound gang routine

180
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,749
and go back to being doctors.

181
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:06,003
But we're doctors all the time.
It's so boring.

182
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,173
Fine.

183
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,842
- Could be sick sinus syndrome.
- No chest pain, shortness of breath.

184
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,112
Brain aneurysm secondary
to polycystic kidney disease?

185
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:17,564
Normal urinalysis.
Kidney's impalpable.

186
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:19,558
Is... that a new watch?

187
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:22,677
Thought I'd give myself
a little treat.

188
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:25,314
What if it's not his brain,
but it's on the way to his brain?

189
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:26,648
Carotid stenosis.

190
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,820
Get an ultrasound of his carotids.
See if his arteries are clogged.

191
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:41,412
How much money do you make?

192
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:44,511
I want a raise.

193
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,169
And I will be happy to talk about that
at your next review...

194
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,247
in August.

195
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:52,402
I know that you're paying me
less than everyone else on the team.

196
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,135
I can't discuss other people's salaries.
You know that.

197
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,429
Now that they know,
they'll never respect me.

198
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,265
And who told them how much you make?

199
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:03,372
It's not fair for me to make less
than the people I supervise.

200
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:05,362
Salary isn't about fairness.

201
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:07,876
It's about what you can leverage
in negotiation.

202
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:11,070
Which isn't much
without a competing offer on the table.

203
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:13,232
And we both know you don't have one.

204
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:20,752
Ultrasound showed no narrowing
or obstruction in the patient's carotid.

205
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,394
Not that he's worried...
Keeps asking me when he can leave.

206
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,256
<i>... in the business of healing people,
you'd think they'd have better soup.</i>

207
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,930
- You bugged his room?
- Our patient sleeps in the building

208
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:30,694
where they keep their stash.

209
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:33,949
Eventually, he'll say something
that gives away where that is.

210
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,344
- We'll find out what's making him sick.
- But we ruled out environmental causes.

211
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,304
You ruled out environmental causes.

212
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:42,849
And you pretended to agree,
just so we'd take him out of his room

213
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,572
so you could plant the bug.

214
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:46,947
Carotid stenosis was a decent idea.

215
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:49,116
But an even decent-er idea

216
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,378
is that he's got toxins stored
in his fat cells.

217
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:53,385
Every calorie he burns
makes him sicker.

218
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,464
If we're going with toxic exposure,

219
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,262
we should just start testing
for the most likely suspects.

220
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:00,951
Bug's a better idea
than blindly running tests for days.

221
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:06,498
Tell him it'll take weeks.

222
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:09,189
It'll be faster.

223
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,426
- What do you mean weeks?
- These tests take time.

224
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:16,158
- There are a lot of possibilities.
- No, but I can't sit here this long.

225
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,955
I got things I gotta take care of.

226
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,262
If you're worried about the children
going without their drugs,

227
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,266
- I'm sure someone...
- I wanna be discharged.

228
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:26,141
I'll get the forms.

229
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,688
- This is ridiculous.
- Beats sitting in a lab all day.

230
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:47,230
In the lab, there is significantly
less chance of getting killed.

231
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,708
- Slow down.
- We're in a car in broad daylight.

232
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:52,377
- What's gonna happen?
- You think he doesn't have a gun?

233
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,832
That he's gonna use
to shoot doctors?

234
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:56,947
Back off.

235
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:01,845
Well played with the watch,
by the way.

236
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,305
Borrowed it.

237
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,516
- How much longer are we gonna do that?
- Until it's no longer fun.

238
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,896
We all thought he needed
to be taken down a few notches.

239
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,565
So we're just having fun,
not getting even?

240
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,692
Crap.

241
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,530
He's gonna get away.

242
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:27,874
Shut up.

243
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,380
3- B?

244
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,340
You're Nora, right?

245
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,677
You're the one to thank for all the tips
about the neighborhood.

246
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:44,318
Nice to meet you.

247
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:49,351
I hear you thought that wilson and I
liked to polish each other's swords.

248
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,147
And by swords, I mean pistols.

249
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:56,911
- Of course he told you about that.
- Don't worry.

250
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,500
Actually, I'm surprised
that doesn't happen more often.

251
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,654
We're straight.

252
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:10,871
Oh, my... God.

253
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,165
That is beautiful.

254
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:16,336
We finally have the room
to display it the way it deserves.

255
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,633
Would you...
help me get this upstairs?

256
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:23,385
Absolutely.

257
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,440
Nice shoes, by the way.

258
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:28,565
Louboutin?

259
00:13:30,003 --> 00:13:32,144
- You talk to Cuddy?
- Shot me down.

260
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:36,463
- What are you gonna do now?
- I'll wait for my review in August.

261
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:39,109
What?

262
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,756
Nothing.

263
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:42,531
That's what I would do.

264
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:44,154
But I'm a coward.

265
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:53,540
His friend brought him in
15 minutes ago.

266
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:56,262
Temp's 105.
Pulse is weak and thready.

267
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:58,044
He's not making any sense.

268
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,255
It's too much money.
That wasn't the deal.

269
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:01,840
That wasn't the deal.

270
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,186
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Eddie!

271
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:10,145
We gave him antipyretics
and soft steroids to reduce the fever

272
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,548
and prevent organ damage.
He's no longer delirious.

273
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,524
Patient went out,
came back worse than before.

274
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,059
Points us back to environmental,
tied to wherever he went.

275
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,360
No, it doesn't.

276
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:20,609
- Where's Foreman?
- He had a meeting with Cuddy.

277
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,766
What do you mean? We screwed up.
My car was impounded.

278
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:25,891
True, amusing, and irrelevant.

279
00:14:26,956 --> 00:14:29,075
Foreman fall for the paycheck thing?

280
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:36,291
<i>Mazel Tov.</i>
Should be fun to watch.

281
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,044
You're off environmental?

282
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,082
Wherever he went,
it wasn't for long enough.

283
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,673
Add in the fever
and infection's way more likely.

284
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,521
And if it is an infection, his symptoms
suggest it's moved to his brain.

285
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,035
Which means...

286
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,045
We'll do a lumbar puncture.

287
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,836
Next time you're tailing someone,

288
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:58,161
take two cars.

289
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,629
You knew we were following you?

290
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,195
I'm sorry.
I had to lose you.

291
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,905
I had business to take care of.

292
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,908
Right, because you're a businessman.

293
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:13,829
Do you know how many junkies come
to the E.R. with their brains melting?

294
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,673
I'll bet there's more drunks
with their livers giving out.

295
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:18,758
A liquor store owner
laying on this table...

296
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:21,055
I'm guessing
he doesn't get attitude.

297
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:22,837
I hit bone.

298
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:25,343
His old back injury
must have flattened out his discs.

299
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,657
Sorry, but I've got
to try this again.

300
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:28,885
You okay?

301
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:30,720
An adult wants to get wasted,

302
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,469
why is it anybody's business
what substance they use?

303
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:36,393
Because some of those substances
are against the law.

304
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:39,535
So your problem
isn't that it's immoral.

305
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,860
Your problem is that it's illegal.

306
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,902
I got the same problem.

307
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:47,411
I'm in.

308
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:52,997
Look at his heart rate.

309
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:55,245
- It's normal.
- I know.

310
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,516
I ran into Nora this morning.

311
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,796
She told me
about your <i>Evita</i> listening party.

312
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,175
The London and New York recordings
are so different.

313
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:12,434
You were supposed to tell her
that we're straight.

314
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,930
She didn't believe me, either.

315
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,413
You're doing this to mess with me.

316
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,969
Correction. I started doing this
to mess with you.

317
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,168
Now I'm honestly trying to hit that.

318
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:24,359
By pretending you're gay
and in a relationship with me?

319
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,775
We're in a relationship
and we're really unhappy.

320
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:30,071
Communication's never been easy for us.
Probably 'cause we're so closeted.

321
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,199
I got it all figured out.
Nora and I spend the next few weeks

322
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,656
hanging out,
become best girlfriends.

323
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:37,996
I confide in her about our issues.

324
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:40,021
I can't decide if this plan

325
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:42,548
is more despicable or illogical.

326
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:43,918
Then, one night,

327
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,336
we get drunk...

328
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:47,631
Back rub turns into a front rub...

329
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:49,132
The next morning,

330
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,343
"I've never felt this way
about a woman before."

331
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,826
That's... quite a commitment
you've made

332
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:56,097
to jumping the girl
I'd like to date.

333
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:57,998
I'd like to date her.

334
00:16:58,123 --> 00:17:00,101
In the sense that I'd like
to jump her repeatedly.

335
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:01,428
I saw her first.

336
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,146
Seriously?
You're invoking the guy code?

337
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,358
We're guys.
It's a code.

338
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:10,194
You're only bringing this up
'cause you know you're gonna lose.

339
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:12,233
It's not an infection,

340
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:14,911
but it might be
an autonomic nerve disorder.

341
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,660
The hair is still bumping me.

342
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:19,349
Did you get it cut because you're ready
for the next chapter...

343
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:22,084
We stuck a needle
into his spinal bodies twice.

344
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,932
His heart rate stayed normal.

345
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:25,892
If we add that
to his other symptoms...

346
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:28,170
That would be a mistake.

347
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,007
She's never gonna fall for it.

348
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,750
Then, you got nothing
to worry about, sweetie.

349
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:39,516
You're a wuss.

350
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:42,560
Say that when I'm better.

351
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,939
What, are you gonna beat me up?
That sounds stressful.

352
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,983
Maybe you should pop
one of your beta blockers first.

353
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:52,362
- You have a heart problem?
- Medically, no.

354
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,531
He would have told us about that.
Metaphorically...

355
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:09,045
It's an effect from operating
outside of the law.

356
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:12,073
Sometimes, I have to do bad things.

357
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:14,134
And not always to bad people.

358
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,246
Last few months,
that hasn't been so easy.

359
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:23,392
A guy got me the pills.
And they control the stress.

360
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,145
Look, don't say anything to Eddie.

361
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:28,262
All right?
The last thing I need

362
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,513
is the guys thinking
that I've gone soft.

363
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,734
When was your last pill
before we originally admitted you?

364
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,049
The night before.

365
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,867
And we stuck you in here,
you went into beta blocker withdrawal.

366
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,382
That's what caused the hypertension.
When he got out of here,

367
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:43,496
he took a pill,
and the hypertension went away.

368
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:46,499
Which means it was never a symptom.
We take that off the table,

369
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,168
- we've got vertigo, fever...
- And stress.

370
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:50,966
He's been in this game for a while.

371
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:53,555
Either he grew a conscience
over the last few months

372
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,300
or he's producing exceenaline.

373
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,635
Pheochromocytoma.

374
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:02,056
It's Greek for, "you'll be back doing
bad things to good people in no time."

375
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:04,350
M.R.I. his adrenal glands.

376
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,270
You're okay with that? You're not gonna
put a pillow over his face?

377
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:14,027
Great.

378
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:15,824
Cable guy came.

379
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,039
Hi, James.

380
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:26,331
We've got some kung pao left.

381
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:30,043
God. Right there.

382
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,588
We're having a picnic...
with wine.

383
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:37,031
- I'll pour you a glass.
- He doesn't drink.

384
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:39,385
Well, more for us, then.

385
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:43,773
Well...

386
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:46,076
I think I might...

387
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,861
have a little...

388
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:50,688
Kung pao.

389
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,431
How'd it go with Cuddy?

390
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:04,744
She told me I needed leverage.

391
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,802
So...

392
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,499
I told her about an offer I had to help
run the neuro department at mercy.

393
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:16,758
- Are you really gonna take the job?
- There is no other job.

394
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:18,841
I bluffed.
She called it.

395
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,344
I'm not gonna beg to be underpaid.

396
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:24,451
I'm leaving when this case is over.

397
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:28,976
House is lying to you.

398
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,479
I know.

399
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:33,147
And so are you.

400
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,916
It's 2010, I mean...

401
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,610
You know, nobody cares
if you're gay anymore.

402
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:39,821
You don't have to be in the closet.

403
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,822
I'm not...

404
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,776
Look around you. Does this really
look like a place gay men live?

405
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,500
Apart from the poster.

406
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,703
Those stools are our only furniture.

407
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:52,722
There are no window treatments.

408
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:56,588
Well, my ex-boyfriend didn't even know
what window treatments were.

409
00:20:58,078 --> 00:21:00,686
Is that Greg's
Carpenters album or yours?

410
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,387
Look, House hates
musicals and fashion and meringue.

411
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:06,431
This whole thing is an act

412
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:09,142
designed to earn your trust...

413
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,821
In order to sleep with you.

414
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:16,787
- I get it.
- Finally.

415
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:18,985
You're jealous.

416
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:22,193
You know, if you want
to spend more time with Greg,

417
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:24,407
you should just tell him.

418
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,729
You were wrong, M.R.I. revealed no sign
of a pheochromocytoma,

419
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:35,795
means Mickey's stress is just stress.
We're back to vertigo and fever.

420
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,231
And environmental is back at the top
of our list of suspects.

421
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:39,672
{\We're trying to narrow down
the possibilities.}

422
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,133
That receiver doesn't respond
to manual stimulation.

423
00:21:42,496 --> 00:21:44,135
Maybe if you took off your shirt.

424
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,198
I resorted to something more exotic.
I call it reading the instructions.

425
00:21:48,493 --> 00:21:51,684
Turns out if you screw the antennae
into the wrong sockets,

426
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,602
it doesn't actually work.

427
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:57,523
We lost Mickey just outside Trenton.

428
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:05,031
It's supposed to search
for an open frequency.

429
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:08,522
Most buildings there
were built between 1920 and 1940.

430
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:10,221
We're compiling a list of toxins...

431
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:12,374
There's got to be at least
one open frequency.

432
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:21,089
I need a few minutes
with your friend.

433
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,717
Or stay if you want.

434
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:26,525
Rectal exam.

435
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:29,514
I'll check out the cafeteria.

436
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:39,816
Why the beta blockers?

437
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:42,401
What do you mean?

438
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,571
Valium and Xanax
actually reduce stress.

439
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:49,158
Beta blockers just control
the symptoms of stress.

440
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,507
Keep the heart from racing,
hands from shaking,

441
00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:53,526
and all those stage fright issues.

442
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:57,544
That's why some people
take them when they perform.

443
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:02,571
- What the hell is that?
- This is my bug.

444
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:03,673
And this...

445
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,416
This...

446
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,428
This is yours.

447
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:13,391
You bugged your own room?

448
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:15,808
Are you... An informant?

449
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:20,032
An informant would have sold his pals
at the first sign of a sniffle.

450
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:22,228
This guy... is a cop.

451
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,141
I don't see how this is relevant.

452
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,866
In the land of no fun,

453
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:33,285
you got a really sensible
piece of property.

454
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:35,106
Give him a break.

455
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:39,412
Knowing this guy's an undercover cop
doesn't get us any closer to curing him.

456
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:41,214
Good point.
You know what they say.

457
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:43,089
Information is not power.

458
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:44,067
Wait...

459
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:46,819
You're saying we should use
the cop thing to force him to talk?

460
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,771
Force?

461
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:50,556
I'm talking about the womanly
art of persuasion.

462
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:52,715
I said womanly.

463
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:03,652
If you won't talk to us,
we'll find someone who will.

464
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,494
You must have a supervisor.

465
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:06,944
A... Handler.

466
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:08,772
Good luck with that.

467
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,684
You don't know my real name.

468
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:12,867
You don't know
if I'm local or state,

469
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,037
F.B.I., D.E.A.
but, by all means, get on the phone.

470
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,124
I get it.
These guys are lowlifes.

471
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,890
You want them off the street.

472
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,209
They're not just lowlifes.

473
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:24,743
Eddie killed a snitch
three weeks ago.

474
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:26,714
Boss' orders.

475
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:33,387
The boss, he's one of the biggest
cocaine importers in the entire state.

476
00:24:34,077 --> 00:24:36,277
And he wants to expand
down to Philly.

477
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,895
Tomorrow night, he and Eddie

478
00:24:39,237 --> 00:24:40,644
are meeting the big fish.

479
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:42,605
And the cops are gonna bust it.

480
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,720
But if you guys get caught
poking around there,

481
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:48,110
the whole thing gets called off.

482
00:24:48,676 --> 00:24:49,826
That's noble,

483
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,281
but you can't put your life at risk.

484
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:54,867
I've been undercover for 16 months.

485
00:24:56,925 --> 00:24:58,675
I haven't seen my wife...

486
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:01,332
My house, my dog.

487
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:06,559
I have put far too much into this,
and I will not let it fail.

488
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,980
So just...

489
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:14,165
Just keep me alive
for another 24 hours.

490
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,942
And I will tell you
everything you need to know.

491
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:24,038
Can I come in?

492
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:26,524
Nurses out here
can't keep their hands off of me.

493
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:29,902
He's a Casanova!

494
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:33,322
What, you bringing me my sandwich?

495
00:25:33,562 --> 00:25:35,217
No, because,

496
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:36,733
guess what.

497
00:25:36,864 --> 00:25:37,994
I don't read minds.

498
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:41,827
You okay?

499
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:51,018
He had a G.I infarction
caused by a clot

500
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:52,842
in his superior mesenteric artery.

501
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,580
We had to remove a foot of bowel.

502
00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:57,054
If more clots keep forming,
he may not last 24 hours.

503
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,056
And the moron still won't talk.

504
00:25:59,315 --> 00:26:01,267
Bad guy, cool; good guy, moron?

505
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,557
- Pretty much.
- Guy's a hero.

506
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:06,188
He's risking his life
to put these dealers in jail.

507
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:09,066
I'm sure the dealers who take
their places will be very grateful.

508
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:12,359
So vertigo, fever, and thrombosis.

509
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,519
We've already ruled out
cancer and infection.

510
00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:17,657
He got worse on steroids,
which suggests it's not autoimmune.

511
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:20,866
- So we're stuck with environmental.
- But what kind of environmentals?

512
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:23,090
Toxins, parasites, allergens.

513
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,792
We should pick the top ten possibilities
and treat them.

514
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,544
Except that treating for everything
could kill him faster than whatever.

515
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,296
Got a better idea?

516
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,014
Sort of.
Chase is right.

517
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:34,926
Our patient is holding out
for noble reasons: protecting his bust.

518
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,575
Anybody else on that crew got sick,

519
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,971
I'm guessing
they'd be a little more self-serving.

520
00:26:44,162 --> 00:26:45,162
Thanks.

521
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:50,232
Surgery went well.
You'll be able to see him soon.

522
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,864
Used to be all about
ferberizing your kid.

523
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,812
Now they're saying
it could mess them up.

524
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,297
My... Mine's 6 and a half.

525
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:06,675
Mickey's getting worse.

526
00:27:07,615 --> 00:27:09,163
The clot is a very bad sign.

527
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:11,462
We really need you
to tell us where he's been.

528
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:13,871
I do that...

529
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,427
There's a very good chance that I could
end up John Doe at the county M.E.

530
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,263
Look, Mickey got sick
because he had the most exposure.

531
00:27:21,615 --> 00:27:24,016
Other guys are at risk too.
You don't want to...

532
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:26,285
You okay?

533
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:30,681
- I feel dizzy.
- Are you diabetic?

534
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,860
When was the last time
you were at your office?

535
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,321
- Did you drug me?
- What?

536
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,406
You're trying to make me think
that I'm sick

537
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,994
so I'll take you to the stash.

538
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,859
Of course not,
but if you are sick...

539
00:27:43,984 --> 00:27:45,579
No, I don't feel sick.

540
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:46,806
I feel drugged!

541
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,749
Trust me, I know the difference.

542
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:55,426
You didn't even drink half of it.
You'll be fine in an hour.

543
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,732
You think Mickey could die?

544
00:28:03,124 --> 00:28:04,474
It's just a deal.

545
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:07,687
I'll take you.

546
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:16,700
Couldn't have given us a heads up
that he was living in a drycleaner?

547
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,536
It's like living in a vat of poison.

548
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:20,565
Is that it?
Can we get out of here?

549
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,918
- I gotta cover all our bases.
- Okay, fine. Look...

550
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:24,298
Back there.

551
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:25,536
Hurry up.

552
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,013
What are these, more chemicals?

553
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:43,608
Not exactly.

554
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,184
If this stuff was the problem,
there'd be a lot more sick people.

555
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:53,815
Did you call the cops?

556
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,401
No one's supposed to be here.

557
00:28:58,964 --> 00:28:59,862
Come here.

558
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:01,901
I said no kissing!

559
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,186
I didn't know you'd be here.

560
00:29:06,357 --> 00:29:09,573
The deal was just for you. This guy
wants to watch, it's an extra 50.

561
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:12,803
Yeah, private party, man.

562
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:14,501
I got it covered tonight.

563
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:29,468
Nice.

564
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:33,040
The jealousy is...

565
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:34,873
killing me.

566
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:39,276
He clearly cares about you.
Very much.

567
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,473
Why can't he show it in a...
In a normal way?

568
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:45,064
I'm so tired of...

569
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:47,951
the whole silence
and the resentment.

570
00:29:49,085 --> 00:29:51,080
I don't know
if I can go back there tonight.

571
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:55,584
I need some time.

572
00:29:57,957 --> 00:29:59,704
Come stay at my place.

573
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,007
Really?

574
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:05,064
It'll be fun.

575
00:30:05,435 --> 00:30:07,680
You know, like a...
Like a sleepover.

576
00:30:08,996 --> 00:30:10,891
That would...
That would be...

577
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:14,154
It would be such a help.
Thank you.

578
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:20,943
What are you doing here?

579
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:22,788
I'm here because...

580
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,324
Nothing you can say
is going to change anything.

581
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:37,626
I love this man.

582
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:42,405
And I am not wasting
another moment of my life

583
00:30:43,097 --> 00:30:44,247
denying that.

584
00:30:51,962 --> 00:30:53,183
Will you marry me?

585
00:30:56,363 --> 00:30:57,604
This is unexpected.

586
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,569
Say yes!

587
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,825
I'm gonna go.

588
00:31:10,962 --> 00:31:14,496
You two obviously
have some talking to do.

589
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:16,099
Excuse me.

590
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:32,959
- How's it coming?
- So far, nothing.

591
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:35,017
Carpet, paint, insulation.

592
00:31:35,264 --> 00:31:37,907
Even the gross food in the fridge.
Everything's coming up clean.

593
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:41,148
Which leaves the dry-cleaning chemicals.
Should've the results in a few minutes.

594
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,178
Foreman's already started him
on inhaled albuterol.

595
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:46,320
Chances are, this case is over.

596
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,873
- We have to tell him.
- We can't.

597
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:50,850
Won't change the fact
that Cuddy let him walk.

598
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,727
It'll just let him know
it was all because of a stupid prank.

599
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:56,361
We have to tell Cuddy.

600
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:58,373
We confess and beg her
to take him back.

601
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,210
If it worked, he would have a raise,
and we wouldn't be screwed.

602
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,880
Albuterol is not helping.
Patient started coughing blood.

603
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,885
What about adding ipratropium?

604
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,550
- That might...
- Don't bother.

605
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:11,428
We assumed this place
was using perchloroethylene.

606
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:14,306
Turns out...
Petroleum solvents.

607
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:16,975
The drug dealers are running
a green drycleaner?

608
00:32:17,995 --> 00:32:19,524
I hate to push past the irony,

609
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:22,356
but our patient's bleeding
into his lungs, and we've got nothing.

610
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,384
The v/q scan last night
showed a pulmonary aneurysm.

611
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:29,863
Explains the coughing blood.

612
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,289
I did an embolization
to stop the bleeding,

613
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:34,159
then started up again this morning.

614
00:32:34,846 --> 00:32:37,609
- Three more aneurysms.
- Those look like mycotic aneurysms.

615
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:39,081
Indicates a fungal infection.

616
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,059
That'd be consistent with his other
symptoms: the vertigo, the fever.

617
00:32:42,184 --> 00:32:44,605
I didn't see any fungus at the location,
and none of the...

618
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,638
Somebody missed something.

619
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:48,964
Which is embarrassing for somebody.

620
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,884
And the steroids we gave him

621
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,894
would have suppressed
his immune system.

622
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:55,542
If that was a fungus,
he'd have 30 aneurysms.

623
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:58,358
Somebody's got a good point.

624
00:32:58,483 --> 00:33:02,146
One bleed to four in less than 12 hours?
That seems like an uptick to me.

625
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:06,150
We need to start him on antifungal meds
before he drowns in his own blood.

626
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:10,259
Do it.

627
00:33:12,263 --> 00:33:14,266
How long till it starts working?

628
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,376
Give it a few hours.
We'll be back to check on you.

629
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:37,639
There you go.

630
00:33:38,228 --> 00:33:39,378
Take it easy.

631
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,483
You shouldn't have taken her there,
you imbecile.

632
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:50,341
They found nothing.

633
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:54,436
You could have got
your brains blown out.

634
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:56,335
I had to do something.

635
00:33:56,697 --> 00:33:59,047
I couldn't just sit and watch and...

636
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:07,223
You're my friend.

637
00:34:10,012 --> 00:34:11,012
Thanks.

638
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:15,573
You'd do it for me.

639
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:21,688
I should get going.

640
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:24,394
Got the big man from Philly
coming in tonight.

641
00:34:31,386 --> 00:34:33,237
You want me to stay, I'll stay.

642
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:36,228
Jimmy knows everything that we know.

643
00:34:40,242 --> 00:34:42,492
The six months we put in on this...

644
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:47,139
You gotta be there.

645
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,467
I'll swing by tomorrow.

646
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:03,642
I'm sorry.

647
00:35:05,885 --> 00:35:08,285
You know that...
I can't go with you.

648
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,751
It was all our fault.

649
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:25,372
We were screwing with Foreman,

650
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:28,490
trying to make him think
he made less than we did.

651
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,003
Obviously,
things got out of control.

652
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:34,562
Well, someone does something
stupid and insensitive,

653
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,687
I always figure it was House.

654
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:39,177
Good to know it's catching.

655
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,097
Look, there is no other job.
He was just trying to get a raise.

656
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,825
Even if you gave him
a little more money, I know he'd stay.

657
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,775
I'm not giving Foreman a raise

658
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,271
because the three of you
decided to amuse yourselves.

659
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:52,941
We know, and that's why we want you
to take it out of our paychecks.

660
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:55,777
You two okay with this?

661
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:01,058
- Is there any other option?
- We're okay with it.

662
00:36:01,435 --> 00:36:03,285
Foreman is a good team leader.

663
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:05,536
He deserves it.

664
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:07,313
Okay, then.

665
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:09,743
That is what I will do.

666
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:12,985
And just so you know...

667
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:17,340
I've no idea what you're talking about.
I haven't seen Foreman in three days.

668
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:34,206
The phrase "Who's your daddy?"
comes to mind.

669
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,495
Want to grab some coffee?

670
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:49,915
Kind of a bad time.

671
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:53,460
Sorry.
You told me to drop by, so...

672
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,652
- This is when I could make it.
- Right.

673
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,172
Come in.

674
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:06,227
This whole thing with Wilson...

675
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:08,433
It's all my fault.

676
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:11,520
We're not closeted,
because we're not gay.

677
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:13,814
For real.

678
00:37:14,794 --> 00:37:18,103
Wilson thought you were cute,
and I was just yanking his chain.

679
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:21,363
Maybe that's not the best phrasing.

680
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,370
So you were only spending time with me
to screw with him?

681
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:28,495
God, no. I was spending time with you
because I want to touch your boobs.

682
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:30,996
Enough to listen to <i>Evita,</i> twice.

683
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:33,375
I really hate <i>Evita.</i>
That's how much I like your boobs.

684
00:37:39,244 --> 00:37:40,963
Wait. Wait, wait.

685
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:46,583
He's a really good guy.

686
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,900
And he really likes you.

687
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:54,001
Well, it's really...

688
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:56,772
It's sweet of you to stick up
for your friend like that.

689
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:02,969
And you're still
trying to sleep with me.

690
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,491
You know, maybe I will call him.
It would serve you right.

691
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:08,542
Wilson's a jerk too.

692
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:10,977
At least he tried
to do the right thing.

693
00:38:11,102 --> 00:38:14,624
He's been divorced three times.
He slept with a dying patient.

694
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,255
Sure, he looks like a boy scout,
but then...

695
00:38:37,628 --> 00:38:40,108
The aneurysms look mycotic,
but they're not.

696
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:42,389
They're inflammatory.

697
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,775
Because this is not
a fungal infection.

698
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:47,346
The hypertension was a real symptom.

699
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:49,596
You've been unwittingly treating it
with beta blockers.

700
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:52,391
You stopped taking them,
and your blood pressure went up.

701
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,832
It's Hughes-Stovin.

702
00:38:58,373 --> 00:39:00,295
Okay, so how...
How do we treat this?

703
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:07,844
We don't.

704
00:39:08,643 --> 00:39:10,764
Hughes-Stovin
is an autoimmune disease.

705
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:13,642
Once it's this advanced,
there's not much we can do.

706
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:17,461
The aneurysms keep multiplying.
Eventually...

707
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:20,065
One of them will rupture.

708
00:39:22,748 --> 00:39:23,985
Are you sure?

709
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:27,697
If you die in the next day or so,
I will be.

710
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,234
Even if you had told us
everything we wanted to know,

711
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,303
it wouldn't have made a difference.

712
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:39,713
You did the right thing.

713
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:47,621
I think I should call my wife now.

714
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:45,582
I'm sorry about your patient.

715
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,300
He died a hero in his own mind.

716
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,800
Guess it's better than nothing.

717
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:54,157
Ran into Nora in the elevator.

718
00:41:54,282 --> 00:41:56,172
She no longer thinks we're gay.

719
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:58,432
Now she thinks
we're mendacious dirt bags.

720
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:02,995
Mendacious dirt bag
comes much more naturally to me.

721
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:05,814
Least we can get rid of that.

722
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:08,146
I kind of like it.

723
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,210
Unlike this sofa.

724
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:11,719
It's 500 bucks.

725
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,613
And...

726
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:15,307
It reclines.

727
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,168
I will punch you in the face.

728
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:27,962
I'll stop, if you
get rid of the sofa.

729
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:30,338
No chance.
