1
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,307
Are you ever coming to bed?

2
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:50,551
I still say I'm a vegetarian.

3
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,804
You can say that you're an astronaut,
but that doesn't make it true.

4
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,033
A salmon is not a vegetable,
Frankie.

5
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:58,475
Apparently, eight out of ten commenters
agree with you.

6
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:02,061
Except for the part where you said,
"I believe what I want to believe".

7
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:05,379
- That they found a little judgmental.
- You blogged our argument?

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,435
I asked you
to quit talking about me.

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,701
I don't want a bunch of people
that I don't know

10
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:12,865
hearing stuff
that's meant to be between me and you.

11
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:14,634
I write about my life.

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,565
- And you're a big part of that.
- I want to be a big part of your life.

13
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,748
But I don't want to be
a big part of their lives.

14
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:23,443
Take it down, erase it, delete it.

15
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:24,928
Make it go away.

16
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,096
It's 2:00 in the morning.
The walls are made out of tissue paper.

17
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:38,474
I gotta be up in 3 hours
to do a wiring job in Edison.

18
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:40,744
I'm sorry.
We'll try to hold it down.

19
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:41,869
Sorry.

20
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,563
Frankie, what happened?

21
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:49,084
Something's wrong.

22
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,695
We need a police car
at 152 Haverhill.

23
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:53,852
What are you two talking about?

24
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:56,158
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,539
- Are you all right?
- I think it's coming from my gums.

30
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,271
{\pos(192,230)}I'd invite you,
but people are already talking.

31
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:52,896
{\pos(192,230)}It's pathetic. You divide your nights
between porn and the Discovery Channel.

32
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:56,274
{\pos(192,220)}Right. Playing Dance Dance Revolution
is a much better choice.

33
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:58,400
{\pos(192,230)}That was a gift from a patient,

34
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,825
{\pos(192,230)}and it happens to be great exercise.

35
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:05,899
{\pos(192,230)}I mean, who rents porn anymore?
Can't you get these on the Internet?

36
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:09,565
{\pos(192,230)}You can. But you can't get disc two
with the director's commentary.

37
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:12,838
{\pos(192,220)}Come out with me tonight.
I'm going speed dating.

Count me in.

{\pos(192,220)}You need to meet somebody.
This way, you meet 20 somebodies.

40
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:20,716
{\pos(192,220)}Over a five-minute discussion of Proust?
Speed dating's a meat market.

41
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:23,370
{\pos(192,220)}Yeah, dozens of women
just waiting to be hit on.

42
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:27,249
{\pos(192,220)}Your odds of a happy ending are nearly
as good as staying home, watching porn.

43
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:38,093
You plan on doing any work?

44
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:41,054
{\pos(192,220)}I thought I might do a little
light doctoring in the afternoon.

45

28-year-old female
sudden unexplained coagulopathy.

46
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:46,785
{\pos(192,220)}- Could be congenital thrombocytopenia.
- Platelets look normal.

47

{\pos(192,220)}Patient makes money
doing freelance photography.

48
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:51,597
{\pos(192,220)}Some photographic processes
produce toxic gases.

49
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,227
{\pos(192,220)}She's a blogger. I can't see her photos
being anything but digital.

50
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:57,196
{\pos(192,220)}What does she blog?
Politics? Dominatrix? Cooking?

51

{\pos(192,220)}- 'Cause I need recipes.
- It's a personal journal.

52
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,950
{\pos(192,220)}- I don't get putting your life online.
- It's not that crazy.

53
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,911
Privacy's basically
a modern invention.

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,311
{\pos(192,220)}Towns used to be too small
for anybody to keep any secrets.

55
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:10,641
{\pos(192,220)}What if it's not the platelets,
but the glue that holds 'em together?

56
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:13,003

are normal.

57
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:16,494

is exactly why people leave small towns

58
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:17,810
{\pos(192,220)}and move to the city.

59
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:20,789
{\pos(192,220)}And a lot of people choose to stay
because, in return for zero privacy,

60
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:22,892
{\pos(192,220)}you get community, connection.

61
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:24,817
{\pos(192,220)}Big red as for our tunics.

we have over 300 cable channels.

64
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,487

she couldn't have been exposed

65
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:34,905
{\pos(192,220)}to some other toxin.
We should search the apartment.

66
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,430
{\pos(192,220)}Eeny, meeny, miny,
Thirteen and tiny.

67
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,243
This one's locked.

68
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,846
{\pos(192,220)}I'm surprised you took
the pro-community position.

69
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,053
{\pos(192,220)}I have friends. I like people.

70
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:52,778
{\pos(192,220)}You also like secrets.

71
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:56,588
You deny it,
it sort of proves my point.

72
00:04:57,115 --> 00:04:59,883
{\pos(192,220)}When we're left to our own devices,
we make lousy choices.

73
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:05,653
Ignore it.

74
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:07,491
I can hear you in there.

75
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:10,061
Open the door,
or I'm calling the cops.

76
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,771
We're 4 stories up,
but there's a fire escape over there.

77
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,797
The ledge might be wide enough.

78
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:18,931
{\pos(192,220)}We're doctors.
We aren't stealing anything.

79
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:20,806
We're collecting samples.

80
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,283
- Who are you?
- The neighbor.

81
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:26,658
Did they say
that you could come in here and...

82
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,537
- What do you know about them?
- Not much.

83
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,164
The guy works a lot.
I see Frankie around.

84
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,095
We argue a few times a week,
and then we go back about our business.

85
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,378
- Why?
- Frankie's got some strong opinions.

86
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:38,964
Wants to recycle
every molecule of trash.

87
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,425
You take
the anti-recycling position?

88
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:44,874
Trash piling up for composting's
attracting the rats.

89
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:46,749
I had to put down poison.

90
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,725
- It's her private drawer.
- She said she doesn't have any secrets.

91
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:51,268
I'm taking her at her word.

92
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,050
Is there any chance
Frankie touched the rat poison?

93
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:57,900
She grabbed a chunk of it
right out of the mouth of the schnauzer.

94
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:01,486
Now every time I put the stuff down,
she picks it back up.

95
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:29,889
- You brought a date?
- He seemed to think it was a good idea.

96
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,893
- You need to dive back into the pool.
- And he has to swim in ours?

97
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:35,571
You go to a bar,
you bring your ugly friends.

98
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,364
It's not a beauty pageant.

99
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,358
Life is a beauty pageant.

100
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:42,319
Little girls who kiss frogs
expect them to turn into you.

101
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:43,490
Come on.

102
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:45,697
- I'm not that good-looking.
- Yeah, you are.

103
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:48,700
You kind of are.

104
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:51,136
So you attribute every relationship

105
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:53,452
I've ever had to the height
of my cheekbones?

106
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:54,957
Just the beginning.

107
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,125
- The rest is your hair.
- This is ridiculous.

108
00:06:57,294 --> 00:07:00,138
Women aren't as distracted
by appearances as we are.

109
00:07:00,263 --> 00:07:01,421
They look deeper.

110
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,216
You wanna bet?

111
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:07,829
You can't tell anyone you're a doctor.
You're unemployed.

112
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:10,597
You're also a little slow,
misunderstanding everything they say.

113
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:12,454
And lose the accent.

114
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:16,179
A hundred bucks says you still
walk out of here with a dozen names.

115
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,773
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fun is about to start.

116
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,624
When I strike this gong,
each man should sit at the table

117
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:23,957
you've been assigned.

118
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,460
When I strike it again, date's over,

119
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:27,585
move on.

120
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:32,202
I'm an oncologist.

121
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:35,689
My aunt and my grandma,
they both died from breast cancer.

122
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:38,792
Do you wanna talk about it?

123
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:42,123
I'm a diagnostician.

124
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:46,508
I find out what's wrong with people,
and I fix it.

125
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,477
Don't all doctors do that?

126
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,290
Yeah, but they can't dance
like I can.

127
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:57,769
- I play video games.
- Professionally?

128
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,690
I wish, bro.

129
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:06,241
After six months of chemo,
we thought he was out of the woods.

130
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,490
- I don't want kids.
- Check.

131
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,742
I'm thinking about going
from a "C" to a "D".

132
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:13,951
Quadruple check.

133
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,038
And I'm on fire for the lord.

134
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,622
- I'm a chocolatier.
- I could tell by your hips.

135
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:24,337
Yeah, I guess I could afford
to lose a few pounds.

136
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,283
I don't think I know anybody
who died of cancer.

137
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,408
Thank God.

138
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,263
For you, I mean.
Obviously.

139
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,630
Except my cat.

140
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,274
She died a few months ago.

141
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:40,350
- I hate these things.
- What, are you here at gunpoint?

142
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:42,076
You need me to call 911?

143
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:43,440
Friend dragged me.

144
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,859
She keeps trying to fix my life.

145
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,778
Which, admittedly,
could use it, but...

146
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,422
still annoying.

147
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,014
You like puzzles.

148
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:55,994
I hoped my job would let me
play with puzzles all day long,

149
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,871
but it didn't work out that way.

150
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,580
Police detective.

151
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,402
Turns out criminals are idiots.

152
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:03,667
If they're not gonna bother
to challenge you,

153
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,142
what's the point?

154
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:10,550
Is there a fire alarm we could pull?

155
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,318
Maybe get out of here.

156
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:15,234
Except...

157
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:18,170
maybe you're just too "swoft".

158
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:21,852
- Beg your pardon.
- Swoft.

159
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,771
It's one of your crossword answers.

160
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,798
I believe it means lying manipulator

161
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,818
who tells men
anything they want to hear.

162
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:30,112
You brought a prop
as a conversation starter.

163
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,774
Folded the paper to make it look read,
filled in some answers,

164
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,659
you couldn't be bothered to work at it,
so you just put in random letters.

165
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:38,498
You have some natural talent
as a liar,

166
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,454
but not enough brains
to see it through.

167
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:42,414
I'm gonna assume you're not a cop.

168
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,666
Are the five minutes up?

169
00:09:55,114 --> 00:09:57,764
These women would welcome
a call from you.

170
00:09:58,151 --> 00:10:01,001
And these women would
welcome a call from you.

171
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:06,736
My.

172
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,373
It's nice to have visitors.

173
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:22,142
- I'm updating my blog.
- And I'm reading it.

174
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,922
You realize you're in the same room?

175
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:28,295
Sorry.

176
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,131
I've been thinking.

177
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,000
And I'm sure I washed my hands
after I threw out the rat poison.

178
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,628
Apparently you did it multiple times
over a course of days.

179
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:39,514
- Can't be too certain.
- You must be Dr. Foreman.

180
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:43,399
Got to get back to work.
Take it easy.

181
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,314
What? She reads my blog.

182
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,694
I don't think
you're condescending at all.

183
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,194
That's not what I wrote.

184
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,449
When you were taking my history,
I told you I went whitewater rafting,

185
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,538
and you said,
"it was unlikely to be related".

186
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,661
I was just giving information.
Let's face it. You got a little snarky.

187
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:05,624
- You can't convey a tone in writing.
- I just put what you said.

188
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,594
If you don't want people
to think that,

189
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,711
maybe you shouldn't say
condescending things.

190
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,198
Can this wait a second?
'Cause I have to pee.

191
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,847
I think people behave badly
because there are no records

192
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:22,349
of what we say or do.

193
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:24,965
And nobody believes anymore
that God's watching.

194
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,505
God's not, but I am.

195
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,930
Everything is on the record,
including everything I do.

196
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,319
I don't think my pee
is supposed to be mud-colored.

197
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,158
We were wrong about the rat poison.

198
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:48,332
Coagulopathy plus kidney
equals what?

199
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,053
Hemolytic uremic syndrome.

200
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:54,840
- Normal creatinine levels.
- She has elevated cholesterol.

201
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:57,671
Can't find my pornos.

202
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:01,930
- Have you tried offering a reward?
- Gaucher's disease.

203
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:04,587
It would affect her ability
to synthesize vitamin K.

204
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,561
She's on a semi-vegetarian diet.
She gets plenty of vitamin K.

205
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,560
Sjogren's is more likely.

206
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:13,066
You moved them while you were dusting.
I checked the drawers, windowsill,

207
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:15,001
dvd player in your room.

208
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:17,112
The quiet ones
are always deeply repressed.

209
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,637
I returned them to the store.

210
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:23,451
She had a fish dinner.
Could be haff disease causing rhabdo.

211
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,022
What? Why did you
return them to the store?

212
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:28,885
It's no trouble. I had to stop next-door
for my dry cleaning anyway.

213
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,922
Sjogren's wouldn't inhibit
the clotting enzymes,

214
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:33,086
- infiltrate the kidneys...
- So does haff disease.

215
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:35,088
I'm not thanking you.
I'm asking you why.

216
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:38,578
Because if I did happen
to bring a woman home last night,

217
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,929
I wanted it to be a porn-free zone.

218
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:47,492
You do realize things
don't have to be socks

219
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:48,935
to go into a sock drawer.

220
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,645
I'm sorry.
Horribly, horribly sorry.

221
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,296
I thought you'd...

222
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:55,071
watched them all.

223
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,322
You completely ruined my morning.

224
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,889
I had to pull out
your old family photos.

225
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,232
Your mom was pretty hot.

226
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:10,332
Haff disease fits the timing best.

227
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,042
Start her on saline and mannitol.

228
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:24,137
You reading your patient's blog?

229
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:27,199
You should.

230
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,974
Could be some clues.

231
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:32,229
Too many.
Be like doing a whole body scan.

232
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:34,273
Send us up eight blind alleys.

233
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:36,066
Chase is doing it.

234
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,150
She mentions you.

235
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:41,306
She's never met me.

236
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,955
You're an unseen presence,

237
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,618
- Like the wizard of Oz.
- He was a fraud.

238
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:48,829
She couldn't have gone
with Keyser Soze?

239
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,414
Speaking of movies
that don't make any sense,

240
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,100
I stopped at the rental store
to get those pornos back.

241
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:57,701
I told the guy I was so grateful
that you'd returned them.

242
00:13:57,826 --> 00:13:58,838
Guess what.

243
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,725
You only returned two.

244
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,081
You lost the third.

245
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:07,510
Decent of you to pay for it,
not let them put it on my bill.

246
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:08,685
You know...

247
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:12,648
- I can explain what happened.
- I'm sure you could.

248
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:15,675
But rather than listen to your lies,
I thought it'd be more fun

249
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,376
to drive all over town
and get another copy.

250
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,059
You have it here?

251
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:35,547
Oh, God!

252
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,019
Okay, first,

253
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,413
that's not me.

254
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:42,938
It's not... Mostly not...

255
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,568
I was in college.

256
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:48,443
My roommate was minoring in film.

257
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,807
Are you hyperventilating?

258
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,600
Remember that covering
your mouth and one nostril can help.

259
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:55,645
He had to get this in
for some grade,

260
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:57,147
and he was desperate.

261
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,941
The only reason I did it was because
no one'd ever see it.

262
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,652
Who knew he'd become
an actual director?

263
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,277
He's not a director.

264
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:05,739
He's an artist.

265
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,950
The way he plays with light
and darkness and...

266
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:10,723
Boobs.

267
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,490
Look! That's not me.

268
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,246
<i>What are you?
Where are you taking me?</i>

269
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:16,927
<i>Be not afraid.</i>

270
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:19,919
<i>The forest nymphs have taught me
how to please a woman.</i>

271
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,609
That's not me!
I mean, you can see it's not me.

272
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,242
He added extra scenes

273
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:30,972
so he could release it as a porno.

274
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:32,978
Be not afraid, Wilson.

275
00:15:33,103 --> 00:15:35,003
You took risks for your art.

276
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:41,923
No one...

277
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,230
Look at me.

278
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,397
No one can know about this.

279
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:49,688
From this moment on,
my lips are sealed.

280
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:57,943
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

281
00:15:58,434 --> 00:15:59,634
Be not afraid.

282
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,154
Find anything?

283
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,401
Relevant? No.

284
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:11,096
Interesting. I guess.

285
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:12,751
There's nothing she doesn't share.

286
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:14,391
"Angry sex is overrated.

287
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,248
"How can he expect me to be aroused
when I'm so pissed at him?"

288
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:19,479
That might earn her a new kidney.

289
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,898
An hour after she blogged
about her kidney failure,

290
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,442
the hospital got a call
from Singapore.

291
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,027
One reader
asking how hard it would be to donate.

292
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:32,849
How good-looking am I?

293
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:37,694
I'm not asking
if you're attracted to me.

294
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:39,583
I'm looking for an objective answer.

295
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:41,668
Then it's an appropriate question.

296
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,954
Last night,
I acted like a complete tosser

297
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,631
to prove to House
women don't go out with me for my looks

298
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,342
Cost me a hundred bucks
and my definition of myself.

299
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:51,052
- And women.
- Date men.

300
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,637
They're not shallow at all.

301
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,765
- Everything's physical.
- We are physical beings.

302
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,333
Some more than others.

303
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,145
Please don't define my entire gender
based on one night.

304
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:03,813
What if the patient's problem
is physical, not emotional?

305
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,343
What if her lack of arousal
had nothing to do with their fight?

306
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,946
Sjogren's would inhibit
her normal secretions.

307
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,800
Sorry for keeping you up.

308
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:17,851
I thought it better
not to wait till morning.

309
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:19,026
No problem.

310
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,600
I'm a night owl.

311
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:25,742
So you think I might have
this Sjogren's

312
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:27,594
'cause of my lack of discharge?

313
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:30,675
It's lucky you wrote about that.

314
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:33,219
A little crazy, you're thinking,
to share that much?

315
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,387
Not crazy.

316
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,712
Unusual to be so intimate
with people you don't know.

317
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:39,225
But I do know them.

318
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,102
They read my blog,
I comment on theirs.

319
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,430
Cause you haven't met someone physically
doesn't mean you don't know them.

320
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:46,355
Are you in a relationship?

321
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,712
- It recently ended.
- I'm sorry.

322
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,037
Lie flat on your back all the way.

323
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:59,029
You saw each other every day, right?

324
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:01,031
Did you tell her
about what you were thinking?

325
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:03,987
Or did you just talk
about where you were going to dinner

326
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:06,262
and who needed to do the laundry?

327
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,131
Is that what your relationship
with Taylor is like?

328
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:13,159
Maybe a little.

329
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,304
You know, he's great,
but sometimes it's easier

330
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:18,778
to open up to people
who aren't looking at you.

331
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:22,169
Lie flat for the X-ray.

332
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:24,270
I'm not comfortable on my back.

333
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,461
- Can't we do it this way?
- Did you strain a muscle?

334
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:31,423
What's wrong?

335
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:39,924
I've booked her in
for heart surgery.

336
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,412
I was doing a sialogram

337
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,298
and she didn't wanna lie
on her back.

338
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,876
That's a complaint you hear from people
with heart valve issues, it fits.

339
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,547
Sjogren's damaged her heart,
causing clotting and kidney problems.

340
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:53,466
You based all that on the fact
that she didn't want to lie down?

341
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:57,887
That, and the cardiac echo I performed
after she didn't want to lie down.

342
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,308
Her mitral valve is nearly gone.

343
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,476
Which means she's nearly gone.

344
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,304
God, you're pretty.

345
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:17,780
We can replace the mitral valve
with a pig valve or with a plastic one.

346
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:20,084
From an actual pig?

347
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:23,496
It's the better choice
if you want to have children someday.

348
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:26,184
A plastic valve requires you
to be on anticoagulants,

349
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:27,667
which cause birth defects.

350
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:31,379
On the other hand,
the pig valve wears out quickly,

351
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,090
so you'd need another heart surgery
in ten years.

352
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:36,514
I know you're on the fence
about having kids,

353
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:38,219
but Taylor really wants them.

354
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:41,848
It's in the blog.

355
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,143
You will need to agree on that decision
earlier than planned.

356
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:55,991
It's your call.

357
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,616
Can you pass me my laptop?

358
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:03,558
- Seriously?
- I want some feedback.

359
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,786
You really think
that asking strangers

360
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:09,000
for some off-the-top-of-their-head
response is gonna be helpful here?

361
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,128
A lot of your readers
are into animal rights.

362
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,212
They've got you 2/3 of the way
to vegan.

363
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,350
What are they gonna say about you
buying your life with thatof a pig?

364
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:18,341
Whatever they say,
I don't have to do it.

365
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:21,924
It won't work out that way,
And we're gonna have to live with this.

366
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,640
Please, Frankie.

367
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:26,406
Don't tell them.

368
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:31,689
If I start picking and choosing,
I'm being dishonest.

369
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:33,675
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:08,684
Though I should thank whoever taught you
how to please a woman.

371
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,329
Maybe it was the forest nymphs.

372
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,199
Get my <i>Vertigo</i> poster back.

373
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,647
Be not afraid, it's exact change.

374
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:43,684
I'm looking to get something
on House.

375
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:47,223
Couldn't you just ask the love nymphs
for the secret?

376
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,511
Don't!
My mission is to find something

377
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:54,136
House would not like to see made public
and make it public.

378
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:56,887
In.

379
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,069
You know him better than anyone,
why do you need me?

380
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,113
He'd leave nothing secret
around the condo.

381
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,990
You've worked in the same office.

382
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,758
On and off, for years.

383
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:07,502
Think back.

384
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,162
Any odd phone calls

385
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,753
or visitors from the past?

386
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:12,915
He brings prostitutes
into the hospital,

387
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,130
and he gambles with bookies
'cause he's too lazy to go to the OTB.

388
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:17,955
And you're asking for...

389
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,053
He's reading <i>The Golden Bowl</i>.

390
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,112
By Henry Kames?

391
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,533
He's not really reading it.

392
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:33,895
I don't understand.

393
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:37,899
That book's at least 400 pages long.
What he's reading is half that thick.

394
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:41,327
Maybe he's reading a version
with a smaller font.

395
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,071
He's not using his glasses.

396
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:46,073
Good point.

397
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:48,034
He took the cover off

398
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:51,756
and put it onto this other book
so no one'd know what he was reading.

399
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:54,131
Whatever it is, he's ashamed of it.

400
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,239
I'm going with plastic.

401
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:07,345
It just makes more sense.

402
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:09,514
I don't want another operation
later.

403
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:11,349
That's not why you're doing this.

404
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:17,438
When you were first telling me about
why you love the Internet, you said

405
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,398
that no one has to be alone again.

406
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,816
Whoever you are, whatever you love,

407
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,215
you can connect with someone.

408
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,666
If you want to recreate
the Boston tea party

409
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,060
while dressed
as imperial storm troopers,

410
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:32,161
you can find ten people in the world
that have always wanted to do that.

411
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,814
That hasn't changed.

412
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,373
But you have.

413
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,168
This thing that you do,
it's not about connection anymore.

414
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,979
It's about an audience.
It's a performance,

415
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,401
and you've got one eye
on the number of hits.

416
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:47,721
You've turned our lives
into their entertainment.

417
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,390
You're smart, you're fun to read,
it's okay.

418
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,062
But don't give them this.

419
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,375
Or if you do, don't...

420
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:06,831
Expect me to be here.

421
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,164
It's a good cover choice,
it's not like anyone would pick it up.

422
00:24:17,493 --> 00:24:19,208
It's Cameron's favorite book.

423
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:23,296
- I don't even know what it's about.
- Don't do that to yourself.

424
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:25,840
What the hell?

425
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:34,342
Giving him a computer
is like giving plutonium to Dr. No.

426
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:36,205
Got it.

427
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,851
<i>Step by step:
Sermons for everyday life?</i>

428
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,243
These are literal sermons,
written by a minister.

429
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:56,495
Loving thy neighbor even when hisstereo
is keeping you up at night.

430
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:59,298
- Why would he read this?
- Why would he hide it?

431
00:24:59,423 --> 00:25:01,428
He reads the Bible,
he reads the Koran,

432
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:04,124
he says he likes to know
what mistakes people are making.

433
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:06,255
You think he's sincere?

434
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,132
That he's getting something
out of this?

435
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:09,624
I don't know.

436
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,069
What a hypocrite.

437
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:16,361
How can we use this
in a cruel yet funny way?

438
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,521
You know what?

439
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,012
Don't mention this to anyone.

440
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:26,429
What was the point?

441
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,410
Are you gonna be here
when I wake up?

442
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,530
I hate that you don't have a blog.

443
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:47,231
I hate that I don't know
what you're thinking.

444
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:50,812
Let's not get into it right now.

445
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:53,622
We need to get you through surgery.

446
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,430
I don't wanna go in there
knowing that you'll stick with me

447
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,435
'cause that's what good guys do,

448
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:03,312
- But once I'm better, you'll be gone.
- Let's not get into it now.

449
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,565
It hurts.

450
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:09,110
- Is it her heart?
- No, it's here.

451
00:26:14,035 --> 00:26:15,700
Get her inside.

452
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:27,919
Your appendix burst,
we had to remove it.

453
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,244
And the biopsy confirms
it was full of abnormal cells

454
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,174
consistent with lymphoma.

455
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:38,914
I have cancer?

456
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:41,935
We've postponed
putting in the new valve.

457
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,603
I guess we do chemo
and all that stuff?

458
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:47,732
Apparently you've had this
for some time.

459
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,568
When your appendix burst,
it was like a dam giving way.

460
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,904
The cells went streaming
throughout your body.

461
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,907
So you'll treat,
but you don't expect it to work.

462
00:26:56,516 --> 00:26:57,909
That's why no valve.

463
00:26:58,229 --> 00:26:59,479
It's pointless.

464
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:02,830
Our dean of medicine
has approved an experimental treatment.

465
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,458
We use your unique
cancer cell signature

466
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,774
to create a targeted
lymphoma vaccine.

467
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:10,239
Okay, so that'll cure me?

468
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:13,424
Well, we're not actually sure
what it'll do,

469
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,880
but the intention
is to train your immune system

470
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:18,974
to recognize and kill cells
bearing the same malignant signature

471
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,076
while leaving healthy cells alone.

472
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,230
But, as Dr. Foreman says,

473
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,784
it's experimental.

474
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:25,909
I see.

475
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:27,981
Without it,
what time are we talking about?

476
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:31,169
- An exact prognosis is impossible.
- How about a guess?

477
00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:32,694
Something, please.

478
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:37,349
Based on people
in situations like yours...

479
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,820
Maybe a year.

480
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:43,954
Baby,

481
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:46,524
whatever we have to do, we'll do.

482
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,334
I can take care of you.

483
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,052
I can work from home.

484
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:54,406
Sounds good.

485
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,981
Thank you for letting me know.

486
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:00,388
We'll start with the treatment
whenever it's ready.

487
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:10,024
Is she being a good soldier,
or is she in denial?

488
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:12,277
Denial's not unusual
for a first reaction.

489
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:15,923
Or it could be a symptom.
Some lymphomas affect cognition.

490
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:17,990
If it is denial,
she needs time to process.

491
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:21,325
If it's a symptom, hopefully treatment
with the vaccine will help.

492
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:32,535
Can I borrow your car?

493
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:38,760
She gave me the keys.

494
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,866
You're a doctor.
She was doing you a favor.

495
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:42,902
She barely knows me.

496
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:46,948
I've been deluding myself that
I'm actually connecting with people.

497
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:55,189
The first person I fell in love with
turned out to be a total tool.

498
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:58,403
I mean, he came across
all funny and charming

499
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,198
and thoughtful, but it was an act.

500
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,367
He saw something he wanted, and he knew
he had to behave a way to get it.

501
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:07,497
In retrospect, the fact
that I was 17 and he was 30

502
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:09,075
should have been a clue.

503
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:11,867
Figuring out who people are
takes time.

504
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:15,873
It takes twice as much time
if they're trying to impress you.

505
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:18,833
Now I could take from this
that anyone who loans me their car

506
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,936
has an ulterior motive, or...

507
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:24,095
I can accept
that it's just a nice thing to do

508
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,760
and take people as they come.

509
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:32,031
You wanna do the first injection?

510
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,998
Why are you reading a book
by a unitarian minister?

511
00:29:51,842 --> 00:29:52,876
Book club.

512
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,877
- Oprah was going on...
- I'm serious.

513
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:56,879
This... This is messed up.

514
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,272
Patient wrote it.

515
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:01,471
You've never treated
a patient with this name.

516
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:02,677
I looked it up.

517
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:06,931
It's an assignment
from my therapist.

518
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,208
No, it wasn't.

519
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:09,851
No one you respect

520
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,120
would give you this
and expect it to be helpful.

521
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:14,647
- It's a book!
- Of sermons.

522
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,607
For anyone else,
spiritually enlightening.

523
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:19,765
For you, it's practically
a psychotic break.

524
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,166
I know that you have trouble
sometimes with the pain

525
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,370
without the vicodin. Is that it?

526
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,543
Are you so out of options,

527
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:36,419
you're looking for answers
in what you consider irrationality?

528
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:38,838
I'm all right. Trust me.

529
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:44,093
Are you all right
because you're back on vicodin?

530
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:47,137
I said, "trust me".

531
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:50,516
I know this means something.

532
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,116
Do you mind?

533
00:30:52,662 --> 00:30:54,155
I haven't finished it yet.

534
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:13,596
Thanks for the gift.

535
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:16,615
Obviously differs
from my own personal beliefs,

536
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,088
but if these stories have helped you
through some spiritual turmoil...

537
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:24,256
Read chapter six,
entitled "shut the hell up".

538
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:27,470
I appreciated the inscription
about the benefits of prayer

539
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:29,806
before medical treatments.
I think it's great

540
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:31,724
you've been called
to witness by the Lord.

541
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,592
Chapter two, "bite me".

542
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:42,482
Thirteen's giving our patient
her third vaccine injection.

543
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:45,310
- She's responding well so far.
- Where'd you get all these copies?

544
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:47,198
- It's out of print.
- I called the author.

545
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,545
He's got cartons of the thing
in his basement.

546
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,577
You called him?
What'd you say?

547
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,493
That I knew some people who could
benefit spiritually from the book.

548
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:56,192
Did you mention me?

549
00:32:01,568 --> 00:32:02,670
Fever's at 104.

550
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,922
The antibodies tripped
her autoimmune response.

551
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:06,748
The vaccine is killing her.

552
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:15,253
Well, clearly it's not working.
You have to stop the vaccine.

553
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,229
Sure. Give up.
Let her die on schedule.

554
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:20,453
It's better than speeding up
the schedule.

555
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:21,922
How quickly did this come on?

556
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:24,771
She was all right when I woke her
this afternoon for the second injection.

557
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,617
Of the stimulating agent,
which, added to the first injection,

558
00:32:27,742 --> 00:32:29,847
switched her immune reaction
into overdrive.

559
00:32:29,972 --> 00:32:31,420
Why was she sleeping?

560
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:34,954
Who can sleep in a hospital
during the daytime?

561
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:37,749
I'm not surprised. She's tired.
She's always been a night owl.

562
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:40,282
Just by treating her,
we've disrupted her schedule.

563
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:42,160
Is that what her blog says?

564
00:32:42,285 --> 00:32:44,103
- She's a night owl?
- No, she told me.

565
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,466
In what tense? Is? Was?

566
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:47,759
Will have been?

567
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:49,761
I'm not sure.

568
00:32:50,183 --> 00:32:51,402
What are you onto?

569
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:53,437
Look at the time stamp on this post.

570
00:32:53,912 --> 00:32:56,062
2:30 a.m.
Here's one at 4:00 a.m.

571
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,123
Whatever he's onto
doesn't change the fact

572
00:32:58,248 --> 00:33:00,693
that she has lymphoma
and we gave her a dangerous vaccine.

573
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:02,319
- We need to...
- Six months ago,

574
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:04,233
she's posting in the daytime.

575
00:33:04,725 --> 00:33:06,375
Two years ago, daytime.

576
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,791
- That's her natural rhythm.
- Day-night reversal.

577
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:12,664
- Sign of liver disease?
- Which doesn't fit lymphoma.

578
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:14,285
But we know she has lymphoma.

579
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,728
We know she has the cell atypia
that indicates lymphoma.

580
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,639
Biopsy her liver.

581
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:30,023
That was pretty cool
what I did, right?

582
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,950
You wanna make out?

583
00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:38,476
You don't have lymphoma.

584
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,367
But my appendix
was full of cancer cells.

585
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:43,821
Your appendix was full of cells
that showed a lymphocytic atypia.

586
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,219
We now think they were
a granulomatous buildup

587
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:48,111
from some unknown cause.

588
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:52,144
So...

589
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:54,723
I'm not dying?

590
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:01,582
You're actually dying
more quickly than we thought.

591
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,052
Unless we figure out
what's causing your liver failure...

592
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:13,385
You have three or four days.

593
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:25,546
What the hell do you mean
I have three or four days?

594
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:30,307
Well, we're past denial.

595
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,992
Maybe we didn't cause the fever.

596
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:05,533
We gave her the vaccine,
and her fever spiked.

597
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:07,368
- Seems to me...
- But it persisted

598
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:09,622
after we took her off the vaccine.

599
00:35:09,747 --> 00:35:11,276
What if it's a new symptom?

600
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:18,665
So we add fever to cell atypia,
coagulopathy, kidney, heart, liver...

601
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,578
- It has to be an infection.
- Which one?

602
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:22,979
No one she knows is sick.
She hasn't traveled anywhere.

603
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:25,589
There's nothing in the history.
Nothing in her blog.

604
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:27,752
There has to be something unique
to this infection.

605
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,213
Something about its transmission
and the way it manifests.

606
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:32,939
There has to be something
she's not telling us.

607
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,092
There isn't.

608
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:37,896
She's told us,
and everyone else, everything.

609
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:45,489
Start her
on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

610
00:35:47,276 --> 00:35:49,024
Since we know everything,

611
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:51,693
we might as well treat
for everything.

612
00:36:52,696 --> 00:36:56,132
I picked up a copy of the book
that Chase left in the lounge.

613
00:36:58,032 --> 00:36:59,462
If you're gonna be this way,

614
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:01,439
I'm not gonna invite you
to my baptism.

615
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,089
First time I'd seen
the real dust jacket.

616
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,435
The inside back flap,
there was a picture of the author.

617
00:37:08,066 --> 00:37:10,994
Imagine how surprised I was
when I recognized him.

618
00:37:11,908 --> 00:37:14,308
Your biological father
is a minister?

619
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:19,112
Natural selection
is not an infallible force.

620
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,289
I don't get it.

621
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:27,012
Okay, he was a friend of the family.

622
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:29,037
You'd only known him
when you were a kid.

623
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:31,382
But if you wanted to meet him now,

624
00:37:31,507 --> 00:37:34,620
get an idea of what he's like,
why not just go talk to him?

625
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,175
"Hi, it's Greg.
You slept with my mother."

626
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:41,306
You're capable of it.

627
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,228
I was mildly curious.

628
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:46,414
Enough to read a book,
not make a phone call.

629
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:49,651
Please. You didn't read this.
You studied it.

630
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,687
Why?

631
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:54,072
All your life, you've thought
this was crap.

632
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,742
You can't suddenly turn around

633
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:59,861
and build a whole new worldview
based on crap.

634
00:38:01,795 --> 00:38:02,795
Crap.

635
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:09,823
You better not be faking this
just to get out of a tough conversation.

636
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:16,589
Do you poop?

637
00:38:19,772 --> 00:38:22,134
Come on. Everybody poops.

638
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,181
I read the book in medical school.

639
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:27,181
- Sinkers or floaters?
- This is the wizard.

640
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:30,490
Greasy and soft
or hard and pellet-like?

641
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:40,025
Floaters and...

642
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,379
the first one.

643
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,883
You just had to be so swoft.

644
00:38:48,678 --> 00:38:52,665
You're a hypocrite. No lies, no secrets,
but everything stops at your colon.

645
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:55,710
4,000 pages, not one word about bms.

646
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:58,866
- I bet yours don't smell at all.
- Nobody wants to hear about that stuff.

647
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:01,632
People who don't really
care about you don't. But doctors might.

648
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,242
The icky stuff changed,
right, a few months ago?

649
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,601
I became a vegetarian.

650
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:08,212
A lot of people misunderstand
how a vegetarian diet works.

651
00:39:08,337 --> 00:39:10,391
You take in less unusable material,

652
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,019
and your waste gets more efficient.
Harder and rounder.

653
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,153
Just look at the feces of rabbits.

654
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:17,768
- I think I might have some.
- Malabsorption.

655
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:20,026
Her system's not retaining
the necessary nutrients.

656
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,612
A G.I. infection
causes malabsorption,

657
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,353
granulomatous buildup of cells.

658
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:26,822
It's not contagious
since no one around her got sick...

659
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,347
Whipple's disease.

660
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,316
Let's split the credit.

661
00:39:31,711 --> 00:39:33,611
Start her on co-trimoxazole.

662
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,705
We all need some secrets.

663
00:39:36,848 --> 00:39:39,543
As long as they don't kill us,
they keep us safe and warm.

664
00:39:44,664 --> 00:39:45,664
I'm...

665
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,210
I'm gonna be okay?

666
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,919
You'll still need a new heart valve,
and you'll be on meds for a few years,

667
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:54,594
but, basically, yeah.

668
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:55,937
Your odds are good.

669
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:13,663
Thank God.

670
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,835
I think I wanna go
with the pig valve.

671
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,561
I know you'll go crazy
if you don't tell people.

672
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:39,201
Thank God you're an enabler.

673
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,518
Do you think people can actually
know each other better

674
00:40:48,643 --> 00:40:50,158
on the internet than face-to-face?

675
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:52,076
Faces can be distracting,

676
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:55,801
but there's nothing better
than looking into someone's eyes, and...

677
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:57,665
everything that goes with that.

678
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,175
I don't know.

679
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:02,460
People meet,
they like something superficial,

680
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:05,454
and then they fill in the blanks
with whatever they want to believe.

681
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,008
Why are you so hung up on this?

682
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:10,525
I refuse to believe it's all because
you just noticed you have a nice face.

683
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:12,388
You just came off a relationship.

684
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:14,756
You know things go deeper than...

685
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:19,814
Is that what this is about?

686
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:21,647
You and Cameron?

687
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:25,434
I was the one that pursued her.

688
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,987
Maybe I was just filling in
the blanks.

689
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:29,253
Maybe...

690
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:32,914
the first reaction was right.

691
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:35,040
We were just two people
who were in proximity

692
00:41:35,165 --> 00:41:37,393
and found each other attractive,
and I never...

693
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:38,372
<i>Paranoia.</i>

694
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:40,397
You felt something real.

695
00:41:40,522 --> 00:41:41,572
So did she.

696
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:44,128
Don't try to take it back now.

697
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:48,278
Can I borrow your car?

698
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:02,357
Why would it make more sense for you
to read your father's book

699
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:04,928
- than to go talk with him?
- Can you write a book?

700
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,066
So I can stop talking to you?

701
00:42:14,852 --> 00:42:16,775
You weren't looking
for some big catharsis.

702
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,925
You didn't want to hug the guy.
You wanted to know how his head works.

703
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,206
How he thinks.

704
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,032
'Cause I'm fascinated
with how ministers think.

705
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,907
Because you're not ordinary.

706
00:42:26,032 --> 00:42:28,079
You're way out there
on the fringe somewhere.

707
00:42:28,204 --> 00:42:31,117
I'm your best friend, and half the time,
I don't understand you.

708
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,576
You're alone.

709
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:34,220
Been alone your whole life.

710
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,281
When you read that book,
you were hoping that

711
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:42,001
somewhere, underneath
all that talk of God,

712
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,757
there would be a way of thinking,

713
00:42:43,882 --> 00:42:45,864
a mind that you could recognize.

714
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:47,889
You wanted what we all want.

715
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:50,765
The power to transform
into any water-based object?

716
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,240
To look across the gulf and know
there's someone else like you.

717
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:58,034
At least tell me this...

718
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,932
did you find something there?

719
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,080
Underneath the God stuff...

720
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:05,668
More God stuff.

721
00:43:11,306 --> 00:43:13,367
Get maintenance to take that down.
