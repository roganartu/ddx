1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,511
One small step for men...

2
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:13,982
One giant waste
of your monthly allowance.

3
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:18,286
Safeties disengaged.

4
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:21,522
We're go for launch
in five, four,

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,458
three, two,

6
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:24,525
one!

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,965
That was freakin' awesome!

8
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:38,840
Whoa.

9
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:40,842
Aw, jeez. Come on.

10
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:58,660
My father's gonna kill me!

11
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:00,628
Can I film that too?

12
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:16,644
Whoa!

13
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:18,646
What?

14
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,784
Oh, man...

15
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:24,585
Is that guy dead?

16
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:25,820
I think so.

17
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,093
Aah! Aah! Aah!

18
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:37,632
It's okay, sir.

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,967
Get the rest of the flames out!

20
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:45,640
You... you gonna be okay,
mister?

21
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,547
It smells like...

22
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:55,149
Like licorice.

23
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:10,496
Sync by ThreeSixes
www.addic7ed.com

24
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:30,585
Think House is coming in today?

25
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:33,121
Maybe if we start
offering spa treatments.

26
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:35,256
He already
jumped off of a hotel balcony.

27
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:37,391
Who knows what he'll do next?

28
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,162
Ride some kind of
prostitute chariot to work?

29
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:50,671
First person to offer me
an interesting case

30
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:51,906
gets to ride her...

31
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:54,475
Single or double-team.

32
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:59,847
My scooter,

33
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,349
which, you know, said out loud,

34
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,850
sounds even more inappropriate.

35
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:05,453
Seriously?
You're bringing them to work now?

36
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:07,321
23-year-old homeless
man brought into the E.R.

37
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,990
with burn injuries and...

38
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:11,192
let me guess...
diagnosis was fire.

39
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,594
He said his burning flesh
smelled like licorice,

40
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:15,263
and the E.R. antiseptics

41
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,332
like blueberry muffins.

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,101
Cool.

43
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,736
Dysosmia...
could be anything

44
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:24,105
from an environmental factor
to an early sign

45
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:25,673
of a degenerative
brain disease.

46
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:29,377
Smells like a winner.

47
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:33,114
Okay, you and Chase go check out
the park where they found him.

48
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:36,450
You two load him up
with Prednisone,

49
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:37,919
give him
an odor I.D. test.

50
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:40,822
If he's still mistaking
his body odors for candy,

51
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,857
the problem's definitely
in his brain.

52
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:46,894
Also, find out what else
he's lying about...

53
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:48,663
Since I'm assuming
"Ferris Bueller"

54
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,565
is not his real name.
Why?

55
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:57,972
Seriously, who is that?

56
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,242
They say he's a righteous dude.

57
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,845
Before I forget,
I want you to meet Dominika.

58
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:05,580
She's about to become

59
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:07,882
a permanent member
of Team House.

60
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,151
Nice to me meetings you all.

61
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,086
Doing what exactly?

62
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:13,020
Me.

63
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:16,057
We're getting married
on Friday.

64
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,527
Mount up!

65
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:21,095
I don't think that
two people are supposed...

66
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:22,563
Living on the edge, baby doll!

67
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:29,103
How's the arm?
Hmm?

68
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,371
It hurts.

69
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,507
Do I have to check out now?

70
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:34,642
Not until we figure out

71
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,811
why your sense of smell is off.

72
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,747
When was the first time
you noticed it?

73
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:41,682
Maybe a couple months ago.

74
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,718
We also need you
to tell us your real name,

75
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:48,322
so we can review
your medical records.

76
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,292
I didn't ask
to come here, okay?

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,394
I'm not paying for any of this.
Don't worry.

78
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:54,762
I don't think
the collection agency

79
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,997
has an office in the park.

80
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:59,500
I don't have a medical history.

81
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,035
I've always been healthy.

82
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:02,169
What about those scars

83
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:04,405
and burn marks?

84
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:10,411
Lean forward.

85
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:22,757
My dad...

86
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,126
We didn't exactly get along
when I was a kid.

87
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:27,528
How many times
were you hospitalized?

88
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:32,033
Never.

89
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,567
He was good at it.

90
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:35,736
Made sure he never did anything

91
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:37,672
that couldn't be covered up
by a sweatshirt.

92
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:40,675
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:44,145
No, don't be.

94
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:46,447
I'm not.
The past is the past.

95
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:48,282
That's why I don't like
talking about it.

96
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:05,733
You can't ride
that thing in here.

97
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:06,968
Speaking of things,

98
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,602
I'm having one on Friday.

99
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,504
If you want to drop by,
we'd love to have you.

100
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,974
No pressure.

101
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,275
You're still standing on it.

102
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:15,943
So I am.

103
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,545
Perhaps you're not familiar

104
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:20,314
with New Jersey
handicap ordinances.

105
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:23,851
Or perhaps I am.

106
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,621
They apply to wheelchairs
and powered scooters only,

107
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,123
not toys.

108
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:31,158
Have you any idea
how much this toy cost?

109
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,260
I don't care.

110
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:35,162
For some reason, my leg's
been hurting a lot this week.

111
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,431
For some reason,
I still don't care.

112
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:41,002
Fine.
I'll return it.

113
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,805
Do I have to walk it
out of here?

114
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:46,040
Stop.

115
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:50,544
I'll make an exception
for your leg.

116
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:53,447
But next time,
check with me first.

117
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:06,827
Congratulations
on your engagement.

118
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:08,562
I hear a strange voice.

119
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,532
A very soft-looking man.

120
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,868
Must be the Wilson.

121
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,336
I know we said no secrets,

122
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:17,438
but I think I need to
take this alone, honey bunny.

123
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:20,241
Okay.

124
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:22,843
Nice to be meeting you.

125
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:35,556
You're trying to screw
with Cuddy.

126
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:37,892
Yeah, it's the classic
"You dumped me,

127
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,894
so I'm gonna get married
a week later" ruse.

128
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,496
'Cause not only
is she that stupid,

129
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:44,331
but apparently I'm that stupid.

130
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,600
Then what, you're
openly mocking marriage...

131
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:48,002
trying to prove
it means nothing?

132
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,270
It doesn't.

133
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:52,173
But you proved that
yourself years ago.

134
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,441
I'd love to keep guessing,

135
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:55,242
but I've got people
with tumors waiting.

136
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,945
Why do you want us to think
that you're getting married?

137
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:00,581
Only one theory left...
I am.

138
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,950
Dominika needs a green card.

139
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:06,587
So you're just doing
some random stranger a favor?

140
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,823
It's illegal.
People go to jail for that...

141
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,658
Pay huge fines.

142
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:12,393
Have you seen me
practice medicine?

143
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:15,362
You know how much it costs
to have a live-in maid,

144
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,732
personal assistant, cook,
massage therapist, whore?

145
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:22,670
I do.

146
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:25,506
She's willing to work
four days a week for free.

147
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:28,409
It's gonna save me
about $33,000.

148
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:31,378
All I have to do
is say two stupid words...

149
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:34,782
"I do."

150
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,485
And if she doesn't see it this way?
Iron-clad prenup...

151
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:40,254
We go our separate ways.

152
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:42,523
Your stunned look, I take it,

153
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:45,693
is your way of saying,
"Brilliant idea, House."

154
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:02,676
Wow.
You look different.

155
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:04,111
The Prednisone
has had time to work,

156
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,614
so we need to give you
the odor I.D. test now.

157
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:09,416
Sure.

158
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:11,952
We need you to tell us
what you smell.

159
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,554
Oh...

160
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:15,923
Something spoiled...

161
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:18,058
Maybe rotting meat?

162
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:20,427
It's baby powder.

163
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,301
I kind of like that one.

164
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:28,669
Peppermint?

165
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:31,338
It's extremely bad body odor.

166
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,077
Well, you got to admit,

167
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:38,812
that one's kind of
a good deal for me.

168
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:43,450
My backpack.

169
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,085
Oh, where'd you find it?

170
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:48,556
In the park, right next
to a big pile of questions.

171
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:50,791
What kind of
drugs you shooting up?

172
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:54,128
Vitamin supplements.

173
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:57,731
I've been trying to boost
my immune system.

174
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,401
All right, test me
if you don't believe me.

175
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:02,336
Ferris tell you
his real name yet?

176
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:03,771
Peter Johnson.

177
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:06,307
Danny Jennings.

178
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:09,176
I bought those books used.

179
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:11,145
All from the same guy?

180
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:14,315
I'm sorry, you know,
I think I should check out now.

181
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:17,084
And I should... Ow!

182
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:18,352
What's wrong?

183
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,853
Oh, my stomach.

184
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:22,156
Gastrointestinal bleeding.

185
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:29,742
Is anyone else
disturbed by this?

186
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,110
What?

187
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,946
She offered.

188
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:34,414
Danny may have
lied about his name,

189
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:36,516
but he was telling the truth
about the vials.

190
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:39,752
Tests confirm they were
vitamin A and B12.

191
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,723
He also enjoys vitamin H.
The kid's a junkie.

192
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,826
Tox screens were
negative for drug use.

193
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:50,597
His hair wasn't.
I had it tested...

194
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:52,832
'Cause unlike Santa
and the Easter Bunny,

195
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,501
homeless, non-mentally ill
20-somethings

196
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:57,470
without drug problems
don't exist.

197
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:58,838
He was a heavy user

198
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:00,440
sometime in the last
five months.

199
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:02,342
Wow.

200
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:04,010
That was incredible.

201
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:05,778
Thank you.
No, thank you.

202
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:08,514
I like a man
with the big, strong, sexy feet.

203
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:10,617
He really puts the "mani"
in the "pedi."

204
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:12,518
If he has a
history of snorting heroin,

205
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,554
he could have caused
the dysosmia himself.

206
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,589
But we still need to explain
the bleeding in his G.I. tract.

207
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:17,924
Vitamin injections
could have caused that...

208
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:19,792
Hypervitaminosis A syndrome.

209
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,294
So his symptoms
aren't connected.

210
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:23,096
House, you buying this?

211
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,066
Not usually.

212
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,702
But this guy's been sleeping
on a bed of dog poop.

213
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,504
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's got

214
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:34,240
six different symptoms
for six different reasons.

215
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:36,576
The bleed could be caused
by a G.I. obstruction.

216
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:39,245
Vitamin O.D.
makes sense, and it's easier to treat.

217
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:41,114
Give him Tocopherol
and zinc supplements

218
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,949
for the excess vitamin A.
If we're right...

219
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,517
He could go homeless tomorrow.

220
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,718
And if we're wrong,

221
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:47,520
his intestines could get
further distressed,

222
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:49,656
while we ignore
the G.I. obstruction.

223
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:51,991
See what happens when
women don't have to serve men

224
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,259
to stay in the country?

225
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:55,461
The get all uppity.

226
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:57,030
This is why
we invented green cards.

227
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:59,632
Go X-ray the guy's abdomen,

228
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,001
if it'll make you feel
all equal.

229
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:16,549
I need a favor.

230
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:18,251
I want to add my fiancee's name

231
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:20,520
to my health insurance
a few days early.

232
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:21,888
She wants to get a tooth capped

233
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:24,357
before the big day.

234
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:26,859
I'm not signing this.
I agree.

235
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,695
I think she looks beautiful
the way she is.

236
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,599
Oh, no, wait.

237
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,568
You're not signing that
for moral reasons?

238
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:40,039
You're declaring yourself
the sole arbiter of true love?

239
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,442
'Cause you covered
Taub's wife for years.

240
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:44,510
It's fraud.

241
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,219
She wanted me to bribe you,

242
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:54,787
like they do
back in the old country.

243
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:56,456
Tell her what I said.

244
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,524
This is America...
the land of the home

245
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:00,059
and the free of the braves.

246
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,361
Yeah, I just get
teary-eyed

247
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:03,730
every time I hear her say that.

248
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:05,798
She brought you a gift.

249
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,767
Almond kulich...
I make with own hands.

250
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,635
I-it's delicious.
Almond kulich...

251
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:13,306
How can you say no to that?

252
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:15,842
You realize if I do sign this

253
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,677
and you don't get
legally married,

254
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:19,645
you'll lose your insurance
with our carrier?

255
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:23,149
Yes.

256
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,653
Fine.

257
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:30,456
It's your life.

258
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,428
I wish you both
the best with it.

259
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,729
Thank you.

260
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:43,536
North, miss Teschmacher!

261
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:48,241
Your blood test was clean,

262
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:50,309
but your hair showed
heroin use.

263
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:54,046
I've been clean
over three months now.

264
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:55,381
How'd you kick it?

265
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:59,085
I had to die first.

266
00:13:59,153 --> 00:14:01,254
I O.D.'d back in November,

267
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:02,889
and they said
I was clinically dead

268
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:05,925
for several minutes.

269
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:08,928
It was like God gave me
a second chance

270
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:10,763
to do things right this time.

271
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,933
You're saying God cured you?

272
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:18,004
No.
State rehab cured me.

273
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:22,108
But I should be dead,
but I'm not.

274
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:24,644
It has to mean something.

275
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:28,347
I mean, I-I must be here
for a reason, right?

276
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,652
Did you figure out the reason?

277
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:36,122
My goal is to become
a doctor one day.

278
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,126
I am smart.

279
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:44,697
I mean, I got a scholarship
for premed out of high school.

280
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:45,865
Chase...

281
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:51,103
Look.

282
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:56,209
We found 13 masses spread
across the wall of his colon,

283
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:58,277
ranging from two
to eight millimeters.

284
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:00,279
It can't be tumors.
Edges are too sharp and defined.

285
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:01,781
I thought it might be
parasites,

286
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:03,950
but we didn't see any movement
between X-ray exposures.

287
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:05,785
And no larvae or eggs
were observed

288
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,253
in any of his stool samples.

289
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:09,655
Which is kind of surprising
for a homeless junkie

290
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:11,924
living in a park.
Ex-junkie...

291
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:13,860
Claims he's been clean
for over three months.

292
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:16,295
And he's not planning
on staying homeless.

293
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:18,097
He's trying to protect
his health,

294
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,433
which is why he's been taking
vitamin supplements.

295
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:21,901
He wants to be a doctor.

296
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:24,937
He's just telling you
what you want to hear.

297
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:27,807
Once an addict,
always an addict.

298
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,775
Can you...

299
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:31,811
Please not do that
in front of me?

300
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,579
Doubt it.

301
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:35,448
You're the main reason
I'm on the stuff.

302
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:37,683
We could be looking
at fungal masses

303
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:39,652
hanging off the walls
of his colon.

304
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,387
Start him
on Amphotericin "B" tonight,

305
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:42,855
and in the morning,
run a scope up

306
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,190
where the sun don't shine,

307
00:15:44,258 --> 00:15:46,959
see if you can find
any truffles.

308
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:52,498
I think we should boycott
this wedding on principle.

309
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,534
I kind of have to go.

310
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:57,136
His fiancee did give me
a foot massage.

311
00:15:57,204 --> 00:15:59,939
And he invited me
to be in his wedding party.

312
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:01,974
W-what about Chase?
He ask him?

313
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,577
Yep. He's in it.
What the hell?

314
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:07,079
You just said
you weren't even going.

315
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:08,848
I still have feelings.

316
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,017
What's that?

317
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:15,021
That's definitely not a fungus.

318
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:17,690
You were bleeding because
you had 13 pieces of bone

319
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:18,925
in your digestive tract.

320
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:21,827
We think you have pica,

321
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,362
a craving for nonfood items

322
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,331
that's caused
by a chemical imbalance...

323
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,734
I didn't crave them.
I kind of...

324
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:30,670
Volunteered to eat them.

325
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:32,538
W-what? Why?

326
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:33,973
There's this great
Italian restaurant

327
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,274
I like to frequent.

328
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:37,810
And by "restaurant,"

329
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,745
I mean their dumpster out back.

330
00:16:39,813 --> 00:16:42,048
The cook is kind of
a friend of mine.

331
00:16:42,115 --> 00:16:44,016
He challenges me to eat stuff.

332
00:16:44,084 --> 00:16:45,418
Sometimes it's raw squid,

333
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:47,486
or, you know, I have to chew
on a chicken bone.

334
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:50,122
But if I do it, then he
hooks me up with real food,

335
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,892
not just the garbage.
Great friend.

336
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,560
These fragments could have
perforated your colon

337
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:55,728
and killed you.

338
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,263
You have to promise us
you'll stop.

339
00:16:57,331 --> 00:17:00,833
I think there's
something wrong with my eyes.

340
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,935
What is it?

341
00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:05,538
Uh, it's like I'm looking at you
from the bottom of a well.

342
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,567
If we add tunnel
vision to the dysosmia,

343
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:24,137
we can subtract the bone-induced
abdominal bleeding.

344
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:27,240
I thought the
dysosmia was from heroin.

345
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:29,710
He said he never snorted.
He just shot up.

346
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:31,612
So that wouldn't have affected
his sense of smell.

347
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,915
And we believe
the lying liar why?

348
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:36,083
House...

349
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,785
Are you even listening to us?

350
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,954
I'll start when you decide
what the symptoms are

351
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,356
and give me some theories.

352
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:44,191
If we combine the dysosmia

353
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,593
with the tunnel vision,

354
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:50,297
the symptoms fit
for western equine encephalitis.

355
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:53,166
But the patient doesn't...
no fever.

356
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,969
Ow!
What the hell?

357
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:58,205
Negative reinforcement.

358
00:17:58,272 --> 00:17:59,840
What about
Foster Kennedy Syndrome?

359
00:17:59,907 --> 00:18:01,908
He could have a meningioma
or plasmacytoma.

360
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:04,077
Started by pressing
on his olfactory nerves,

361
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:05,712
it affects his sense of smell,

362
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,615
and now it's growing and
pressing on his optic nerve.

363
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:11,251
Good.
MRI his head, find it.

364
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,487
Your potential donation...

365
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:17,958
Hey, hey.

366
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:20,193
...Have an immediate impact
on our community.

367
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:22,295
We could extend the hours...

368
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,868
Something wrong?
No.

369
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:29,836
I just think maybe it would be
a better idea to have a tour

370
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:31,338
of the clinic first.

371
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:33,173
It's right this way.
Oh...

372
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:38,612
Oh!
Oh!

373
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:44,918
Uh...

374
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:49,089
We have several patients
that are children,

375
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:51,191
and we find that it's important

376
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:52,559
to give them
the opportunity to play

377
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:57,197
to make the hospital
a less intimidating place.

378
00:18:57,265 --> 00:19:01,835
M-my dad used to lock me
in a closet,

379
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:04,071
and it... and it feels
like I can't breathe.

380
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:07,140
We need you to stay still.

381
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,076
Give him a break.

382
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:10,711
You want him squirming around?

383
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:11,978
We'll have to do it twice.

384
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:14,347
I want you to show him
a little respect.

385
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:18,051
You really think this kid
can turn his life around?

386
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,687
He believes God gave him
a second chance.

387
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,255
That kind of belief
can be powerful.

388
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:25,058
Masters doesn't surprise me.

389
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:26,793
He plays the fellow med student

390
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,895
who dreams of being a doctor
and reels her in.

391
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:32,199
But you falling for his
deep connection with God?

392
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,633
He has hope.

393
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:34,901
After all he's been through,

394
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:36,937
it kind of makes me
root for him.

395
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:38,238
We don't even know who he is,

396
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,640
except that he lies
about who he is.

397
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,044
The bit about his abusive father
is probably all made up.

398
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:45,946
And he faked the scars?

399
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:47,948
He's a punk. Probably got
into a lot of fights.

400
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:52,285
And he sucked you in
using the dad story.

401
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:53,787
I don't think
I'm feeling very well.

402
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:57,023
I think I'm...

403
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:58,759
He's vomiting.

404
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:01,628
Should I ask him to stay still
while he does that?

405
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:06,666
He has two dark spots
in the parietal cortex.

406
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,168
They're not tumors...

407
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:11,738
Maybe some kind of, uh, injury
or inborn defect.

408
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:13,607
Apparently he was
clinically dead

409
00:20:13,674 --> 00:20:15,408
for several seconds
when he O.D.'d.

410
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:17,177
The dark spots
could be brain damage

411
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:19,679
from oxygen starvation.

412
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:21,414
Except it's not.

413
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:24,017
I've seen MRI imagery
like that in schizophrenics.

414
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,919
Three serving two.
But schizophrenia doesn't explain

415
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:28,054
why his blood pressure
skyrocketed,

416
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:29,289
and he threw up in the MRI.

417
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:30,891
Panic attack.
He's claustrophobic.

418
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,492
He was fine
once we let him out.

419
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,227
The dysosmia and tunnel vision

420
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,328
could be hallucinations.

421
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:37,264
Except, as was already covered,

422
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:41,368
he was screened for
mental illness down in the E.R.

423
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:42,602
In your head!

424
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,771
It's "face."
On your face!

425
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,840
Close enough.

426
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:48,275
The E.R. docs missed it,

427
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:50,210
because he didn't present
with major symptoms yet.

428
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:51,511
We're seeing it in its infancy.

429
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,046
So we treat him, and then what?

430
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:58,118
He becomes just another
schizophrenic homeless man

431
00:20:58,186 --> 00:20:59,953
wandering the streets...
We have to help him.

432
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:02,422
I'd love to, but I got
four million other crazy people

433
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,057
ahead of him
on my to-do list,

434
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,194
along with milk.

435
00:21:14,302 --> 00:21:15,902
You two spent months
trying to figure out

436
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,070
a way to date
and not have it affect

437
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:18,471
your working relationship.

438
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,007
Now you need to do
the same thing for not dating.

439
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:25,345
No, I don't.

440
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:27,447
This is serious.

441
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:29,816
Did you know that she's...

442
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:33,854
She's dying of guilt and feels
horrible for dumping me.

443
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:35,088
It's great.

444
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:37,424
I mean, not the dumping part,

445
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:38,959
but the part where she'll now

446
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:41,261
let me do whatever I want.

447
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:43,730
So you're just trying
to punish her?

448
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:46,099
She feels bad,
and your only goal

449
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,567
is to take advantage?

450
00:21:47,635 --> 00:21:50,103
That's not true.

451
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:52,339
I got plenty of goals.

452
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:55,342
One of them is a 60-inch
flat screen right there.

453
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:00,614
You're a lot of things, House,
but you've never been a sadist.

454
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:02,515
You're pummeling

455
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,552
an opponent
who isn't fighting back.

456
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:15,262
I already gave him
a second dose of Clozapine.

457
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:18,498
You don't need... I'll bet you 50
bucks his favorite sport is hockey.

458
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:19,900
How could you possibly
know that?

459
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,568
Just a hunch.

460
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:23,904
How you feeling?

461
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:25,472
My arm kind of hurts.

462
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:29,476
I'll talk to the nurse
about upping your pain meds.

463
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:32,812
Hockey, eh?

464
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,515
Oh, my nephew
bought it for me...

465
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,817
Knows I'm a huge fan.

466
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:43,123
I hate hockey.

467
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:51,197
If this is schizophrenia,
you're gonna need regular care.

468
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:53,166
I found some shelters that have

469
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:54,567
full-time medical staff
and also...

470
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:56,403
Oh, my arm really hurts!

471
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,438
Let's have a look.
Ow...

472
00:22:58,506 --> 00:23:00,674
It feels like it's on fire!
We need to take a look under the bandages.

473
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:02,709
Ow! No, no, no.
Not that one, this one!

474
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:15,761
Ahoy there, me hearties!
Permission to come aboard.

475
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:22,935
♪
♪

476
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:33,613
Danny said his left arm
felt like it was

477
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,947
on fire last night.

478
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:37,683
We assumed it was
a schizophrenic delusion, but...

479
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,919
It's not.
He's on Clozapine.

480
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:41,554
He'd be getting better,
not worse.

481
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:44,090
Sounds like
regional pain syndrome.

482
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:45,525
Has to be a genetic disorder.

483
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:49,295
Would you slow down!
You're gonna get us arrested.

484
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:50,830
I wouldn't worry about it.

485
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:52,999
We'll probably die first.

486
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,567
Don't make me take my shoe off!

487
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,235
We need to run his DNA.

488
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:58,371
He could have early onset
of Parkinson's.

489
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,107
Or cortical-based
ganglionic degeneration

490
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:02,775
or Huntington's or any one
of a dozen other

491
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:04,510
genetic diseases.

492
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,612
Hey, if you let us out,
we can start testing.

493
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,948
If we're gonna test
for them all, it'll take weeks.

494
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:11,918
I'm not canceling my honeymoon
to treat this kid.

495
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:14,320
It's a fake marriage,
but a real honeymoon?

496
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:15,621
Most are.

497
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:17,223
Danny could also die

498
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,824
before we get through testing
for all the possibilities.

499
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,326
So we cheat.

500
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:23,362
Since it's genetic,
daddy or mommy's got it too.

501
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,997
They're either sick or dead.

502
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:26,499
He doesn't know
where his mother is,

503
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,100
and he won't tell us
where his father is.

504
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:34,240
He's a homeless
ex-junkie.

505
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:36,342
Are you telling me
that you four geniuses

506
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,811
can't outwit him?

507
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,580
Green light!

508
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:50,289
Cuddy got it for me.

509
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:52,291
And now I'm drafting a request

510
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,993
for a study
into the effects of caffeine

511
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,595
involving an Italian
espresso machine

512
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,830
and a massage chair,
so make it quick.

513
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:00,766
I found Danny's father.

514
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,234
Well done.

515
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:03,936
The kid said he was
in a state-sponsored rehab

516
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,171
last November.

517
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:07,273
There's only one Danny Jennings

518
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,108
that was in treatment
at the time,

519
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:10,810
and he listed
his father's address

520
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,613
as his primary next of kin.

521
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,715
The "well done"
was for making it quick.

522
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,350
Now I'm gonna have
to take that back.

523
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,652
He lives about 30 minutes
from the hospital.

524
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,354
And the reason
you're continuing to talk

525
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:22,955
instead of driving there?

526
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,891
Chase and Masters
are already on their way.

527
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,002
Why didn't you ask me
to be part of your wedding?

528
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:39,171
You are genuinely upset
at being mockingly snubbed

529
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,406
by a mock wedding?

530
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:43,142
Is it because
I haven't been here

531
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,477
as long as them?

532
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:48,514
Or is it that you
really don't like me?

533
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:51,217
Or are...
are you just s-screwing...

534
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:54,120
Um...

535
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:01,460
I'll...

536
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:05,765
I'll come back
when she's finished.

537
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:07,967
She is.

538
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,204
Oh, my God!

539
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,674
W-what did you think
she was doing?

540
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,543
She's just installing
the cable.

541
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:20,646
That's not a euphemism!

542
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:23,949
Oh, I feel sorry
for the little one.

543
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,919
Isn't there something
we can do?

544
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:38,531
Can I help you?

545
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,866
We need to talk to you
about your son Danny.

546
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,369
Danny?
Who are you?

547
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:44,937
We're his doctors.
We need to know if you,

548
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,872
or perhaps his mother,
have any family history

549
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,140
of genetic disease.

550
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,810
Why? What difference
would it make?

551
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:54,513
You may not care
about your son, but...

552
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:55,815
Is that what Danny told you

553
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:58,384
when he was in rehab...
We didn't love him?

554
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,419
Um, not why we came here.

555
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:01,987
We just want to know

556
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:04,890
if there's any diagnosed
genetic disease in your family.

557
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,158
We're trying

558
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:07,426
to make your son better.

559
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:10,129
Better?

560
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:11,997
He died of a drug overdose.

561
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,933
We buried him three months ago.

562
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,218
Who are you?

563
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:45,555
The important question is,
who are you?

564
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,622
Danny Jennings is dead,

565
00:27:47,686 --> 00:27:50,488
which means that
Danny Jennings has no pulse.

566
00:27:50,555 --> 00:27:53,291
You, on the other hand...

567
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:55,171
Do.

568
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:59,208
Ergo, you are not
Danny Jennings.

569
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:01,777
Or I did the test wrong.

570
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:03,245
So why don't you cut the crap

571
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:06,081
and tell me your real name.

572
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:07,716
No.

573
00:28:07,784 --> 00:28:11,353
Hiding your identity...

574
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:14,023
Well, either you're a criminal
or a superhero.

575
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,926
I'm not a criminal.

576
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:19,295
Awesome.

577
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:21,997
What color is my underwear?

578
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:24,500
I'm not telling you my name.

579
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:29,572
No problem.

580
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:31,273
I just need your father's name.

581
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,678
Forget it.

582
00:28:35,745 --> 00:28:38,180
Care to tell me why?

583
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:44,086
He looking for me.

584
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:48,891
He supposedly...

585
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:52,161
Cleaned up and got sober.

586
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,964
And now he...

587
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:57,433
he wants to be a part
of my life again.

588
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,003
And I can't let that happen.

589
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:03,639
You're a big boy now.

590
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:06,442
You still think
he can hurt you?

591
00:29:08,912 --> 00:29:11,013
You don't get it.

592
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:14,883
If I ever see my dad again...

593
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:21,190
I'll kill him.

594
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:36,105
What's happening to me?

595
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,175
Well, luckily for you,

596
00:29:40,243 --> 00:29:43,612
we don't need daddy
to figure that one out.

597
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:51,754
Did you find out his real name?

598
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:54,223
Cerebellar ataxia.

599
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,191
That's a weird name.

600
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:59,061
The guy whiffed twice
trying to pick up a cup

601
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:00,262
right in front of him.

602
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,665
That plus everything else...

603
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:12,107
Means that we have whittled
our list of genetic diseases...

604
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:15,477
All the way down to one...

605
00:30:15,545 --> 00:30:18,781
Early-onset Parkinson's.

606
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:20,716
After everything
he's been through,

607
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:22,151
now we have to tell him,

608
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:25,554
"Hey, you have
an incurable disease

609
00:30:25,622 --> 00:30:27,790
that gets
progressively worse."

610
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:30,959
You could lie.
I'm fine with that.

611
00:30:31,027 --> 00:30:32,761
But you'll probably
both feel better

612
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:35,698
if you give him Levodopa
and confirm with DNA tests.

613
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,775
He's gone too far.

614
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:49,211
He's taking up
six handicapped spaces

615
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,979
with a monster truck.
It's only four,

616
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:52,614
and he's gonna get rid of it
after the wedding.

617
00:30:52,682 --> 00:30:54,483
And the chapel...
He's turned the chapel

618
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:55,684
into his own personal
catering hall.

619
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:56,952
Who cares?

620
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,987
Other than a janitor
sleeping off a bender,

621
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:01,090
he's the first person
to use it in two weeks.

622
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:03,859
Appeasement is never the answer

623
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:05,327
in the face
of naked aggression.

624
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:07,463
It won't be long
before his tanks

625
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,432
are rolling down
your Champs-Elysees.

626
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,737
I know what House is doing.

627
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:16,505
You, on the other hand...
Why do you care?

628
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:17,973
He isn't hurting anyone.

629
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:29,685
You're the first boss
he's ever had

630
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:31,887
who could handle him.

631
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:34,056
Before you, he was either fired

632
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:36,325
or buried under a mountain
of malpractice suits.

633
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:40,496
He needs someone to say no.

634
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:42,865
He needs someone
he'll listen to

635
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:45,367
when they say no.

636
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:47,002
If you really care about House,

637
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,737
you'll stop feeling
sorry for him

638
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:51,340
and get out there
and start kicking him

639
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:53,942
where he needs kicking.

640
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:02,551
I changed my mind.

641
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,087
What, you want the fish
instead of the chicken?

642
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:06,822
This room is
for patients' families,

643
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,024
not for doctors trying
to defraud the government.

644
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:12,461
Oh, so...

645
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,363
You've decided
to take a moral and.

646
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:15,764
Yeah.

647
00:32:15,832 --> 00:32:17,900
The chapel still has sanctity
for some people.

648
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,067
You're right.

649
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:20,335
I think I saw blue the janitor

650
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:22,371
passed out in one
of the pews last week.

651
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,207
It's "Lou," and I would have
thrown him out too.

652
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:28,877
Well, where are we gonna go?

653
00:32:28,945 --> 00:32:31,180
We got caterers staging
everything downstairs

654
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:32,648
as we speak.

655
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:34,683
We've got floral arrangements,
place settings...

656
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:36,685
Other wedding-y stuff.

657
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:39,488
That's not my problem.

658
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:42,991
I sent out the invitations.

659
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,560
People are coming here.

660
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:48,597
That's also not my problem.

661
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:57,206
And I want the TV back.

662
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:08,016
You should just let me die.

663
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:13,288
The world's better off
without me.

664
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:15,924
It's normal.

665
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:22,364
People feel depressed
when they get bad news...

666
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,433
Because it's bad news...

667
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:29,004
Obviously.

668
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,676
I didn't O.D. by accident.

669
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:36,512
I was trying to kill myself.

670
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,183
Why?

671
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:49,958
'Cause I've done things...

672
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:53,529
Horrible things.

673
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:55,631
I've hurt people.

674
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:59,334
And when I didn't die,

675
00:33:59,402 --> 00:34:00,769
I thought...

676
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,408
I thought God forgave me.

677
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:13,015
But he just wanted me
to suffer.

678
00:34:13,082 --> 00:34:14,516
And I deserve it.

679
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:22,157
You don't deserve it.

680
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:27,663
I...

681
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,267
I had a girlfriend
in college...

682
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:36,271
And I almost killed her.

683
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:39,708
I just snapped.

684
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:46,181
And I started hitting her.

685
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:49,217
And if her roommate
hadn't come home...

686
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:58,860
I'm evil.

687
00:34:58,928 --> 00:35:02,030
I am just like my dad.

688
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:06,501
We're both monsters.
I deserve to die.

689
00:35:14,877 --> 00:35:18,647
I can't... I can't...

690
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,015
I feel dizzy.

691
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:25,454
I need a crash cart in here!

692
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:36,088
His heart is dilated
and failing.

693
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:38,457
And at the rate it's happening,
he'll need a new one soon.

694
00:35:38,525 --> 00:35:41,861
And there's no way we'll get him
on the transplant list.

695
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:43,696
What are we missing?

696
00:35:43,764 --> 00:35:46,232
Everything. We know nothing
about this kid.

697
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,002
Except that he's gotten worse
since we admitted him.

698
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,571
Why?

699
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:53,673
Most of our patients
tend to do that,

700
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,141
unless we cure them.

701
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,777
Yeah, but why so fast?

702
00:35:57,844 --> 00:35:59,512
He had dysosmia
for a couple months,

703
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,080
never even came here
to get it treated.

704
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:04,083
He's just a random burn victim.

705
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:07,553
We get him, boom,
he's got tunnel vision,

706
00:36:07,621 --> 00:36:09,121
peripheral polyneuropathy,

707
00:36:09,189 --> 00:36:12,792
cerebellar ataxia,
and now cardiomyopathy.

708
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:15,628
What's different here
than, say, living

709
00:36:15,696 --> 00:36:17,964
in a filthy state park?

710
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:20,199
You think cleanliness
is making him sick?

711
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:22,201
Allergic reaction?

712
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:24,337
We treated him
with Vicodin, Clozapine,

713
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:26,038
and one I.V. bag
of Levodopa.

714
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:29,675
His condition started
deteriorating before that.

715
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:34,046
Stop that man!

716
00:36:34,114 --> 00:36:36,582
I need the meal card

717
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,819
for the patient in 243.

718
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:49,428
He's eating healthy...
Because he can.

719
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:54,300
Most of the meals in here
are vegetarian.

720
00:36:57,471 --> 00:37:00,539
Adult Refsum disease...

721
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:02,341
Fits all the symptoms.

722
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:04,610
His body can't process

723
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:07,647
the phytanic acid
and chlorophyll.

724
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,181
It's his healthy diet
of green vegetables

725
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:10,516
that's killing him.

726
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:13,452
So if we change his diet...
We save his life.

727
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,454
Run him through a
plasmapheresis treatment

728
00:37:15,522 --> 00:37:17,757
to remove the excess
phytanic acid from his blood.

729
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:19,792
Confirm with gene testing.

730
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,462
Okay, I got to go get married.

731
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:37,877
♪
♪

732
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:55,494
They say true love
doesn't exist anymore.

733
00:37:55,562 --> 00:37:57,396
Maybe it never did.

734
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:03,002
So without further ado...

735
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,541
Do you, Dominika Patrova,
take this man

736
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:09,875
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

737
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:12,478
I do.

738
00:38:18,118 --> 00:38:20,586
And do you, Gregory House,
take this woman

739
00:38:20,654 --> 00:38:23,656
to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

740
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:29,361
Yep.

741
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:32,131
Then by the power vested
in me by the state of New Jersey

742
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,499
just for today,

743
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:35,334
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

744
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:36,969
You may kiss the bride.

745
00:38:41,174 --> 00:38:43,476
Those of you with cameras,
please feel free

746
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:45,377
to provide legal documentation.

747
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:04,563
It's okay.
I'm just angry at myself.

748
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:10,803
I promised I wouldn't let
this get to me.

749
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:12,972
But it got to me.

750
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:17,009
Just say the word, and we will
climb out that window right now.

751
00:39:19,412 --> 00:39:22,848
I wouldn't give House
the satisfaction.

752
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:25,117
You see?

753
00:39:25,185 --> 00:39:28,621
Things are getting
back to normal.

754
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:31,657
Yeah...

755
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:34,493
Normal.

756
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:36,662
Are you feeling better?

757
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:43,035
So all I have to do is eat
the right kinds of food,

758
00:39:43,103 --> 00:39:44,236
and I'll be okay?

759
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:45,704
Basically, yeah.

760
00:39:45,772 --> 00:39:46,839
It's pretty limiting,

761
00:39:46,907 --> 00:39:48,440
and it is for the rest
of your life.

762
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:51,210
But if you follow the diet
and get checked up regularly,

763
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:54,580
you should be fine.

764
00:39:54,648 --> 00:39:56,649
Thank you...
Mm-hmm.

765
00:39:56,716 --> 00:39:58,751
For not giving up on me.

766
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:04,824
You're not a bad person.

767
00:40:04,891 --> 00:40:07,459
You made mistakes,
but we all do.

768
00:40:07,527 --> 00:40:11,497
Maybe when you get
out of here, you can...

769
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:13,766
Go talk to someone...

770
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:16,802
A professional.
Yeah.

771
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,771
Yeah, some of those places
you suggested

772
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,807
had people on staff.

773
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:25,144
You know, I think God
really does have

774
00:40:25,212 --> 00:40:27,680
a plan for me.

775
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:31,383
And all this...
It was just his way

776
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:34,987
of testing my resolve.

777
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:38,457
And I wouldn't have passed it
without you.

778
00:40:43,597 --> 00:40:45,764
See you tomorrow, Danny.

779
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:50,436
That's not my real name.

780
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:56,742
It doesn't matter.

781
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,572
I know this is not
real marriage...

782
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,141
But I really like you.

783
00:41:32,112 --> 00:41:35,281
I like you too.

784
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:55,067
I can't.

785
00:41:55,135 --> 00:41:57,636
Why not?

786
00:41:57,704 --> 00:42:02,207
I never sleep
with married women.

787
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:03,609
I'm going to bed.

788
00:42:03,677 --> 00:42:05,678
You can take the couch.

789
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:23,729
What's going on?

790
00:42:23,797 --> 00:42:27,433
Danny disappeared
without checking out.

791
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,269
So you called the FBI?

792
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:33,739
We didn't call
them, they just showed up.

793
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:35,841
Danny's DNA...

794
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:37,309
When we sent it to the lab
for testing,

795
00:42:37,377 --> 00:42:41,213
it set off alarm bells
all over the country.

796
00:42:41,281 --> 00:42:42,982
Alarm bells for what?

797
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:47,820
He's linked
to 13 unsolved murders

798
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:49,355
in ten different states.

799
00:42:49,422 --> 00:42:52,324
He's a serial killer
who eats his victims.

800
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,860
And we saved him.
