<i>He's moving</i>

109
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:41,131
and his employees
are hanging him in effigy.

110
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,300
Could have moved on
to the real thing.

111
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,635
Pupils are normal.

112
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,503
Thyrotoxicosis?

113
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,990
Not...A terrible idea.

114
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:52,693
I'm gonna go
give him P.T.U.

115
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:55,145
and T.L.C.

116
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:57,814

that second one stands for.

117

126
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,139
Not all migraines
present that way.

127
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,858

139

144
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,260

Patient's

They're being relocated.

170
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,892
The fact that you see that
as inherently bad

171
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,628

172

Drag Queens in Uganda.

180
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:41,161
Patriotism is nothing
but loyalty to real estate,

181
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:42,913
real estate that's been
conquered 800 times

182
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:46,250
by 800 different regimes
with 800 different cultures.

183
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:49,036
But each time,
it's just the best.

184
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,038
I claim this burger

185
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,706
in the name of
Queen Isabella of Spain.

186
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:56,794
I'll go check
on the patient.

187
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:58,295
I have Hepatitis C.

188
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,302
She got it from me.

189
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,031
Hey, how's my dad doing?

190
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:19,399
Ah, great.

191
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:20,901
His vision's back to normal,

192
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:23,237
and if he remains asymptomatic
through the night,

193
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:24,721
we'll be able to release him
in the morning.

194
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,590
Any chance that could
happen before 9:00?

195
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:28,992
Our stock dropped
a couple points today

196
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,077
with the news
that he's sick.

197
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,495
I would love for him
to get out of here

198
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:34,197
before the market opens.

199
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:36,583
No offense, but, uh,

200
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:38,735
I think it's terrible
your dad's closing down

201
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:41,505
all your American operations.

202
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:45,275
I don't think he's
moving the company out of greed.

203
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:48,478
He's moving it
out of grief.

204
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:52,049
My mom, she died
four months ago.

205
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,018
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
and...

206
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,888
It's been hard for him--
living in their house,

207
00:08:57,939 --> 00:08:59,489
driving down
the same streets.

208
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:01,575
I mean, he's constantly
reminded of her.

209
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,111
Dad?

210
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:08,415
<i>I need</i>
<i>an intubation kit in here!</i>

211
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:09,399
What's going on?

212
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:13,558
Angiography showed
a hemorrhagic site

213
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,726
in the left lower lobe.

214
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:17,679
I think it could be
hyperviscosity syndrome.

215
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:20,382
Are you sure Foreman's
okay with this thing

216
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:21,850
in his office?

217
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,969
He's never gonna know.

218
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:26,221
He's actually in here
right now.

219
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,223
Blood count and protein count
are normal.

220
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,775
I think it could be
hyperviscosity syndrome.

221
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,311
Sorry, but after Park
sent out here hospital-wide

222
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,447
non-apology apology
this morning,

223
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,198
I assume that plagiarism
is the new black.

224
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:38,984
If it makes Andrews
look sympathetic...

225
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:41,269
Copying him makes you
look pathetic.

226
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,306
And I will pay you not to go
to anger management classes.

227
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,124
What about another
clotting problem?

228
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,109
Factor 5
Leiden deficiency.

229
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,461
<i>It's possible.</i>

230
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,663
Adams is the one who needs
to deal with her anger.

231
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:53,348
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

232
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,549
I heard about
your conversation

233
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:55,884
with the patient's daughter.

234
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,002
You were hostile.

235
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:58,653
Well, their company's
making a decision

236
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:00,255
I strongly disagree with.

237
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,157
Yet you were never
anything but courteous

238
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:04,509
to the racists and rapists
in prison.

239
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:06,011
Those guys made decisions
you supported?

240
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:07,729
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

241
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:09,264
I'm guessing it has something
to do with the funeral

242
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:11,032
you attended
yesterday morning.

243
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,651
I was at a job interview.

244
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:14,402
You got to work at 9:15.

245
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,137
Closest hospital with
an opening in your specialty

246
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:17,639
is 45 minutes away.

247
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,640
It's not possible.

248
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:19,974
My condolences.

249
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:21,359
I wasn't at a funeral.

250
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:26,364
That just leaves...

251
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,183
Everywhere
but a job interview.

252
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,417
Get out.

253
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:30,535
<i>Who goes there?</i>

254
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,753
Reveal yourself!

255
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,954
Now.

256
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,155
<i>Well, we would.</i>

257
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:36,508
<i>But Orthopedics</i>
<i>is still squatting</i>

258
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:38,376
<i>in two thirds of my office,</i>

259
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:39,511
which is weird,

260
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:43,998
'cause you got
a large check last night.

261
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,934
From a corporation
that's going through

262
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:47,736
a very public
belt-tightening.

263
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:49,838
<i>Means this donation</i>
<i>was given under duress.</i>

264
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,556
<i>Patient didn't tell me</i>
<i>the whole story,</i>

265
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:56,061
but he did say he'd be thrilled
if we didn't cash this.

266
00:10:58,064 --> 00:11:00,015
Got a policy review meeting
in here in five minutes.

267
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:00,899
Good-bye.

268
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:11,743
What are you doing?

269
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:13,161
Holding your ass.

270
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:14,579
You really
didn't know?

271
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:16,464
- House...
- Just trying to help you out here.

272
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,166
I figure for sure
he'd punch me in the face,

273
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:20,168
thus proving
it's a natural response.

274
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:26,508
My God, you have
super-human discipline.

275
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,259
And glutes.

276
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:29,778
Get your hands off me.

277
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,268
Sorry.

278
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:39,421
Go.

279
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,191
Why...did you do that?

280
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,026
We have a bet.

281
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:47,278
But he's the chair of
the disciplinary committee.

282
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:50,165
Forget about the bet.

283
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:53,001
You two really need
to do your homework with me.

284
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:55,620
Treat the patient with
activated protein c.

285
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:56,904
If he has
myelodysplastic syndrome,

286
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:58,289
he'll bleed out.

287
00:11:58,374 --> 00:12:00,458
And if he has Factor 5
Leiden deficiency,

288
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:01,710
he'll throw another clot.

289
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:02,844
Exactly.

290
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,212
It's a conclusive test.

291
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,014
There's no actual risk.

292
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:07,849
As long as you're
both paying attention,

293
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,585
and are both good enough
to work here.

294
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:17,776
I hear one of you thinks
I'm a real bastard.

295
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,644
I guess
that would be me.

296
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:21,229
Your boss uses blackmail,

297
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:23,565
and you question
my professional ethics?

298
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:26,868
Will you be instituting
worker safety regulations

299
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:28,136
in your new factories?

300
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:29,287
Oh, absolutely.

301
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:30,338
What about juice boxes
in the break room

302
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:31,906
for the children
you'll be hiring?

303
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:33,508
Charges of
child exploitation

304
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:34,743
against American companies

305
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,745
have been blown
way out of proportion.

306
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:39,447
My ten-year-old cousin
lives near Cebu City.

307
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:41,416
<i>Works at</i>
<i>an American factory.</i>

308
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:43,117
I am so sorry.

309
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:46,454
It's the best thing
for him.

310
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,890
It sucks, but the Filipino
factories suck worse,

311
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:50,975
and the schools would suck
if they existed.

312
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,361
So this is the family's
best hope.

313
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:57,315
Are you okay?

314
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,600
Is this supposed
to itch like this?

315
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,023
Itching.

316
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:06,157
Interesting.

317
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:07,358
Not interesting.

318
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:08,660
Already went away.

319
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,361
Doubly interesting.

320
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:11,696
Means we have
to explain the arrival

321
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:14,115
and the departure.

322
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,818
Oh.

323
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,336
That's real mature, House.
What do you mean?

324
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,038
This is outlandishly
childish.

325
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:21,206
I custom-built this puppy.

326
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,291
It's got 106 leds,

327
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:25,877
each one sending light
to your eyes,

328
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,295
slightly different
wavelength.

329
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:29,264
Turn that off.
Different wavelengths

330
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:31,549
are stimulating your
autonomic nervous system.

331
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:32,967
<i>That's what's making you</i>
<i>feel like you're on a boat</i>

332
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:34,219
in choppy waters.

333
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:40,892
Oh ho ho! Cool.

334
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:47,866
You think I'm not--

335
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,868
you think I'm not gonna
go to Foreman with this?

336
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:50,902
Oh, you will.

337
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:52,320
And...I'll deny it,

338
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:53,688
and he'll believe you.

339
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:55,874
But then these two
believe that the policy

340
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,209
<i>of protecting American jobs</i>
<i>starts at home.</i>

341
00:13:58,294 --> 00:14:01,162
So they'll never
testify against me.

342
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,363
<i>And you won't be able</i>
<i>to prove anything.</i>

343
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:06,217
Now, if I punched him
in the face,

344
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:08,469
that he could prove.

345
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:10,138
<i>I remember you saying</i>
<i>something about</i>

346
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:12,540
<i>how loyalty to real estate</i>
<i>was stupid.</i>

347
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:17,211
This is about
reclaiming stolen property!

348
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:18,713
Loyalty to real estate
is stupid,

349
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:19,981
because loyalty is stupid.

350
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:21,983
First patriotism,
now loyalty.

351
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,484
You hate ice cream too?

352
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:25,220
French vanilla, yeah.

353
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,939
<i>To willfully identify</i>
<i>yourself as something else</i>

354
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:29,824
is a perversion
of self-expression.

355
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:30,825
<i>I had a thought.</i>

356
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,327
<i>Other than the fact</i>

357
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:35,496
that loyalty is the basis
of all meaningful relationships.

358
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:37,148
<i>The daughter said</i>
<i>that her mother died</i>

359
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:38,633
<i>of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</i>

360
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:40,335
What if she was misdiagnosed?

361
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,806
Dutch chocolate's
not bad.

362
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:46,341
Gotta give 'em that.

363
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:47,909
<i>Her lymphoma could have</i>
<i>been caused by a virus,</i>

364
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:50,712
HTLV-1, which
our patient contracted

365
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:52,480
through having sex
with his wife.

366
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:55,466
In other words,
loyalty gave him cancer.

367
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:56,584
I like it.

368
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:58,136
Start him on radiation.

369
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,824
Chang and Eng Bunker.

370
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:04,826
It's the most famous
conjoined twins in history.

371
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:06,361
2011 is the bicentennial
of their birth.

372
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,280
The best Halloween costumes

373
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,532
are always the ones
that need an explanation.

374
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,234
<i>What took you so long?</i>

375
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:15,286
I already lost
one of them.

376
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:16,621
You need help
with the lacerations?

377
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:18,873
No, I think
I got palliative.

378
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:19,991
Why don't you
take preventative?

379
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,876
Prevent what?
He got in a fight.

380
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:23,177
<i>Which he started.</i>

381
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:25,330
Which means he's both
irascible and stupid.

382
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:26,915
I told the drunk,
racist frat guy

383
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,666
the proper term
is "conjoined twin,"

384
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:29,634
not "Siamese."

385
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:31,085
I can't comment

386
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,954
on the drunk or the frat.

387
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:34,839
But Chang and Eng
were both, in fact,

388
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:36,224
born in Siam.

389
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:38,559
And they were,
in fact, twins.

390
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:40,094
If your name was Richard,
it would be okay

391
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,163
for me to call you a Dick.

392
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,681
<i>But maybe</i>
<i>some of the tripe</i>

393
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:45,132
you learn
in anger management class

394
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:46,701
might help keep this guy
out of here

395
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:47,769
<i>the next time.</i>

396
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,855
Sometimes,
it's incredibly satisfying

397
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,075
<i>to wind up and punch someone</i>
<i>who really deserves it.</i>

398
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:55,243
But when you think
about the consequences--

399
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,577
Okay, let's go.

400
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:58,613
I thought you wanted me
to help him with his anger.

401
00:15:58,664 --> 00:15:59,697
No, I got
everything in need.

402
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,817
Sometimes...
- Sometimes...

403
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:04,151
It's incredibly satisfying

404
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:06,754
to wind up and punch
someone who deserves it.

405
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:09,257
Wonder what the committee's
gonna make of that.

406
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:15,813
This is a waste of time.

407
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:17,982
There's no way that Robin
gave me an STD.

408
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,771
I know this is hard,
and I'm sorry

409
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,139
<i>about your wife.</i>

410
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,975
<i>If you'd like</i>
<i>to talk to someone,</i>

411
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,110
we do have grief counselors
at the hospital.

412
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:30,228
<i>You sound</i>
<i>like my daughter.</i>

413
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:31,646
I miss my wife,

414
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:34,048
but it's not driving
my decision-making.

415
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:38,786
You were CEO since 1988.

416
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:41,723
You decided to move your company
right after your wife died.

417
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,759
<i>It stands to reason</i>
<i>that your emotions factored in.</i>

418
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:48,930
My wife...

419
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:51,232
is the only thing
that keeps me here.

420
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:57,088
I visit her grave
once a week.

421
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:02,443
So your daughter
was wrong.

422
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:04,929
You just...really need

423
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:07,932
<i>a lot of money.</i>

424
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:10,118
You ever hear
of Kongo Gumi?

425
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:17,058
Construction company in Japan
founded in the year 578.

426
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,061
Family-owned and operated.

427
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:25,333
Building Buddhist temples
for 50 generations.

428
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:29,637
We--went bankrupt
five years ago.

429
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:34,675
You have any idea how
that last CEO must have felt?

430
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:39,781
Sorry, I...have to move.

431
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:47,388
Your heart rate
is speeding up.

432
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,589
Do you feel any tightness
in your chest?

433
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,025
Yes, I figured
it was from the radiation.

434
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:52,610
I think you're having
a heart attack.

435
00:17:56,782 --> 00:17:57,982
Come in.

436
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:01,702
Dr. Wilson...

437
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,437
I need your advice.

438
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:06,440
Um...I bet House $100

439
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:07,792
that I wouldn't get fired

440
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:10,294
after my
disciplinary hearing.

441
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:12,213
Ever since then,
he's been acting like

442
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,582
he's actually trying
to get me fired.

443
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,452
That's because he is actually
trying to get you fired.

444
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,454
Does he hate me?

445
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:20,988
Not sure that's relevant
to the equation.

446
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,157
So it's really over $100?

447
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:25,026
Not sure the amount
is relevant.

448
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:25,927
He's fighting for his honor.

449
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:28,129
He'll ruin my career.

450
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,848
- Not sure that's--
- What if I bet him $200

451
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,900
I will get fired.

452
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:34,535
He sees competing debts
with the same person

453
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:36,370
as a disgrace to the game.

454
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:38,673
He'll be even more
motivated to beat you.

455
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:44,362
If you were me,
what would you do?

456
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,315
You have to give him something

457
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:49,050
he values more than honor.

458
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:53,921
And you should
update your resume.

459
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,329
<i>EKG and troponins</i>
<i>were equivocal.</i>

460
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,892
It's not even clear
if our patient

461
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,744
just had a heart attack
or what it was.

462
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:11,280
Let's look at segmental
wall motion abnormalities.

463
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:13,082
Get him an echo
to confirm.

464
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,785
I need $200,000.

465
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,454
His company's lost
one third of its value

466
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:20,372
since he was admitted.

467
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:22,241
And you want to do
some insider trading?

468
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:23,876
I take it felonies

469
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:25,427
aren't a violation
of your parole?

470
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:26,629
It's not insider trading.

471
00:19:26,713 --> 00:19:28,714
Just betting on myself
to solve the case.

472
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:30,916
Once we cure him,
share price goes up,

473
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:31,917
I pay you back.

474
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:33,519
No.

475
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,420
No, you don't say "no."

476
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,690
You...make a counter offer.

477
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:39,608
I'm not
loaning my boss money.

478
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:41,360
Fine.
I'll make you a counter.

479
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:42,928
$100,000.

480
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:45,447
$20,000.

481
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,765
I'll buy options
instead of shares.

482
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:47,950
More risk,
but more upside.

483
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:49,618
But that's as low
as I'm gonna go.

484
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,205
I could do $5,000.

485
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:54,823
Really? No backsies.

486
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:57,826
If...you double
your clinic hours.

487
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,995
Six a week.

488
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,964
I've seen how you
disrespect those patients.

489
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:03,966
So you want twice as many
of them disrespected?

490
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,801
Spend more hours with them,

491
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:08,470
you'll treat them
more humanely.

492
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:12,007
And this time,
a land war in Russia

493
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:14,126
will be a good idea.

494
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,561
Deal?

495
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:18,463
Here's what
I'm thinking.

496
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:19,848
You went to
a parole hearing,

497
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:22,651
where one of your old patients
was denied.

498
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,687
Hence the attire,
hence the tardiness.

499
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:27,439
And, most important,
hence the anger.

500
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,408
You think you can
restore the cosmic balance

501
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:30,993
by doing extra good here.

502
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:33,329
More annoyingly,
by having me do it

503
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,983
and deal!

504
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:05,861
Of course, you know...
this means war.

505
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:07,863
Oh, I know.

506
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:09,615
I mean, you'll escalate,

507
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:10,616
and then I'll retaliate,

508
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:11,900
and the cycle will continue

509
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:13,652
until we've both
gone too far,

510
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:16,622
at which point, I'll...
maybe get suspended

511
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:19,959
and...you'll go
back to prison.

512
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:24,964
Happy pranking.

513
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:35,374
<i>Patient had V-tach</i>
<i>in the echo lab,</i>

514
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:37,142
<i>so we capped him, but...</i>

515
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,210
coronary arteries
were clean.

516
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:39,544
If the plumbing's fine,

517
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:40,813
check the electrical.

518
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,399
EP study.

519
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:45,384
Nice idea.

520
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:47,987
Even has a metaphor
in it.

521
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,355
Not worth more
than my honor.

522
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:50,823
But delightful,
all the same.

523
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,526
<i>I'm not going to lose.</i>

524
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:56,428
My college roommate
is the editor

525
00:21:56,496 --> 00:21:58,197
of <i>the Yale Law Review.</i>

526
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:00,599
She's writing
my opening statement.

527
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,701
You will be eloquent
in your loss.

528
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:04,837
This case boils down
to he said, she said.

529
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:06,922
He said, "I've been working
at this hospital for 15 years

530
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:08,924
and I'm taking
self-improvement classes."

531
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:11,126
She said, "I've been
a fellow for two months,

532
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:12,578
and I'm kind of weird."

533
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:14,013
No, he said,
"I'm a drunk idiot

534
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,547
"who thinks he can
grab girls' behinds

535
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:16,949
without ramifications."

536
00:22:17,017 --> 00:22:18,384
Wait, he was drunk?

537
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:20,252
- In the hospital?
- <i>I already told Foreman</i>

538
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,453
he'd been drinking
that night.

539
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:23,572
Andrews was taking
sexual harassment classes,

540
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,059
not AA.

541
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:30,229
That means he didn't
get in trouble for drinking.

542
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:32,064
Which means that Foreman
signed off on it,

543
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:35,668
which means that he set
all the wheels in motion.

544
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:40,005
Forget that.
Wild speculation.

545
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:41,790
Go do the EP study.

546
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:49,882
You already knew Andrews
was drinking that night,

547
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:52,451
didn't you?

548
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,819
Yes.

549
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:56,722
I think you should
cancel my hearing.

550
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:01,593
I hope this isn't going
where I assume it's going.

551
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:02,728
You're the one
who brought Andrews in.

552
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:05,297
You set the wheels
in motion.

553
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:12,521
We had a patient
who was going to die

554
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:15,140
without
an AVM embolization.

555
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:18,811
Andrews...was the only
neurologist I could reach.

556
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:20,662
He told me had
a few glasses of wine,

557
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:21,864
and that he shouldn't do it,

558
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:24,316
but he also said
that you were good.

559
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:27,686
You were ready to do one,
as long as you were supervised.

560
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:29,288
So we agreed
that he would come in,

561
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:31,190
but wouldn't
touch the patient.

562
00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:33,542
I can understand
the rationalization.

563
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:34,826
We'll see
if the Board agrees

564
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,896
when I tell them
the whole story at my hearing

565
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:41,834
I already did.

566
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:44,670
I had a closed session
hearing last week.

567
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:46,671
The Board decided to dock me
two weeks pay.

568
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,360
Oh.

569
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:55,447
Been working for House
for two weeks.

570
00:23:55,515 --> 00:23:56,815
It's already too long.

571
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,706
No sign of any
electrical abnormalities

572
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,191
in the right atrium.

573
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,544
I'm so dead.

574
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:10,796
I-I think House set me up.

575
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:12,898
<i>Have you sent</i>

576
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:15,918
the committee
a character reference for me?

577
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:17,803
I thought you
don't like favors.

578
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,138
I don't like gifts.
It wouldn't be a gift.

579
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:21,089
I would just be you
telling the truth.

580
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:23,108
I hardly know you.

581
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,429
O2 sat is 89.

582
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,097
<i>Did we perforate?</i>
<i>Is he tamponading?</i>

583
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:31,517
Heart rate's only 90.
Neck veins are flat.

584
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:32,935
Then why
isn't he saturated?

585
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,043
<i>Seems healthy to me.</i>

586
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:41,628
Let's release him.

587
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:45,198
My option to sell
Barton Foods at $34

588
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:47,000
is about to expire.

589
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:49,052
So they thought the patient
would be better by now.

590
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:52,806
Instead, I am
going to lose $20,000.

591
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:54,007
20?

592
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:56,876
Your five plus the five
I stole from Wilson.

593
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,544
<i>Plus the ten</i>
<i>I got on margin.</i>

594
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:01,064
<i>You're gonna have to talk</i>
<i>to my bankruptcy attorney.</i>

595
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:02,899
Unless...

596
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:05,852
There is a way that you
can get your money back.

597
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:07,604
Give me the full $200,000.

598
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:11,274
And extrapolating,

599
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:13,827
tomorrow you'll owe
just shy of $1 million.

600
00:25:13,894 --> 00:25:15,328
It's your own fault.

601
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:16,746
You forced me to go
with the options here.

602
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:20,450
Your damn anger issues
are screwing with my finances.

603
00:25:20,534 --> 00:25:22,418
Regular stock this time,
nice and safe.

604
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:23,837
I'm not angry.

605
00:25:23,904 --> 00:25:25,205
I don't know if you're
trying to make me angry.

606
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:26,539
You refuse
to bet on yourself.

607
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,124
That means
low self-esteem.

608
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:29,926
So if I give you
$200,000,

609
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,127
I'll feel smart
and pretty.

610
00:25:31,212 --> 00:25:33,079
Low self-esteem
can be brought on

611
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,414
by exposure
to one's relatives.

612
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:36,933
Nice clothes
and anger...

613
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:38,301
Classic symptoms.

614
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:39,686
Family gathering.

615
00:25:39,753 --> 00:25:41,721
You were late
the other day

616
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:42,922
'cause you were
having breakfast

617
00:25:42,973 --> 00:25:45,308
with grammy Adams
or cousin Itt.

618
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:47,810
And she was nagging you
about finding a husband.

619
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:49,779
All right, this
is getting annoying.

620
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:51,114
I'll just tell you
what I was--

621
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:52,949
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

622
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:54,433
No spoilers.

623
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,286
They ruin everything.

624
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,288
Pulmonology was that way.

625
00:25:58,372 --> 00:26:00,290
Our patient's lung problem
is not a lung problem.

626
00:26:00,374 --> 00:26:01,941
It's a brain problem.

627
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:03,793
We're consulting
with Neurology.

628
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:05,628
<i>That's my old boss.</i>

629
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:07,613
You don't actually think
this is neurological.

630
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:08,831
I don't know what it is.

631
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,283
<i>Maybe I should just</i>

632
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:12,335
accept the patient's death,
if getting help

633
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,921
can lead to awkwardness.

634
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:18,641
Dr. Andrews.

635
00:26:18,726 --> 00:26:19,809
<i>My associates.</i>

636
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:21,895
Doctors Adams and Park.

637
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:28,234
Ah. Nice to meet you,
Dr. Adams.

638
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:32,188
Hello, Dr. Park.

639
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:35,158
You two
know each other?

640
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:39,112
It's a small world.

641
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:40,747
Dr. Park, maybe
you'll like to update

642
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:42,582
our esteemed colleague

643
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:43,449
on the condition
of our patient.

644
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:49,505
Micropsia, bleeding,

645
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,875
tachycardia,
and difficulty breathing.

646
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:55,962
Cute butt, huh?

647
00:26:58,165 --> 00:26:59,933
Can we go now?

648
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,268
You really wanna
turn your back on this guy?

649
00:27:02,336 --> 00:27:04,670
Sorry.
Carry on.

650
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,773
Uh...Well...

651
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,007
It sounds like
there could be

652
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:09,359
spinal cord involvement.

653
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:12,211
Have you considered
normal pressure hydrocephalus?

654
00:27:14,782 --> 00:27:17,150
Okay, normal pressure
hydrocephalus

655
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:18,351
going once.

656
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:20,203
Normal pressure
hydrocephalus going twice...

657
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:22,121
It's not his spinal cord,

658
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:25,091
it's the wiring between
his heart and his brain.

659
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,710
Autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

660
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:28,828
You do a tilt table test,

661
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:30,596
see how his heart rate
responds.

662
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:31,998
That'll confirm.

663
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:34,300
Well, if he has
normal pressure hydrocephalus,

664
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:36,085
a tilt table test
could put him in a coma.

665
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,438
Then it's a good thing
he has A.D.S.

666
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:42,141
Do you really
believe in this diagnosis?

667
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:44,043
Because if this is
just a pissing contest,

668
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:45,728
you are at a severe
anatomical disadvantage.

669
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:48,681
It's autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

670
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:51,601
No...it's normal pressure
hydrocephalus.

671
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:53,419
<i>Do a spinal fluid test</i>
<i>to confirm.</i>

672
00:27:55,522 --> 00:27:57,223
We're doing the tilt table.

673
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:58,524
That makes sense.

674
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:00,526
You'd rather have House
fire you than Foreman?

675
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:01,694
This bet's
got to be a test.

676
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:03,162
See if I can handle
working with him.

677
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,198
I need to prove I have
the confidence

678
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:08,368
to disobey him.

679
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,036
Do you have any
medical justification

680
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:11,304
for your diagnosis?

681
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:14,573
The symptoms fit,
and Andrews is a hack.

682
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,125
Do you think I'm right?

683
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:23,016
Let's go.

684
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,768
No...you need to go
prepare for your hearing.

685
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:35,812
15 more minutes,
Mr. Barton.

686
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:39,098
A skin resurfacing laser
is missing.

687
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,317
And why are you
asking me about it?

688
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:42,869
Because you work for House.

689
00:28:42,936 --> 00:28:45,938
What would House want
with a skin resurfacing laser?

690
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:47,623
I have no idea.
Have you seen it?

691
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:50,276
<i>My feet feel hot.</i>

692
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:52,111
That's completely normal.

693
00:28:52,162 --> 00:28:55,164
No, but House has been
talking about

694
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,150
how badly he wants
to remove those prison tats.

695
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:58,751
It's a very expensive
machine,

696
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:00,253
and I'd like it back.

697
00:29:00,304 --> 00:29:01,787
Please tell me
if you hear anything.

698
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:05,892
How expensive?

699
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,493
$200,000.

700
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:10,980
He took it.

701
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:12,799
I have no idea.

702
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:14,767
Park's hearing's
about to start.

703
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:16,335
You're covering for him.

704
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:18,304
<i>I did the same thing</i>
<i>many times.</i>

705
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:20,239
My advice to you--
figure out what line

706
00:29:20,307 --> 00:29:21,841
you aren't willing
to cross for him.

707
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:25,645
Because, eventually,
he'll ask you to cross it.

708
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:33,219
How are your feet?

709
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:37,206
<i>Mr. Barton?</i>

710
00:29:40,544 --> 00:29:42,895
Can you hear me,
Mr. Barton?

711
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:47,216
Oh, no.

712
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:52,359
We have convened
the disciplinary committee

713
00:29:52,411 --> 00:29:54,328
to decide the appropriate
action that should be taken

714
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:56,798
against Dr. Chi Park
as a result of her actions

715
00:29:56,865 --> 00:29:59,801
on October 7th of this year.

716
00:29:59,868 --> 00:30:02,053
Dr. Park, do you have
an opening statement.

717
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:04,088
Dr. Foreman,
members of the committee,

718
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:05,756
thank you for giving me
this opportunity

719
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:07,642
to speak to you today, I...

720
00:30:09,228 --> 00:30:10,311
Good news.

721
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:11,429
<i>You can cancel</i>
<i>the hearing.</i>

722
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:12,546
'Cause I'm
firing her myself.

723
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:13,881
She's not yours to fire.

724
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:15,900
You guys better
fire her for insubordination,

725
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:17,819
'cause she went rogue,
and my patient is now in a coma.

726
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:18,769
I'm the one
who did the test.

727
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:20,104
<i>No, it was my idea!</i>

728
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:21,222
Seriously, House?

729
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:22,240
At least
I'm smart enough

730
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:23,574
to know what
I don't know.

731
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:25,109
<i>She went out of her way</i>
<i>to defy me!</i>

732
00:30:25,194 --> 00:30:27,778
<i>She needs--damn it,</i>
<i>you should just fire her!</i>

733
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:30,414
My apologies.

734
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:33,167
<i>My apologies, Dr. Park.</i>

735
00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:34,452
Dr. House's comments

736
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:36,120
<i>will, of course,</i>
<i>have no bearing</i>

737
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:37,588
on this hearing.

738
00:30:37,673 --> 00:30:39,957
Please continue.

739
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:45,746
I, uh...

740
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:47,131
I can't believe
you did that.

741
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:49,350
Right back at ya.

742
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:52,053
Our patient's dying.
We need theories.

743
00:30:52,104 --> 00:30:54,105
It's gotta be normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

744
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:55,973
Andrews predicted the coma.

745
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:58,392
Yeah, but even a broken
doctor's right twice a day.

746
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:00,811
Patient wasn't wet,
wobbly, or wacky.

747
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:03,064
Coma had to be
a lucky guess.

748
00:31:03,115 --> 00:31:05,432
If you didn't think
he was right,

749
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,535
then why did you want us
to collect his spinal fluid?

750
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:10,204
I didn't. I wanted you
to do a tilt table test.

751
00:31:10,272 --> 00:31:11,989
You have a wonderful way
of communicating.

752
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:13,958
I knew Park wanted
to do a tilt table.

753
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:15,442
She listens to me,
I waste an hour.

754
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:17,044
If she defies me...

755
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:20,447
Then I get the test I want
and my 100 bucks.

756
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:21,949
Up high.

757
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,784
You're an ass.

758
00:31:23,835 --> 00:31:25,753
You're angry.

759
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:27,838
Yes!
Now I'm angry.

760
00:31:27,923 --> 00:31:30,391
Let's run the test for normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

761
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,976
No.

762
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,145
What else would
explain our symptoms

763
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:38,432
and make our patient go
into a coma during that test?

764
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:40,134
How 'bout
hepatic encephalopathy?

765
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:41,519
No, we already tested
his liver enzymes.

766
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:42,687
They're normal.

767
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:44,188
Or his liver's so far gone

768
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:46,107
it can't even
produce enzymes.

769
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:47,491
That's desperate.

770
00:31:47,576 --> 00:31:49,493
Fits the symptoms.

771
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:51,546
And Andrews is a hack.

772
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:53,414
Go biopsy to confirm.

773
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:55,082
Unless you want
your own hearing.

774
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:58,536
You'd have
to hire me first.

775
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,922
<i>Nurse Williams to social services.</i>

776
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:03,090
<i>Nurse Williams to</i>
<i>social services.</i>

777
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,792
<i>So you do realize</i>

778
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:06,844
<i>that it is unacceptable</i>
<i>to hit someone</i>

779
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:07,962
in the workplace?

780
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,665
<i>Yes, completely</i>
<i>unacceptable.</i>

781
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:11,899
I wasn't thinking.

782
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:14,135
I guess, I mean--
yes, technically,

783
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:15,469
I was thinking.

784
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:18,539
I just...It happened
so fast,

785
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:20,074
<i>I did--I--</i>

786
00:32:20,142 --> 00:32:21,509
<i>I...</i>

787
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:23,844
It's like...

788
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:25,146
It's like
it wasn't even me.

789
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:28,515
I would never
do something like that.

790
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:31,285
Even though I did.

791
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:34,255
I'm sorry, I'm not
making any sense right now.

792
00:32:34,323 --> 00:32:37,058
I, um...

793
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,859
I don't know, I...

794
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:41,495
Just really love
being a doctor so much.

795
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:47,501
And I barely even have
$100 and...

796
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:49,737
Please don't fire me.

797
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:00,381
<i>Is this theory more promising</i>
<i>than the others?</i>

798
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:02,066
We'll know
in a few hours.

799
00:33:03,235 --> 00:33:06,187
How are you holding up?

800
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:09,774
Other than the fact
that my dad's in a coma...

801
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:10,908
Terrible.

802
00:33:12,594 --> 00:33:13,961
Tomorrow morning,
I am supposed to sign

803
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,630
a piece of paper
that will...

804
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:16,964
move the company

805
00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:20,067
and cost thousands
of employees their jobs.

806
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:21,936
I thought you'd
rather see the company

807
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:23,838
go under in New Jersey
than thrive in China.

808
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,341
It's what my dad wants.

809
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:28,876
<i>And it's still his company.</i>

810
00:33:28,944 --> 00:33:31,679
I'm really just
keeping the seat warm.

811
00:33:31,747 --> 00:33:34,181
But unless he wakes up
before tomorrow,

812
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:36,517
it's gonna be my signature
on that piece of paper.

813
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:46,794
You don't have to sign it.

814
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,067
I'll let you know
when we have the results.

815
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:14,295
Biopsy was clean.
It's not his liver.

816
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,964
I also ran
the spinal fluid test,

817
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:18,633
and you were right
that Andrews was wrong.

818
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:22,053
His ICP was not normal.
It was elevated.

819
00:34:22,138 --> 00:34:24,172
What about HTLV?

820
00:34:24,223 --> 00:34:26,057
We ruled that out
three days ago.

821
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:27,225
Because of his
heart problems, but--

822
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:28,843
Once something gets
taken off the board,

823
00:34:28,894 --> 00:34:30,562
I'm the only one who's
allowed to put it back on.

824
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,736
You owe me 106,804 won.

825
00:34:38,821 --> 00:34:41,156
Or $100 U.S.

826
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:44,659
God, but you're petty.

827
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:47,996
Okay, so...two options.

828
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,248
Either we figure out
what's wrong with this guy,

829
00:34:50,332 --> 00:34:52,000
or we figure out how to make
this company profitable

830
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,585
in New Jersey.

831
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:54,969
Eastern equine
encephalitis?

832
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,207
Thinking in here!

833
00:34:59,258 --> 00:35:00,058
<i>Brain scans indicate</i>

834
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:01,893
it could be Loa loa disease.

835
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,063
Ah, shut it off!

836
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,994
Apparently we're allowed
to do this now.

837
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,252
Get out of here, House!

838
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:34,709
Start the patient
on plasmapheresis.

839
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,512
He'll wake up in an hour.

840
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:42,267
It's been a pleasure
having you in the neighborhood.

841
00:35:55,564 --> 00:35:59,100
This diagnosis was brought
to you by the letter "y."

842
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:00,101
Dad...

843
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:02,487
God, you're okay.

844
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:03,705
I'm thirsty.

845
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:07,959
That's a side effect
of not dying.

846
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:11,996
<i>Turns out your blood</i>
<i>was getting thick and syrupy.</i>

847
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:14,382
<i>Complexes of large,</i>
<i>y-shaped antibodies</i>

848
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:16,968
were clogging up
your blood vessels,

849
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:19,420
causing your organs
to shut down one by one.

850
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:22,090
Now, usually with
hyperviscosity syndrome,

851
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,725
it's caused
by an elevated blood count

852
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:24,676
or protein count.

853
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,294
Yours eluded us

854
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:27,812
'cause it was caused
by antibodies

855
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,314
from your
rheumatoid arthritis.

856
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:31,182
Now that they're
being filtered out,

857
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:32,433
the blood would be...

858
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:33,935
A little less duck sauce

859
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:37,238
and a little more soy sauce.

860
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:39,474
So I'm gonna be
completely cured.

861
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,609
It's not all about you.

862
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,444
<i>Your stock price</i>

863
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:44,829
will be completely cured.

864
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:47,198
Once you sign this.

865
00:36:47,283 --> 00:36:48,783
It's a press release.

866
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:51,202
It says that you're healthy,
you're going back to work,

867
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:52,486
and you're
signing the lease

868
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:53,821
that officially
moves the company to China.

869
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:55,156
<i>He just woke up.</i>

870
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:56,991
Dad, you don't have
to deal with this right now.

871
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,426
Ah, mm, yeah, actually...

872
00:36:58,493 --> 00:36:59,877
He does.

873
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:01,963
<i>'Cause the market</i>
<i>opens at 9:00 a.m.</i>

874
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:04,766
And this means
a lot to me.

875
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:06,167
You may remember me

876
00:37:06,218 --> 00:37:08,686
from the time
I saved your life.

877
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,775
If you move it,
it'll be without me.

878
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:21,282
I know you object.

879
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,283
I know you disagree with--

880
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:24,085
Dad...

881
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:25,954
I can't do it.

882
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:31,242
If this is really
about family,

883
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:32,594
you will not do this.

884
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,544
Morning.

885
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:28,516
Got lucky this time.

886
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:29,767
No, you didn't.

887
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,519
I made this bet
so you'd stop

888
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:32,854
actively trying
to fire Park

889
00:38:32,921 --> 00:38:34,255
so you'd be neutral.

890
00:38:34,306 --> 00:38:36,724
You went out of your way
to help her.

891
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:37,975
She obviously
earned your respect,

892
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,394
passed
whatever test you--

893
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:40,695
I sabotaged her hearing.

894
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:42,563
You do read
the school paper, don't you?

895
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:45,149
If you had sabotaged
her hearing,

896
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:46,484
she would have gotten more
than a slap on the wrist.

897
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:48,786
What you actually did
was make her emotional

898
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:50,604
and make the board members
see her as a victim.

899
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:52,140
'Cause the panel
feels badly

900
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,742
for incompetent doctors
who nearly kill people.

901
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,444
You know that everyone
on that panel hates you.

902
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:58,579
You know the minute
you recommend firing anyone,

903
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,449
they start discussing
how big a bonus to give them.

904
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,167
That's just hurtful.

905
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:05,837
The fact is,
winning $100 from you

906
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:06,921
gives me more pleasure

907
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:09,841
than winning $100 from her.

908
00:39:09,925 --> 00:39:11,792
Here's your five grand.

909
00:39:14,096 --> 00:39:15,129
What five grand?

910
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:19,150
Just take it.
Trust me.

911
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:27,942
Found her sleeping
in the park.

912
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:30,644
Said she ran away because
her daddy didn't love her.

913
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:32,980
And that is exactly
what happened...

914
00:39:33,031 --> 00:39:34,782
as far as you can prove.

915
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,317
Congratulations.

916
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:38,152
You're not going
to jail...Today.

917
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:39,987
But you do know

918
00:39:40,055 --> 00:39:41,422
I just can't let this slide.

919
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,791
You need to keep up
your rep.

920
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,176
Fine. Clinic hours.

921
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
I'll double them.

922
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:48,663
Okay.
12 hours a week.

923
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:50,298
No...

924
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:52,300
Three times two
equals six.

925
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:55,186
And 3 times 2
times 2 is 12.

926
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,239
I know about your deal
with Adams.

927
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:05,396
Call Chase and Taub.

928
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:07,198
Get 'em in here.

929
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,849
The boys are back.

930
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:14,205
This check
is for significantly more

931
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,223
than what I told you
it would take

932
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,207
to fund the department.

933
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,625
I know.

934
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:29,103
You paged me?

935
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:48,889
Congratulations.

936
00:40:54,396 --> 00:40:57,898
You caught your boyfriend
cheating that morning.

937
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,450
You had a big fight.

938
00:40:59,535 --> 00:41:01,285
That's why you were late.

939
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:06,174
You re-pitched an S.T.D.

940
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:08,409
You haven't gotten
two consecutive minutes

941
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,844
without using
the word "loyalty,"

942
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,713
which explains the anger
and the low self-esteem,

943
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,432
and the desire
to feel pretty...

944
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:16,767
After having been rejected
explains the clothes.

945
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,758
It wasn't my boyfriend.

946
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,028
It was my husband.

947
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:31,032
I was at my lawyer's office
signing the divorce papers.

948
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:32,216
Wow.

949
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,770
I missed the fact
that you were married.

950
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:38,906
We've been separated
for almost a year.

951
00:41:40,742 --> 00:41:43,127
So...old news?

952
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:44,679
No anger left?

953
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,898
It's all bought
and paid for.
