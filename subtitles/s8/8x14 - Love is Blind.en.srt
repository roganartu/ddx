Telling you, Will,
you got a real winner here.

00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,712
She's just gonna love it.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,748
Stacy, box her up.

4
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,224
Oh. Just the box.

5
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:17,749
I'm sure it's prettier
than the paper.

6
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:22,030
One tiny rock.

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,065
So many other cool things I
could have bought for myself.

8
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:28,868
Sam, Stacy, it's been a pleasure
being ripped off by you.

9
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:41,481
<i>Such a nice boy.</i>

10
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:44,917
Too bad he's a handicap.

11
00:00:58,731 --> 00:01:02,100
Excuse me.

12
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:05,570
Thank you.

13
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:45,608
You all right, man?
Take it easy, man!

14

He's hyperglycemic

his blood tests showed

Where's House?

51
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,682
Uh, he's at an out-of-state
medical conference.

52
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:42,150
In Baltimore.

53
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:46,188
I think.

54
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:47,789
Nice to meet you.

55
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:49,657
I'm Blythe, his mother.

56
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,635
Do you want me to pick up
the braille writer

00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,204
and laptop
from your apartment?

58
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:05,039
I don't plan on being here
that long.

59
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:06,306
I didn't eat lunch yesterday.

60
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,175
I probably just fainted.

61
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,777
<i>Or had an epileptic seizure.</i>

62
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:12,645
Which is
only one possibility.

63
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm Doctor Chase.

64
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:16,315
Uh, we'd like to discuss your

<i>I'm his girlfriend.
Is it all right</i>

66
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:19,919
if I stay for this?
Melissa can stay.

67
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:21,955
And I've never had a seizure
before in my life.

68
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:22,956
They can be mild.

69
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,124
Like a loss of concentration

70
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:25,558
or a muscle tremor.

71
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:29,327
A lot of times a family member
notices before the patient does.

72
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,029
I'm Doctor Park, by the way.

73
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:34,599
I'm 5'2", Asian,
and I'm totally cool with it

74
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:36,268
if you wanna feel my face.

75
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:38,703
Blind people only
do that in movies.

76
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:41,606
But you sound nice,
so if you want me to...

77
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,776
Her point was,
you may not have realized

78
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,160
you were having a seizure, that
maybe your girlfriend has?

79
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,545
No.

80
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,616
But I--I haven't seen him
for the last five months.

81
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,752
We were on a break.

82
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,921
<i>Like Rachel
and Ross on Friends.</i>

83
00:04:56,955 --> 00:05:02,292
Never seen the show myself,
but I hear it's good.

84
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:05,128
That joke usually kills
my blind friends.

85
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:06,263
Will, this is serious.

86
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:07,264
No, it's not.

87
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:09,032
Since I don't have epilepsy.

88
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,500
I have to pay attention
to every signal

89
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,068
<i>my body sends or receives.</i>

90
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,037
Or I end up taking a dirt nap.

91
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:16,172
You don't think I'd know
if I was having seizures?

92
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:17,773
<i>It's probably just
low blood sugar.</i>

93
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:19,008
If that's true,
then you shouldn't have

94
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:22,744
a problem passing our test.

95
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,348
How is he, James, really?

96
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:28,650
He's better than I've seen him
in a long time.

97
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:30,352
Is he happy?

98
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:32,854
Uh...

99
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:34,155
<i>It's okay.</i>

100
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,992
He's always been
a complicated child.

101
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:41,129
Were you in
the hospital recently?

102
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:42,997
Oh, nothing serious.

103
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:45,266
<i>I just had a few moles
removed yesterday</i>

104
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:48,869
and forgot I even had it on.

105
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,107
Look, if Greg happens to get
back early from the conference,

106
00:05:54,142 --> 00:06:00,113
I'm staying at a hotel in town
for the next three days.

107
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:02,515
I would like him to call me.

108
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,817
I will pass it on.

109
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,185
<i>Thank you.</i>

110
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,786
<i>Um, do you think that
they would mind</i>

111
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:09,956
if I got a refill
for the road?

112
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,658
Not at all.
Good.

113
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:39,083
Not seeing
any seizure activity

114
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:41,118
in response
to low frequency sounds.

115
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,020
I'm starting him
on mid-range.

116
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:45,422
Have you seen his girlfriend?

117
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:47,491
Extremely hot.

118
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,860
Blind people can't have
attractive girlfriends?

119
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:51,061
Not my point.

120
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,461
He actually convinced her
to go for

121
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,397
the whole relationship
break thing.

122
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:56,165
How do you know
it wasn't her idea?

123
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,101
<i>Because she's back with him.</i>

124
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:00,503
Women suggest a break
when they wanna break up.

125
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:01,837
Men do it because
they wanna have sex

126
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:03,406
with other women
before they settle down.

127
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,043
They're a little young to get
married, don't you think?

128
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:10,879
I was their age when I did.

129
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,580
I see your point.

130
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,783
He's seizing.

131
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:16,952
<i>Sound frequency's at 300 hertz.</i>

132
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,621
It's not a seizure.

133
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,557
He's not spiking on his E.E.G.

134
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:25,626
He's not moving air.

135
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,297
I I think
he's choking on something.

136
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:30,664
Blood.

137
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,366
I don't see any blockage.

138
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:35,903
Help me move him.

139
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:46,546
Just relax and breathe.

140
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:58,858
What--what are these?

141
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:03,890
Three teeth detached
from his jawbone

142
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,359
and lodged in his throat.

143
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,194
He almost choked to death
on them.

144
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:08,195
Environmental?

145
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:09,363
Could be heavy metal
poisoning

146
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:11,265
or radiation exposure.

147
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:13,099
Then he wouldn't
be the only one.

148
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,233
He's an accountant
who works

149
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:15,668
on the same floor
with 50 other people.

150
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:20,206
Maybe his girlfriend
poisoned him.

151
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,142
House usually thinks
that's a good guess.

152
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:25,678
And she's gotta be pissed off
and have low self-esteem.

153
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,180
<i>Why else would she</i>

154
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:28,613
give him a free pass to pork
other women?

155
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:29,614
<i>Because he's handicapped.</i>

156
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:31,383
<i>Women feel sorry for us.</i>

157
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:32,717
<i>This cane is tail bait.</i>

158
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,619
Where are you now?

159
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:36,521
Expect an actual answer
this time?

160
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:37,622
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

161
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:38,723
<i>Was wondering if House's</i>

162
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:39,791
<i>mother left yet.</i>

163
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,560
<i>He won't let me go to a hos--</i>

164
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:43,061
<i>It's not environmental,
it's periodontitis.</i>

165
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:45,429
An oral infection doesn't
explain his disorientation

166
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:47,565
and auditory hallucinations.

167
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,032
<i>They're laughing
because they know</i>

168
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,934
<i>diabetes exacerbates
the condition.</i>

169
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:53,036
<i>It could progress
to a systemic disease.</i>

170
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,406
The bacteria spread
and affect other organs.

171
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,707
<i>Like his brain.</i>

172
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:58,576
<i>Start him on broad spectrum
antibiotics</i>

173
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,876
<i>and book him an appointment
with a periodontist.</i>

174
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:06,583
He has fake children now,
too?

175
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:10,420
You think I'm not good enough
for your mother.

176
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:12,455
Not in front of the kids,
Honey.

177
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,497
Hey, add a couple of flies,
toss in a dead goat or two,

178
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:22,998
we might have a winner.

179
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:25,000
She gone?

180
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:27,236
Yeah.

181
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,105
We really need to talk.

182
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,240
Okay.

183
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:32,806
Crayons down.

184
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,276
Line up if you wanna get paid.

185
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,082
It's the only time I ever
successfully lie to my mom;

186
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:43,417
<i>is through the elaborate
preparations</i>

187
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,119
and props.

188
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:50,423
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

189
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,793
I said no Transformers,
Slick.

190
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,331
Stay here until
the coast is clear.

191
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,433
Fine.

192
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:02,502
But you sleep on couch
tonight.

193
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:04,137
You sleeping with her now?

194
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,306
Just in case an I.N.S. guy
comes in through the window.

195
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,407
Oh.

196
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,575
Yeah,
she didn't buy it either.

197
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,877
You need to talk
to your mother.

198
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,878
When I'm ready.

199
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,513
Still need to get
a fake passport,

200
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,649
doctored photos,
maybe a case of Aids.

201
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,884
She's sick, House.

202
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,221
Did she say that?

203
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,756
She was wearing a hospital
admission bracelet

204
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,660
and carrying around a book on
dealing with terminal cancer.

205
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:32,230
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:40,837
She's staying at the Grand
for the next three days.

207
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,650
The antibiotics will stop
the infection

208
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:56,452
from spreading further.

209
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:57,720
And I'll spare you
the lecture you'll get

210
00:10:57,754 --> 00:10:58,854
from the periodontist
tomorrow,

211
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:02,425
but you need to practice
better oral hygiene.

212
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,994
So are you guys saying this is
happening because, what,

213
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,296
<i>- I didn't floss enough?
-  Probably didn't help,</i>

214
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:10,932
but diabetics are prone
to this type of infection.

215
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:12,066
Half the time,
he doesn't even bother

216
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,801
getting undressed
before he goes to bed.

217
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:15,337
<i>Can only imagine how many times
you've skipped</i>

218
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:17,472
<i>brushing your teeth since we--</i>

219
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:21,109
sorry.

220
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:22,844
<i>I don't mean to lecture you,
babe.</i>

221
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:25,879
Well, I guess you're right.

222
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:27,981
Look, you haven't eaten
anything all day.

223
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,050
Why don't you go grab a bite?

224
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,752
I'll be fine.

225
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,357
All right, well, I'll see you
in an hour, okay?

226
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:38,559
Not if I see you first.

227
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,800
I was wondering if I could
ask you guys for a favor.

228
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,736
I really need my laptop
and braille writer,

229
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,471
and I can't ask Melissa
to get them for me.

230
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:52,639
Why not?

231
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,507
Because...

232
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,742
I want you to put this
someplace safe.

233
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,546
It's beautiful.

234
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:04,983
People always say
diamonds are beautiful.

235
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,418
But to me they just feel cold.

236
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:07,919
They have really sharp edges.

237
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:12,190
I guess convincing her to take
a break was a good thing.

238
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,091
Well, the break was her idea.

239
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,394
<i>Melissa's the only girl
I've ever dated.</i>

240
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,362
She wanted me to be sure
before we...

241
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:19,597
took the next step.

242
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,333
Wow.

243
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,634
Yeah.

244
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:31,741
What are you doing?

245
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:32,742
We're here.

246
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,010
We might as well
search the place

247
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,212
<i>in case we're wrong about
periodontitis.</i>

248
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,443
What are you doing?

249
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:44,968
We're here.
Might as well eat.

250
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:47,289
You're stealing food
from a blind man?

251
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:49,858
We're doing him a favor.
He owes me.

252
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:52,994
I take it from your
low self-esteem theory

253
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:58,400
you have some experience
with relationship breaks?

254
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:01,602
What happened?

255
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:06,607
He talked me
in it, then...

256
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:08,810
Slept with three
of my friends.

257
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:10,478
Then dumped my ass.

258
00:13:10,512 --> 00:13:12,480
College boyfriend.

259
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:14,315
Thought he was the love
of my life.

260
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,916
Then why agree to a break?

261
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,653
My self-esteem wasn't
as high back then.

262
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,422
No one's is.

263
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:24,725
Oh!

264
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,792
Sugar free!

265
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:31,246
Ugh. Disgusting.

266
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:34,629
I'll check the bathroom.
You keep checking the snacks,

267
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:00,291
Greg.

268
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:01,793
Sorry I didn't call first.

269
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:04,561
I just flew back
from my conference.

270
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:06,563
Um, this--this
really isn't, uh--

271
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:08,131
I need your medical records

272
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:12,302
and the name of your
primary physician.

273
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:16,573
<i>Well,
you remember Mr. Bell.</i>

274
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:19,075
Well, if I didn't,
I will now.

275
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,713
You're not dying?

276
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:27,417
I, uh...I may have
mislead James

277
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:30,085
by letting him see
a book on cancer.

278
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,186
We did, however,
have some expectations

279
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:33,155
that you might call first.

280
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:35,625
Yeah.

281
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,663
This isn't how I envisioned
you finding out.

282
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:45,199
Mr. Bell and I, we're...

283
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,535
Having sex, got it.

284
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,202
Getting married.

285
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:49,704
Also.

286
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:53,174
We wanted you to be
the first to know.

287
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,480
I need 10 milligrams
of benzodiazepine.

288
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:01,215
Help me hold him down.

289
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,702
I'm putting epilepsy back
on the table.

290
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:14,331
And I'm taking it off
because

291
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:15,466
<i>it doesn't explain
losing his teeth.</i>

292
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,901
<i>The kid's diabetic.</i>

293
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:18,969
The periodontitis could be real
but completely unrelated.

294
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:22,038
Coincidence.
Buying that, House?

295
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:24,540
Until I hear something
that takes my mind off

296
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:28,277
the Jurassic schlong that I was
traumatized by this afternoon.

297
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:30,480
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

298
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,016
Illegal drugs.
Some kind of acid.

299
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,183
His tox screens
were clean.

300
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:37,285
His apartment wasn't.

301
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,088
We didn't find any drugs.

302
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:44,593
Then why am I completely
tripping balls right now?

303
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:48,463
I'm seriously freaking out
here, guys.

304
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:50,531
Can't you tell?

305
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:52,600
You pretty much look the same
as you always do.

306
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:55,169
Take your glasses off.

307
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:02,844
Pupils dilated...

308
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,813
Pulse elevated.
Hallucinating?

309
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:09,883
I think so, because...

310
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,752
He's a rabbit.

311
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:25,831
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

312
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:29,101
Because she's his wife.

313
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:32,705
They flirt a lot.
I've seen things.

314
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:43,048
Mm, Taub--
Taub is either...

315
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:48,720
A tooth fairy or...
Rainbow Brite.

316
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:54,524
And you...

317
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,128
You're just House.

318
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:01,065
She ate ice cream
and Gummi Bears

319
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:02,365
at the patient's apartment.

320
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,735
One of 'em must have
been dosed with it.

321
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,036
Go back and find the drugs.
You two,

322
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:07,437
<i>find out where
he bought them,</i>

323
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:08,739
and then MRI his brain.

324
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:11,107
<i>Check for infections,
masses, and plaques.</i>

325
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:13,743
Am I gonna die?

326
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:16,145
We'll get back to you
on that.

327
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,719
I've been blind since birth.

328
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:24,453
I thought maybe
if I tried LSD,

329
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:29,624
I might, you know...
Colors...a shape.

330
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:31,727
<i>I just--</i>

331
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,595
I just wanted
to see something.

332
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:36,031
How many times?
Maybe five or six.

333
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:37,065
We need to know
where you bought it

334
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,901
so we can find out
what was in it.

335
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:41,936
My girlfriend gave it to me.

336
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,004
I'll find her.
No, don't.

337
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,807
It--it wasn't Melissa.

338
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:48,709
I met someone else.

339
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:54,148
When were you planning
on telling her that,

340
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:56,083
before or after
you ask her to marry you?

341
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,185
The ring isn't for her.

342
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,653
We were on a break.

343
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:03,022
She wanted me to see
what else was out there,

344
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:04,290
and I did.

345
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,692
<i>I was gonna tell her
the other night,</i>

346
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,795
but I ended up here
instead.

347
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:10,830
We just need to talk to the one
who supplied the drugs.

348
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:14,099
She's on vacation
with her parents.

349
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,500
This is her cell.

350
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,269
I don't want her to know
I'm in the hospital.

351
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:19,004
She'll only freak out.

352
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:20,672
That's very considerate
of you.

353
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:24,143
You think this is easy
for me.

354
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:26,011
I know I have to
tell Melissa.

355
00:18:26,045 --> 00:18:27,445
Well, what's stopping you?

356
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,781
<i>She's still one
of my best friends.</i>

357
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:32,383
And I don't want to be
alone in here.

358
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:44,762
Have you seen
your mother yet?

359
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:45,829
<i>She's not dying.</i>

360
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,631
She was having sex
with my father.

361
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:52,635
Ignore her.
She's on acid.

362
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,139
Your father's dead,
House.

363
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:59,242
Not the dead dad,
the biological dad.

364
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:01,544
The one I pointed out to you
at fake father's funeral.

365
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:05,414
Huh.

366
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:06,648
Are you sure?

367
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:09,618
Your only evidence is
that birthmark you saw

368
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:11,687
when you were 12.

369
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:14,190
Well, now I've seen two.

370
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:18,326
Good news is I won't
technically be a bastard

371
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,627
much longer.

372
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:22,197
We're gonna be one big
crappy family.

373
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:27,368
Well, that's--
that's great news.

374
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:29,170
Your mother won't
be alone anymore,

375
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:31,239
and you can finally
get to know the guy.

376
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:33,741
Yes, that is one option.

377
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:37,845
Are you saying you're
not even curious?

378
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:38,946
You want to know
what I think?

379
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,148
I think you know the answer
to that question.

380
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:43,350
You avoid your mother
because she's the one person

381
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,152
whose opinion
you actually care about.

382
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:47,620
If that was true, you'd have
every reason to shut up.

383
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:49,723
I avoid my mother
because she's boring.

384
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:51,523
That's why you've been
so open and honest

385
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:54,227
about prison and marrying
a complete stranger.

386
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,627
Even if I care
what she thinks,

387
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,397
why would I care
what some sperm donor does?

388
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,932
You read the guy's book
about three times.

389
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,133
Years ago.

390
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:05,071
It took three times because
it was so badly written.

391
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,339
Oh, I get it.

392
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,041
The second birthmark
was on his penis, right?

393
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,480
He's a dick.

394
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,048
<i>You've been working
for House for months</i>

395
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,383
and just now realized

396
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,318
that disabled people
can also be dicks?

397
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,920
What he's doing now
to that girl isn't fair.

398
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:24,555
The break was her idea.

399
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,359
And now she thinks
they're back together.

400
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,796
He's a scared, sick, blind kid
who doesn't want to be alone.

401
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,598
You really don't get that?

402
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,502
I do, but...

403
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,870
What is it?

404
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:44,274
Not good news for him...
Or Park.

405
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:53,848
Where's Park?

406
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:56,117
Wilson's babysitting her.

407
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:57,819
Talking about the fact
that she could have

408
00:20:57,853 --> 00:21:01,388
permanent brain damage might
bum her trip out a little bit.

409
00:21:01,423 --> 00:21:04,258
A dark spot doesn't necessarily
equal brain damage.

410
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:06,193
It could be
a congenital malformation

411
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:07,595
connected with his blindness

412
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,063
or a tumor.

413
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:11,197
A clot.
Exactly.

414
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,667
We need to do another scan,
but inject dye and figure out--

415
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:14,668
I said "a clot,"

416
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:16,336
<i>not "or a clot."</i>

417
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,272
It's a clot.

418
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:21,341
Cerebral venous
sinus thrombosis.

419
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,643
<i>Good news for Park.</i>

420
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:24,845
I've never seen one
present this large before.

421
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:26,445
It fits.
When it was smaller,

422
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:28,347
it caused his initial
disorientation

423
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:29,581
and hallucinations.

424
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:31,050
<i>As it grew larger,
the seizures.</i>

425
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:34,219
If left untreated, it leads
to cerebral edema and death.

426
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:35,955
But what causes that
and tooth loss?

427
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:39,692
Any hyper-coagulable state.
Lupus?

428
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:44,428
I counter your lupus
with Behcet's syndrome.

429
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:46,631
No, he doesn't have
any of the earlier symptoms--

430
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,135
color blindness,
abnormal visual fields or--

431
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:57,075
we've been ignoring his eyes
because he's blind.

432
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:02,179
Well, if he wasn't before,
he would be by now.

433
00:22:02,213 --> 00:22:03,446
Confirm with an eye exam,

434
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,582
start treatment with heparin
for the clot.

435
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:09,553
Interferon and steroids
for the Behcet's.

436
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:10,721
No, no!

437
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:13,790
Give me back my teeth!
Park, listen. Park--

438
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:15,191
You're a tooth thief!

439
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:17,459
No, no, no.
Stop it, stop it!

440
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:20,462
Ki-ki-ki!
Back on the couch.

441
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:22,531
What are you doing
to this poor girl?

442
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:25,034
It's not what it looks like.
She--oh!

443
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:29,172
She's tripping on acid.

444
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:30,471
Good lord, man,

445
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:33,308
that's no way
to treat a bad trip.

446
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:34,542
Put the chair down.

447
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:36,678
You'll end up hurting
the poor wee thing.

448
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:39,380
There you are.

449
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:40,749
Hello, darlin'.

450
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:42,350
<i>I'm Thomas,</i>

451
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:44,119
and this beautiful
creature here is Blythe.

452
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:46,187
Is there anything
we can do to help you?

453
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,589
That rabbit
stole my teeth.

454
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:50,725
Of course he did, but I'll
tell you what he's done.

455
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,527
He's put them back again,
and they're twice as nice

456
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:54,528
as they used to be.

457
00:22:54,562 --> 00:22:57,664
You can feel them
if you like.

458
00:23:00,435 --> 00:23:01,735
<i>See?</i>

459
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:04,403
Now, why don't we sit
on this nice comfy couch,

460
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:06,706
have a nice cool drink
and talk all about it.

461
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:10,009
Would you like that?

462
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:14,914
He's had some experience
with things like this,

463
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:16,515
back in the day.

464
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,884
As I recall, both of us--

465
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:21,453
Uh, not the time
or the place, dear.

466
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:25,958
<i>There you are.</i>

467
00:23:25,992 --> 00:23:29,294
See? There you are.

468
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:33,665
There's no way
that guy's related to you.

469
00:23:39,938 --> 00:23:42,339
There's fresh scarring
and swelling in both fundi,

470
00:23:42,374 --> 00:23:44,575
and a bleed on the left.
House was right.

471
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:46,144
It's Behcet's syndrome.

472
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:49,113
Give it to me straight, Doc.

473
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:51,581
Am I ever gonna see again?

474
00:23:51,615 --> 00:23:53,984
That's a little out
of our jurisdiction.

475
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:55,986
We need to wrap a dressing
over your eyes

476
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,387
to keep the light out.

477
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:59,956
Not really a problem
for me.

478
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:01,691
You might not see it,
but your tissue does.

479
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:04,094
It'll also help
with the swelling.

480
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:05,995
I'll leave you in Dr. Adams'
capable hands.

481
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:18,473
You think I'm an ass,
don't you?

482
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:20,542
I can tell
by your breathing.

483
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:25,079
Either you're angry
or fat.

484
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:27,215
I think it's unfair that
you're leading on a woman

485
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,383
who obviously loves
and cares about you.

486
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:31,485
<i>I love and care
about her too.</i>

487
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,956
But we just don't
work together as a couple.

488
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,958
You need to tell her that.

489
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:38,859
<i>I'm going to.</i>

490
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:42,629
But I just want to do it
the right way.

491
00:24:42,663 --> 00:24:44,497
<i>I don't want her
to hate me.</i>

492
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:46,366
When she finds out
you bought an engagement ring

493
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,837
for another woman,
that option is out the window.

494
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:51,538
It was gonna be for her.

495
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:54,307
What changed?

496
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:55,975
<i>She told me we were
going on a break.</i>

497
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:58,277
I didn't even get a say
in the matter.

498
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:01,147
She wanted you to be sure
about your relationship.

499
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:03,382
I can see how that
would be annoying.

500
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:06,953
I think I liked it better when
you were just breathing angrily.

501
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,959
She still sees me
as the same sheltered,

502
00:25:13,993 --> 00:25:16,294
blind geek
she met in college.

503
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:18,496
Most of the time
she acts more like my mother

504
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,498
than my girlfriend.

505
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:21,967
I asked her to marry me.

506
00:25:22,001 --> 00:25:25,403
She tells me I need
to date somebody else first.

507
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:27,338
I'd rather
she just dumped me.

508
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,373
<i>At least that
I can understand.</i>

509
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:31,141
So you were hurt
so much

510
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:33,643
you had to marry
the next woman you met?

511
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:35,846
<i>Julie doesn't see me
as I was,</i>

512
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,548
but for who I am now.

513
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,150
She trusts me to make
my own decisions

514
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:41,951
and to help her with hers.

515
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:44,220
For the first time
in my life,

516
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:47,823
I have somebody
who needs me...

517
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:52,095
Instead of
the other way around.

518
00:25:59,502 --> 00:26:01,203
Ah, she finally
fell asleep.

519
00:26:01,237 --> 00:26:03,171
I think she'll be fine
in a couple of hours.

520
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:06,975
How do you know about
handling a bad acid trip?

521
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,611
Friends in your gardening club
been experimenting again?

522
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:12,180
I was young once.

523
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:20,922
A little scrapbook
that Thomas threw together.

524
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,525
He even has a couple
of pictures of you as a child.

525
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,395
<i>And I've known Greg almost
since he was born, you know.</i>

526
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:29,263
His father and I were
like brothers.

527
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,664
I was a Navy chaplain
in those days.

528
00:26:31,698 --> 00:26:34,000
I left the service
in the late '60s.

529
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:35,535
<i>I don't think his dad
ever forgave me</i>

530
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,737
<i>for protesting the war.</i>

531
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:39,705
Of course, if he knew
I'd got Blythe involved...

532
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,741
You protested the war?
When?

533
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:43,109
You were a child.

534
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,511
I didn't share
my entire schedule with you.

535
00:26:45,546 --> 00:26:47,413
We knew if we told you,
you'd tell him,

536
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:48,580
and he'd kill us both.

537
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:50,782
He was a marine.
It was the ultimate betrayal.

538
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,385
Penultimate.

539
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,055
Sweetheart, I think we need
to get back to the hotel.

540
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:59,524
Wilson, it's been
a real pleasure.

541
00:27:03,795 --> 00:27:07,598
You're right.
Much too formal.

542
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:10,568
Come here, lad.

543
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:13,871
We're practically family now.

544
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:16,774
We'll see you boys tonight.

545
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:18,475
8:00 sharp.

546
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,913
I invited them
out to dinner.

547
00:27:23,948 --> 00:27:25,748
Told them it was
your idea.

548
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:30,920
Straw.

549
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,928
I know we agreed that
whatever happened on break

550
00:27:39,963 --> 00:27:41,763
would stay on break,
and I don't expect you

551
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:43,165
to talk about yours.

552
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,338
But I just want you to know
that there was no one else.

553
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:50,938
I missed you so much,

554
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:55,143
I barely even saw
my own friends.

555
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:57,645
I'm just so glad
it's finally over.

556
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,414
Are you okay?

557
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,619
<i>What's happening
to him?</i>

558
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:18,599
Is he going to be okay?

559
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:22,170
I'm going to need to discuss
that with my colleagues.

560
00:28:23,107 --> 00:28:24,685
We have to talk.

561
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:26,620
No, you need to rest.

562
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:28,288
<i>I have to tell you about...</i>

563
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:30,090
About what happened on break.

564
00:28:30,124 --> 00:28:31,323
<i>Later. You just
lie back and relax--</i>

565
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:33,593
stop it, Melissa!

566
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:36,495
Just stop telling me
what I need,

567
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:40,099
<i>and listen for once,
okay?</i>

568
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:49,941
How are you feeling?

569
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:51,542
Embarrassed.

570
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:53,845
I'm still not sure
what was real

571
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:56,414
or what I hallucinated.

572
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,117
Did you try to kiss me?

573
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:02,853
What about you?

574
00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:04,521
He's stabilized
for the moment.

575
00:29:04,555 --> 00:29:05,789
<i>Coughing up blood.</i>

576
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,257
<i>That doesn't really
change anything.</i>

577
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,359
<i>Hemoptysis is a symptom
of Behcet's.</i>

578
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:11,762
<i>Except our treatment should
make him better, not worse.</i>

579
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:13,030
<i>It could be doing both.</i>

580
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:14,999
Our treatment breaks down
his clot in his head,

581
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:18,168
like it's supposed to,
except a piece broke off

582
00:29:18,202 --> 00:29:20,436
<i>and traveled to one
of his arteries in his lungs.</i>

583
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,106
If anything, we need
to increase the heparin

584
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,774
to prevent further clots
from forming.

585
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:26,342
If we do that
and he starts hemorrhaging,

586
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:27,710
we won't be able
to stop the bleeding.

587
00:29:27,745 --> 00:29:29,045
<i>If we don't do that,
the next clot</i>

588
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:31,881
could cause a heart attack
or a stroke.

589
00:29:31,915 --> 00:29:34,216
Park's way, he at least
has a shot at living.

590
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:38,020
<i>CT his lungs to confirm,
and up the dose.</i>

591
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:46,427
She's young and hot.
She'll bounce back.

592
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:50,831
82 pounds.

593
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:55,636
How much weight I put on when
my break ended the same way.

594
00:29:55,671 --> 00:30:01,475
People were calling me
Park-ing-lot.

595
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:05,813
Hmm...Almost 9:00.

596
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,048
I think your boy
is gonna stand us up.

597
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:10,216
No, no, he'll be here.

598
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,986
<i>Practically walked in
on us having sex.</i>

599
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,821
God, if I saw my mother
doing that,

600
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,223
I'd claw my own eyes out.

601
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:21,427
Of course, she was nowhere
near as attractive as you.

602
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:24,730
Horribly fat,
as a matter of fact.

603
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:25,864
<i>Mother...</i>

604
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:28,366
Guy sleeping
with my mother,

605
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:31,570
this is Dominika, my wife.

606
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:34,940
<i>It's so nice
to be meeting you.</i>

607
00:30:34,974 --> 00:30:39,243
Gregory tells me that you were
born in Richmond, Virginia,

608
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:42,847
and your father was a tailor
who stole from his clients.

609
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:46,117
James has persuaded me
of the value

610
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:48,786
of openness and honesty
in relationships.

611
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:57,227
We see people with disabilities
all the time, but...

612
00:30:57,261 --> 00:31:02,099
Seeing and understanding aren't
always the same thing.

613
00:31:06,637 --> 00:31:09,405
Are you talking to me
or writing a Facebook post?

614
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,006
I'm saying we should have
picked up on the degeneration

615
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,341
in his eyes sooner.

616
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,610
We ignored them
because we assumed

617
00:31:14,644 --> 00:31:16,045
they weren't even part
of the equation.

618
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,215
<i>I also realized,
intellectually,</i>

619
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:22,351
I may understand what it means
to be disabled,

620
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:24,253
but emotionally,
I didn't have a clue.

621
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:27,089
<i>Apparently, his girlfriend
didn't either.</i>

622
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:28,857
So you're back
on his side?

623
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:31,192
It's not a side.
It's a perspective.

624
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:32,994
He just wants to be treated
like an adult,

625
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:34,996
make his own decisions.

626
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,632
I may not agree
with all of them,

627
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:40,802
but how the hell
can I judge him?

628
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:43,704
I'm sure that's exactly
what disabled people want,

629
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:45,873
to be treated like
completely foreign entities,

630
00:31:45,907 --> 00:31:50,711
incapable of being judged
and understood.

631
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:54,448
Park was right
about the clot.

632
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:59,086
Hopefully the anticoagulants
keep it from killing him.

633
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,354
So...She gets the couch

634
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:02,789
on the odd nights,

635
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:04,324
and I get the bed
on evens.

636
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:06,959
<i>In exchange for
a federal felony,</i>

637
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:08,662
<i>she gets a green card,</i>

638
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:10,630
and I get a live-in maid.

639
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,600
Good for you.

640
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:17,670
The immigration policy
in this country is a travesty.

641
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:20,038
It forces people to lie just
so nice people can stay here.

642
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,808
Thank you...Dad.

643
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:30,416
I'm grateful you approve.

644
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,784
You should also know that
I was not in Africa

645
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,018
<i>the last year.</i>

646
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,320
You were in jail.

647
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:39,123
I've been reading
the Princeton police blotter

648
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,059
ever since you moved here.

649
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:50,233
And I'm afraid I haven't
been truthful with you either.

650
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:53,470
And I've wanted to tell you this
for a very long time.

651
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,074
Thomas and I...

652
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:01,378
<i>We got married two months
after your father passed away.</i>

653
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,479
Uh-huh.
You understand,

654
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,548
we didn't want you to think
we were disrespecting

655
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:09,051
the memory of your father.

656
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:12,921
And...Is there
another secret

657
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:14,590
that you want to share
with me?

658
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:19,462
No.

659
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:22,197
There's nothing you think
might be relevant

660
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:24,333
to my life?

661
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,634
Like...What?
I don't know.

662
00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:27,936
Just off the top
of my head,

663
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:31,373
something like I DNA-tested
my dad and found that

664
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:32,941
he was not
my biological father--

665
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:34,376
you are.

666
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,311
That's impossible.

667
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:41,182
People lie.
Birthmarks don't.

668
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:48,256
Oh, my God!

669
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,292
You told me
he was a premie.

670
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:55,028
<i>This bloody lunatic
is my son!</i>

671
00:33:55,062 --> 00:33:56,462
He's not a lunatic.

672
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:57,931
All those years
you could have told me.

673
00:33:57,965 --> 00:33:59,199
I could have done things.

674
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,634
That could have made
a difference in the boy's life.

675
00:34:01,668 --> 00:34:03,336
I think we should all
just calm down.

676
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:04,604
Look at him sitting there--

677
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:06,539
a pill-popping sociopath!

678
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:08,307
If you wanted
to screw up his life,

679
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:09,942
you couldn't have
done it better.

680
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:11,143
He's got you there, mom.

681
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:13,245
He's one of the most
well-respected doctors

682
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,546
in the world.

683
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,317
He's saved more lives
than you can count.

684
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:21,253
Now, you apologize to him,
or I swear,

685
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:23,722
you will never
see me again, Thomas.

686
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:26,157
I can't deal with this
anymore.

687
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:27,992
<i>He's my son?</i>

688
00:34:28,027 --> 00:34:30,028
I'm having a bloody breath
of fresh air,

689
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:33,164
that's what I'm doing.

690
00:34:38,337 --> 00:34:41,204
So, who's for dessert?

691
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:48,478
Somebody help me!

692
00:34:48,512 --> 00:34:49,879
Uhh! Somebody--

693
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:52,749
Will? It's Dr. Adams
and Dr. Chase.

694
00:34:52,783 --> 00:34:55,252
We just need to know--
My eyes! My eyes!

695
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:57,920
It feels like
it's on fire!

696
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:09,153
It's not behcet's.

697
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:10,487
It doesn't necrotize tissue
like this.

698
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,778
I think it's
streptococcus pyogenes.

699
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:14,280
Except we've already
treated him

700
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:16,014
with broad spectrum
antibiotics.

701
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:18,284
It shouldn't be spreading.
It should be dying.

702
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:20,353
Just means
it's drug-resistant.

703
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:22,020
We need to remove
what's left of his eyes

704
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:23,522
before
the gangrene sets in.

705
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:25,658
It's something that looks
and acts like a bacteria

706
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,092
but isn't one.

707
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,093
Could be viral.
No, it couldn't.

708
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,362
There's no evidence
of viral markers

709
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:32,631
in the necrotized tissue.

710
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,067
Let me see that image
you took last night

711
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:37,502
of the clot in his lung.

712
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,481
That's not a piece of the clot
from his brain.

713
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:54,184
That's the point
of infection.

714
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,387
Mucormycosis.

715
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,821
<i>He breathed in the spores,</i>

716
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,390
it's been growing
and spreading ever since.

717
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,991
A fungal infection
spreading this fast?

718
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:03,293
<i>Kid's a diabetic.</i>

719
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,794
He already has
a compromised immune system.

720
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:06,962
He's right.
This sample from his eyes

721
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:08,030
is crawling with it.

722
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,866
Treat with amphotericin b.

723
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:12,468
We treated him
with gentamicin

724
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,836
when we thought
it was bacterial,

725
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,138
<i>which means the dose
of amphotericin b we'll need</i>

726
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:19,007
to cure him will probably
leave him deaf.

727
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:21,743
Sorry, I stopped listening
after you said

728
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:24,646
<i>"the dose we'll need
to cure him."</i>

729
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:37,358
Blind and deaf?

730
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:40,928
I'd rather be dead.

731
00:36:40,962 --> 00:36:42,196
You will be.

732
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:47,267
I can live with that.

733
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:53,673
You never did get
my humor.

734
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,212
There's a chance your hearing
won't be completely gone.

735
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:05,684
How much of a chance?

736
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,087
A small one.

737
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:10,923
<i>But a chance.</i>

738
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,566
I'm--I'm refusing treatment.

739
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:29,474
You don't know how hard
things are already for me.

740
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:32,944
I can't handle any more.

741
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:39,616
I can't.

742
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:46,156
Oh, hi.

743
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:48,825
I'm here to apologize.

744
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,828
<i>I could have handled
the news with more...</i>

745
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:56,499
Aplomb?

746
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:59,235
I have a son.
That's great news.

747
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,805
What else did she
tell you to say?

748
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,242
You're not a lunatic,
you're not a mistake.

749
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:13,648
<i>I never liked your friend...
My father.</i>

750
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:17,219
Well, he could be
a bit intense at times.

751
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,488
But unlike you,
I did respect him.

752
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:25,092
Do you respect your mother?

753
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:31,132
Well, we do have that
in common.

754
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:34,201
And we all love her.

755
00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:36,637
So we don't have
much choice, do we?

756
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:44,110
Son, see you
at dinner.

757
00:39:00,393 --> 00:39:02,928
Will, it's me.

758
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:07,333
Let me guess.

759
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:09,034
The doctor who thinks
I'm an ass

760
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:11,636
wants you to convince me
to live.

761
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:14,072
Yes.

762
00:39:19,278 --> 00:39:22,913
It won't work.
I know.

763
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:28,252
So I won't.

764
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:32,189
Wow.
You're that angry?

765
00:39:32,223 --> 00:39:37,827
I've made enough decisions
for you.

766
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:40,497
This is your life.

767
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,868
Why'd you come back?

768
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:52,108
Because I love you.

769
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:55,711
And I want to be with you
for as long as I can.

770
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:01,383
Melissa, I'm so scared.

771
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:04,952
Me too.

772
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,760
I'll always love you.

773
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:20,534
Even if I was deaf?

774
00:40:20,568 --> 00:40:23,970
Even if anything.

775
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:43,122
Is it working?

776
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:45,425
He's still very ill,

777
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,893
but if he keeps responding
the way he has been,

778
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:51,163
he should be fine.

779
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:54,566
And his hearing?
It's gone.

780
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,835
<i>We don't know yet
if it'll be permanent.</i>

781
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:09,280
Melissa?
Is that you?

782
00:41:09,314 --> 00:41:10,281
We've been squeezing
his hand,

783
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:12,116
once for yes,
twice for no.

784
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,558
Can I ask you something?

785
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:24,294
I completely understand
if you squeeze no.

786
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,103
Will you marry me?

787
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:44,813
Don't leave me hanging,
now.

788
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:47,116
Yes.

789
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,184
Yes! Of course, yes!

790
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:52,988
I--I heard that.
You said yes, right?

791
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:56,090
Yes!
You said y--

792
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:08,302
How long are you gonna wait
until you tell me?

793
00:42:08,337 --> 00:42:10,703
I thought we already had
the Santa Claus talk.

794
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:14,574
You don't think
I saw you steal Thomas' fork

795
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:16,676
from the restaurant?
Why would I do that?

796
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,844
For his DNA.

797
00:42:17,878 --> 00:42:23,216
That's...That's...

798
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:25,651
Very observant of you.

799
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:27,819
See, you're more me
than you pretend.

800
00:42:27,854 --> 00:42:30,189
You had to know for sure.

801
00:42:30,223 --> 00:42:33,725
So you needed proof.

802
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,594
The fact that
you haven't told me

803
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:39,632
can only mean...

804
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:41,699
He isn't your father either.

805
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:51,108
I'm sorry.

806
00:42:54,513 --> 00:42:55,846
You know what that means.

807
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:57,681
Your mom's a slut.

808
00:42:57,715 --> 00:43:00,717
That...

809
00:43:00,751 --> 00:43:05,917
And...she's not as boring
as I thought she was.
