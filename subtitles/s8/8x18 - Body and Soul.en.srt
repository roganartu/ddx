Okay, honey.

Calm down.
It's all right.

You're just having
another bad dream.

Yes, you can.

00:01:05,527 --> 00:01:07,495
You're fine.
Just relax.

12
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:10,248
Just take slow,
deep breaths.

13
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,416
Nice and easy.

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,218
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

I'm...trying...
But I can't!

16
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:18,723
Relax.

17

If the nightmare's
scary enough,

60
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:41,449

An ancient demon

I think that qualifies.

65
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:49,657
Except in the rational
part of the file,

66
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,160
where it says his EKG's

67

<i>It's not his heart.</i>

What about obstructive
sleep apnea?

69
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,798
Sleep apnea wouldn't
have caused breathing problems

70
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:57,749

71
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,467
What did you dream of?

72
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:01,719
I never remember
my dreams.

73
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:04,389
But you're certain
that they're insignificant.

74
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:05,840
Defensively so.

75
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,375
I was defending science.

76
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,377
You were defensively
defending science.

77
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:10,929
Lung damage
from inhaled toxins

78
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:12,847
could keep causing problems
after he woke up.

79
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:14,866
Or an upper respiratory
infection.

80
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:17,318
Okay, Chase and Park,

81
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:19,554
start iv antibiotics
for pneumonia.

82
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,239
Taub and Adams,
go check the home for toxins.

83
00:04:21,323 --> 00:04:23,575
Could I go with Taub?

84
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,493
It was my idea.

85
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,329
Right...
'cause for a moment there,

86
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:29,998
I thought you were
uncomfortable around Chase

87
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:33,118
because you'd had
a nocturnal Australian.

88
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:38,289
You can go with
whoever you want.

89
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:41,709
But all of you,
read all of these files.

90
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:52,854
Do you believe a spirit
could be hurting your son?

91
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:54,522
No, of course not.

92
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,608
Because if he's been taught
to believe that,

93
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,293
it is possible
for the fear alone

94
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,394
to affect heart function.

95
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:00,862
I'm an engineer.

96
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:03,531
I know illnesses aren't
caused by evil spirits.

97
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:04,949
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to,

98
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:07,368
I just...
had to check.

99
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:09,787
Anything else
you need to check?

100
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:12,740
No.

101
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:23,668
I had a dream.

102
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:25,170
House...

103
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:27,639
We can talk later.

104
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:29,841
Relax, I'm a Doctor.

105
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:32,126
Your spectacular breasts
mean nothing to me.

106
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:33,261
House...

107
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:35,813
House!

108
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:43,137
Later.

109
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,656
I had sex with Dominika.

110
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,574
In a dream?

111
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:49,327
It wasn't literally sex.

112
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,646
Technically,
it was flossing.

113
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:53,364
You know,
teeth, testicles.

114
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,583
I think the symbolism
is pretty clear.

115
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:59,087
"Later" just changed
to "never."

116
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:05,960
I'll tell you
what would be weirder,

117
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:08,596
if you <i>didn't</i> dream about
having sex with Chase.

118
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:09,931
Have you?

119
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:11,766
No.

120
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,218
But I've dreamed
about having sex

121
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:14,636
with a lot of people
I work with,

122
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:15,836
and it didn't
freak me out.

123
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,338
That's different.

124
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,673
How?

125
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:20,275
'Cause you've
actually had sex

126
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:21,359
with a lot of people
at work,

127
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:23,844
and that hasn't
freaked you out.

128
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:25,530
Good point.

129
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:29,016
So you're worried
about what it means?

130
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:32,153
I'm not worried.
It means nothing.

131
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:35,707
It means something,
doesn't it?

132
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,125
I work with him.

133
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:39,627
I can't want
to sleep with him.

134
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:41,529
Maybe Chase
just represents work.

135
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,133
You're just falling in love
with your job.

136
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,535
It has been
very satisfying lately.

137
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:49,270
You smell that?

138
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:52,640
Yeah.
Smells like wet dog.

139
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:55,927
It's mold.

140
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:58,763
It's not mold.
It's definitely mold.

141
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:16,948
I don't see
any sign of water damage.

142

<i>Holy crap.</i>

143
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,917

I don't know what
you're talking about.

145
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:40,387
It was clean

146
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:42,389
You're telling us
some random person

147
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,641
broke into your house
to dismember a pig

148
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:45,942
in your son's bedroom?

149
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:47,694
A pig?

150
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:50,596
My father-in-law.

151
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:56,369
What did you do?

152
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:58,054
What you should have
done weeks ago,

153
00:07:58,122 --> 00:07:59,239
<i>when the dreams started.</i>

154
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,657
I'm saving Lue.

155
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:01,791
<i>He's coding!</i>

156
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:05,962
<i>Need a Doctor in here!</i>

157
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:08,048
V-tach.
No pulse.

158
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:09,883
Oh, my God!
Push 1 milligram EPI!

159
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,802
Paddles. Charge to 50.
Charging!

160
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:14,838
Clear!

161
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,457
Baby...

162
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:18,458
Still V-tach!

163
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:20,677
Charge to 100!

164
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:21,728
100!

165
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:24,431
Clear!

166
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:25,482
Charge--
wait!

167
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:26,566
Normal sinus rhythm.

168
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:35,025
Oh, God!

169
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:36,409
He's stable,

170
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:38,111
but we've obviously
got a second symptom.

171
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:39,579
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
kid in V-tach.

172
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,247
Tell me about the luau
in his bedroom.

173
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:42,916
It's a traditional
Hmong ceremony

174
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:44,751
that's supposed to call back
the kid's soul.

175
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:46,987
Hasn't he heard of star-69?
<i>There's more.</i>

176
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:48,888
The reason grandpa thinks
the kid's soul is stolen

177
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:51,257
is because he's convinced
his son, the kid's father,

178
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:52,425
<i>had his stolen as well.</i>

179
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:54,928
He beat his boss
to death.

180
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:55,845
The dad
didn't move away.

181
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:57,330
He's in prison.

182
00:08:57,381 --> 00:08:59,999
PTSD could definitely
cause breathing problems--

183
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:01,301
It's not PTSD.

184
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,636
Even if the kid
wasn't there,

185
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:05,021
just hearing
what the dad did--

186
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:06,056
But he hasn't.

187
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,557
It happened
when he was two,

188
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:08,892
and all he's ever
been told is that

189
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:10,226
his parents divorced

190
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:12,062
and his dad moved away.

191
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:13,697
The heart thing indicates
a malignant arrhythmia.

192
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:14,898
<i>He needs an E.P. study.</i>

193
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:16,016
How many
of the other files

194
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,684
showed malignant
arrhythmias?

195
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:18,735
None, but--

196
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:19,852
Forget the E.P.

197
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:21,187
What about
acute pericarditis?

198
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:22,455
<i>Explains the dyspnea.</i>

199
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:23,573
How many
of the other files--

200
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:25,325
<i>it's exacerbated</i>
<i>by lying supine,</i>

201
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:26,793
so the symptoms
would get worse

202
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,961
when he goes to sleep.

203
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:31,748
Just like all 100
of the others.

204
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,501
Do an echo to check
the pericardium.

205
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:36,553
See if you can find
any cardioactive toxins

206
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:39,422
in the home samples.

207
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:44,577
Can I just say that I
very much enjoy my job?

208
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,069
<i>No, no, please.</i>

209
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:57,273
No need to apologize
for your earlier behavior.

210
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:59,209
<i>Floss was mint</i>

211
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:01,611
probably because of
this green G-string

212
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:03,496
she hangs up to dry
in the bathroom.

213
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,331
My watch
must have stopped.

214
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,367
Apparently
it's already "never."

215
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:08,418
You might want to
forward your calls.

216
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:09,753
You do not want

217
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,204
the <i>Reader's Digest</i>
version on this.

218
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:14,624
There was a very tight
hygienist's uniform,

219
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,377
suggestive use
of the water sprayer--

220
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:19,212
The floss isn't sex.
It's guilt.

221
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,097
<i>It's tying you up</i>
<i>for throwing away</i>

222
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:22,415
<i>the I.N.S. notification</i>

223
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:25,185
granting Dominika
her citizenship.

224
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:27,971
She can move out,
but she still doesn't know it,

225
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:30,774
which means you're basically
holding her prisoner.

226
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:32,258
<i>Tell her the truth,</i>

227
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:35,428
and leave me alone.

228
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,609
Really?
What?

229
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:52,495
You startled me.

230
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,114
We work together
every day,

231
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,000
usually under
a fair amount of stress.

232
00:10:57,084 --> 00:10:58,334
It's only natural
I'd pop into

233
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:02,956
a subconscious thought
every once in a while.

234
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:05,341
Have you ever dreamt
about having sex with me?

235
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,143
No.

236
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:08,428
You paused.

237
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:11,764
No, I didn't.
You think I'm lying?

238
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:13,683
No, I think you're
fighting the urge

239
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,902
to snap the word "no"
because your subconscious

240
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:18,972
finds the idea abhorrent.

241
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,327
So if I snap,
it's offensive,

242
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:25,811
and if I don't snap,
it's offensive

243
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:26,946
for the exact
same reason?

244
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:29,148
Talk to your
subconscious.

245
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,334
This is becoming weird
because you're making it weird.

246
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:33,920
So you don't find
the idea abhorrent?

247
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,088
I work with you.

248
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:36,172
I don't have to answer
that question.

249
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:40,260
You just did.

250
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,262
What happened?

251
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:45,965
Echo was negative,

252
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:47,967
but he has severe
abdominal pain.

253
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:50,503
Ultrasound didn't suggest
any intestinal blockages,

254
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:53,189
but he's severely
constipated.

255
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:54,674
No spores, clostridium,
or organic toxins

256
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:56,943
in the kitchen samples.
Nothing in the bedroom either.

257
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,444
We need to scope him,
and we're gonna need

258
00:11:58,512 --> 00:11:59,612
to clear his bowel first.

259
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,180
We should biopsy
his thyroid.

260
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,032
For an impacted bowel?

261
00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:04,984
Hashimoto's thyroiditis
would explain

262
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:07,186
his lung, heart,
and intestinal involvement.

263
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,489
And if you think we still
need house's approval,

264
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,543
it also explains
dying in your sleep.

265
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:19,799
Nice call.

266
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,554
When you invite me
for dinner,

267
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:26,038
I thought maybe you
take me to a restaurant.

268
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,974
Or have plates.

269
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:30,260
Yeah, sorry.

270
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:31,728
Idiot delivery guy
forgot them.

271
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:33,479
Mm...the idiot
delivery guy,

272
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:34,714
or the idiot guy
whose food you stole

273
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:37,684
from lounge
refrigerator, huh?

274
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:39,485
You've gotten to know me
pretty well.

275
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:43,723
My citizenship
depends on it, right?

276
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:45,942
Yeah...

277
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,694
that's actually why
I wanted to talk to you.

278
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:48,695
You heard news?

279
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:52,282
Yeah.

280
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,866
So what news?

281
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:58,204
They want us to come in
for another interview?

282
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:01,274
No.

283
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,295
Since we hadn't
heard anything,

284
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,015
I--I called,
and they said

285
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:11,384
it's gonna be
a couple weeks,

286
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:13,620
maybe a month
till they finalize

287
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,438
their decision.

288
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:16,472
A month?

289
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:20,610
Yeah, I know.
It sucks.

290
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:25,148
No, it's--it's not suck
to live with you.

291
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:27,116
It's been fun, but...

292
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:31,270
you know, I just
want to be legal.

293
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,938
And you will be.

294
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,743
Absolutely.

295
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:38,661
In the meantime...
Hmm?

296
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:41,614
You ever shot anyone?

297
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:46,970
No, get away.

298
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,504
Look, this needle

299
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,223
isn't nearly as big
as the one in your arm,

300
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,557
and that didn't hurt,
did it?

301
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,659
I don't want it.

302
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:53,626
They need
to do it, Lue.

303
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:55,261
You'll only feel

304
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:56,512
a little pinch
as we give you

305
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:57,647
the numbing medicine,
and after that,

306
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:58,815
you won't feel a thing.

307
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,850
No!

308
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:02,101
Lue, calm down.
It's gonna be okay.

309
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,690
What's he saying?

310
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,776
What's the problem?
I don't know.

311
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:11,527
He's saying
it's too late.

312
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:13,746
There's nothing
we can do.

313
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:14,947
It's Hmong.

314
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,866
He doesn't speak Hmong.

315
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,317
<i>He's never even</i>
<i>heard it.</i>

316
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:19,452
<i>It isn't him speaking.</i>

317
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:21,487
It's the Dab.

318
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:22,955
He's seizing!

319
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:24,374
Oh--!
Oh, my God!

320
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,010
Need some
Lorazepam in here!

321
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,400
Seizure
rules out Hashimoto's.

322
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:37,452
Yeah,
that's the issue,

323
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:39,454
not that we have
no rational explanation

324
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:40,805
<i>for how the patient</i>
<i>spoke a language</i>

325
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:41,706
<i>he's never even heard.</i>

326
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:42,707
I've got one.

327
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:50,265
It means "you're a bunch
of pathetic idiots" in Hmong.

328
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,916
Or it doesn't.

329
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,719
But you wouldn't know because
none of you speak Hmong.

330
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,920
Kid, on the other hand,

331
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:57,772
is presumably fluent
in gibberish.

332
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,190
The grandfather
speaks Hmong.

333
00:14:59,258 --> 00:15:00,391
He translated.

334
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,910
He heard what
he wanted to hear,

335
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:03,811
'cause if his grandson
really is possessed,

336
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,429
that means his son
really is possessed,

337
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:07,065
which is a giant step up
from being

338
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,816
a sledgehammering
psychopath.

339
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,468
Whatever it was
preceded a seizure.

340
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,819
It's obviously
a neurological symptom.

341
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,538
Scleroderma,
advanced to the point

342
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:16,440
that it's affecting
his brain?

343
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:17,458
Interesting.

344
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:18,576
So we should
start treating--

345
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:19,827
Interesting
that you keep

346
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:22,580
falling for it
when I say "interesting."

347
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:23,631
The scleroderma part
was idiotic--

348
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:24,966
we'd have seen
skin involvement.

349
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,385
The interesting part is
that you and Park agree,

350
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:30,221
but you're not able
to look at each other.

351
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,642
Um...
I'm looking at her.

352
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:36,261
I'm looking at him.

353
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:40,631
Good,
now lick your lips.

354
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:42,951
Rasmussen's encephalitis.

355
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:44,185
Diffuse spotty
inflammation

356
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,770
could hit the autonomic
centers of the brain.

357
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:54,829
It's Hmong for
"get an MRI to confirm."

358
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:01,786
Rasmussen's encephalitis.

359
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,504
But he'll be okay?

360
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,174
With treatment,
it's manageable.

361
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,826
And it explains
all the things

362
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:09,677
that have
happened to him?

363
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,329
We think so.

364
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,547
You are wrong.

365
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,682
And you are wasting
my grandson's time.

366
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,517
Neurological issues
can cause a person

367
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,720
to speak in tongues,
speak with an accent--

368
00:16:18,804 --> 00:16:20,355
He wasn't
speaking in tongues!

369
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:21,689
In times of stress,

370
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:23,641
our senses can fool us
into believing--

371
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,644
I know the difference
between science and faith,

372
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,846
and when my son started
having the same dreams

373
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:33,067
my grandson is having,
science couldn't help him.

374
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:35,653
I'm sorry if your son
suffered from mental illness.

375
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,290
Kao was not crazy.

376
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:42,577
He was bright,
caring, happy,

377
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:44,829
until the bad dreams came.

378
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,466
I don't want to watch it
happen again.

379
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,553
Please don't
scare the boy.

380
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:56,424
It won't help him
get better.

381
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:10,221
<i>Axial view of mid-brain</i>
<i>level looks good.</i>

382
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:12,790
Moving on to thalamic.

383
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:15,126
I had another dream
last night.

384
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:17,245
This time
it was about you.

385
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,996
Really?

386
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:21,165
See, that's how
you're supposed to react.

387
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,084
When a woman tells you
she's dreamt about you,

388
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,420
you should be thrilled,

389
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:27,455
even if you're not interested
in her whatsoever.

390
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:28,856
You're an idiot,
you know that?

391
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,875
Well, I definitely won't be
dreaming about you tonight.

392
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,143
I'm jealous
of you two.

393
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,778
<i>You couldn't be</i>
<i>more different,</i>

394
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:35,263
<i>and yet you have</i>
<i>this good thing happening.</i>

395
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,716
You support each other.
You like each other.

396
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:41,552
Don't let House
screw it up.

397
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,088
We're not
<i>that</i> different.

398
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:47,291
Yeah, you are.

399
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:08,129
Apparently, there are
some things about you

400
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,163
I don't know.

401
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:11,549
I served one year
in police unit.

402
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:14,218
And you're just telling
your husband now?

403
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:15,803
Immigration
doesn't know.

404
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,255
No need
for husband to know.

405
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,393
What is happening
to boy with demons?

406
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:25,596
Absence of evidence
on an MRI,

407
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:29,684
which my team has mistaken
for evidence of absence.

408
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,490
This is what
I am not understanding:

409
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,191
How can you believe
in dark matters

410
00:18:37,276 --> 00:18:38,910
but not in
dark spirits?

411
00:18:38,977 --> 00:18:41,863
Is--is the idea
of demons

412
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:44,081
so different than
the higgs boson?

413
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:45,500
We can't see it,
but we can see

414
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:49,420
the impact
of its presence.

415
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:52,356
I borrowed
your physics book.

416
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,493
I read while in bathroom.

417
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:56,761
You're a dead-eye shot

418
00:18:56,828 --> 00:18:58,329
and enjoy reading
quantum physics

419
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,430
on the crapper?

420
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,466
I read in bathtub.

421
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,168
Better image.

422
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:07,104
Thank you.

423
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:18,065
The doctors say
my brain is sick.

424
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,017
Your doctors
are trying their best,

425
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:22,353
but they're not looking
in the right place.

426
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:25,223
You know, I know
this is a lot

427
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,358
to put on
an eight-year-old,

428
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,260
but you have angered
our ancestors

429
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:31,295
by ignoring them.

430
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:35,082
Now do you remember
how to talk to them?

431
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,202
Yeah, that's right.

432
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:39,203
Good.

433
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:41,088
Now close your eyes,

434
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:45,943
and we will ask
for forgiveness together.

435
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:51,382
You're doing good...

436
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,418
But we have to do more.

437
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,554
The evil spirits
are in the air,

438
00:19:56,622 --> 00:19:58,356
and the only way
to stop them

439
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:03,294
is by stopping the air.

440
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:21,045
You have to be brave.
I'm not trying to hurt you.

441
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:24,515
This will help you.

442
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,436
I know it will.

443
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:34,225
<i>Lue?</i>

444
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,726
You okay?

445
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,278
I can't wake him up!

446
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,262
Lue!

447
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:40,231
Lue, you're safe.

448
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,566
You're in the hospital.

449
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,651
Get grandpa away!

450
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:45,786
He's not here, honey.
It was just a dream.

451
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,288
He was choking me!

452
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,789
No, Lue,
it wasn't real.

453
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,792
It was!
He grabbed my neck!

454
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:59,250
Those bruises
weren't there before.

455
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,568
He had the dream,
and then he had the bruising.

456
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,770
<i>More likely--</i>

457
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:09,822
and by "likely,"
I mean "rationally"--

458
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:11,240
it's the other
way around.

459
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,042
His brain felt
the pain in his neck

460
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:16,162
and created the dream
to explain it.

461
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:17,380
Coagulopathy.

462
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:19,832
Lung problems cause
a clotting disturbance.

463
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,334
He would have
bruises everywhere.

464
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:23,419
Is it really
preposterous

465
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,171
that dreams can have
physical manifestations?

466
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:27,957
Well,
short answer is--

467
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:29,976
Thoughts during sleep

468
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,261
can and do cause
physical changes.

469
00:21:32,312 --> 00:21:33,512
Is that right,
Dr. Park?

470
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:35,264
<i>Did you wake up</i>
<i>this morning</i>

471
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:37,984
experiencing
physical changes?

472
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:39,402
It's medically relevant.

473
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:40,820
Her dream
doesn't mean anything.

474
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:42,772
Can we start acting like
it doesn't mean anything?

475
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:43,940
<i>Sure.</i>

476
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:44,974
We could also start
acting like walls

477
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:46,108
don't mean anything,

478
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,526
but then we'd
hurt our noses.

479
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:49,245
<i>You've been taking</i>
<i>the high road.</i>

480
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:51,647
You haven't been teasing in
an obviously teasable situation

481
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:53,315
because you know
it does mean something.

482
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:55,084
<i>She hates the dream</i>
<i>because it makes her</i>

483
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:56,168
feel vulnerable.

484
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:57,370
You love the dream
because it makes you

485
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:59,705
feel superior.

486
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,957
<i>The poor lass</i>
<i>who can't help</i>

487
00:22:01,008 --> 00:22:02,758
<i>but fall sway</i>
<i>to your charms,</i>

488
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:04,176
<i>and you're</i>
<i>bestowing upon her</i>

489
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:05,511
the gift of
illusory irrelevance.

490
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:07,663
Can you please
hint to House

491
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:08,931
that you
had a sex dream?

492
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,667
I'd really prefer
not to get distracted

493
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:13,436
with trying to cure
the patient today.

494
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:15,137
I refuse to divulge
my dreams

495
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:16,856
about girl-on-girl
loofa action.

496
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,442
<i>The bruising</i>
<i>could indicate anemia,</i>

497
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:22,478
<i>a vitamin C deficiency,</i>
<i>or even leukemia.</i>

498
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:24,563
That is so weird
that you and I

499
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:25,848
had the same dream.

500
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,850
<i>I assume yours also ends</i>

501
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:30,369
with me achieving ecstasy
while simultaneously

502
00:22:30,454 --> 00:22:32,455
placing third in
the New York City marathon.

503
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:33,539
Third?

504
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:36,459
I'm a realist.

505
00:22:36,526 --> 00:22:39,862
Liver failure can cause
gibberish from encephalopathy,

506
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:42,832
constipation, bruising,
and breathing problems.

507
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:45,167
Hepatic fibrosis
could hit someone his age.

508
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:48,037
So let's hit his liver.

509
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:50,973
Get a biopsy.

510
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:55,478
Angle a bit
more superiorly.

511
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:00,983
<i>He keeps having</i>
<i>these nightmares</i>

512
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:05,771
that become real.
They really hurt him.

513
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:07,523
I don't want to believe
that a nightmare

514
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:08,891
can do that, but I--

515
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:10,993
I'm struggling
with it too,

516
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:13,729
but these things can be
explained medically.

517
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,433
But you haven't.

518
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:18,434
Every Doctor,

519
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:20,252
<i>every idea they've had,</i>

520
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:23,172
it's been wrong.

521
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:32,348
Liver biopsy's back.
Team's about to meet.

522
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:36,585
Back to avoiding
eye contact with me?

523
00:23:36,636 --> 00:23:38,104
House got to you again?

524
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,923
Want me to gaze
longingly into your eyes

525
00:23:40,974 --> 00:23:43,976
as I tell you
the test results?

526
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:47,530
I want you to treat me
like a friend,

527
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:48,981
which means
getting over the fact

528
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,983
that you like me
more than I like you.

529
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:54,487
Yeah, egotism and preening
really turn me on.

530
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:58,157
Too bad I'm not attracted
to androgyny and self-pity,

531
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,441
or you'd have it made.

532
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,544
Because anyone
who hasn't gotten wet

533
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,445
from your petri dish
of STDs

534
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:06,715
clearly has
low self-esteem!

535
00:24:06,783 --> 00:24:07,750
Bitch.

536
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:11,337
Dick!

537
00:24:26,153 --> 00:24:28,571
You coming?

538
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:30,689
Why didn't your lips move
when you said that?

539
00:24:30,774 --> 00:24:31,674
<i>Chase!</i>

540
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:35,111
You coming?

541
00:24:35,178 --> 00:24:37,997
Liver biopsy's back.

542
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:44,003
I'll be right there.

543
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,842
Biopsy was negative
for fibrosis.

544
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:51,177
So once again,

545
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:52,511
you don't know
what's wrong?

546
00:24:52,596 --> 00:24:55,214
It's always good
to rule out the bad things.

547
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:58,100
<i>Doctors!</i>

548
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:05,391
God!

549
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:18,888
Was he?

550
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:21,790
Yes.

551
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:28,319
He was levitating.
Cool.

552
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:30,491
So the one thing
we know for sure

553
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:32,693
is he was not
levitating.

554
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:34,361
He was floating

555
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:36,080
6 inches off the bed.

556
00:25:36,164 --> 00:25:38,916
He could've just been arching
his back off the bed.

557
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,667
Yes, but then I would have
come into the room

558
00:25:40,718 --> 00:25:42,836
and reported
that the patient

559
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:45,038
was weirdly arching
his back off the bed.

560
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,342
It was his whole body.
He was levitating.

561
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:50,677
So many questions...

562
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:53,730
Starting with why did Chase
address his comment

563
00:25:53,815 --> 00:25:57,551
to someone who wasn't
even in the room?

564
00:25:57,602 --> 00:26:00,404
Hocus pocus,

565
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:04,291
on my feet
you idiots must focus.

566
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:15,569
The kid's
not a magician.

567
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,088
Of course not.
He's the lovely assistant.

568
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:20,924
'Cause grandpa pig sticker
is waving the wand.

569
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:23,877
Middling with...

570
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:25,629
is Chase trying
to avoid Taub,

571
00:26:25,713 --> 00:26:27,247
or is he trying
to prove

572
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:28,465
that he's not
avoiding Park?

573
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,633
<i>We checked the bed.</i>

574
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:31,635
There were no platforms
or wires.

575
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:32,803
This wasn't a trick.

576
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:34,888
Tetanus could cause
muscle rigidity.

577
00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:37,107
<i>Maybe he was propped up</i>
<i>by his heel and elbow.</i>

578
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:38,108
Except he wasn't!

579
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:39,159
<i>Tetanus wouldn't cause</i>

580
00:26:39,227 --> 00:26:41,895
that kind of
breathing difficulty.

581
00:26:41,946 --> 00:26:43,030
And ending with...

582
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:44,698
if Chase is trying
not to avoid Park,

583
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:47,434
why is he doing this
today and not yesterday?

584
00:26:47,502 --> 00:26:49,953
But hypocalcemia could,

585
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:51,071
<i>and the enema</i>
<i>we administered</i>

586
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:52,122
<i>to cure</i>
<i>his constipation</i>

587
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:53,657
<i>had a high</i>
<i>phosphorous load,</i>

588
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:56,276
which could make him
transiently hypocalcemic.

589
00:26:56,344 --> 00:26:58,945
It's a long shot,
but at least

590
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:00,747
it has the benefit
of being rational.

591
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:02,299
Go pump up
his electrolytes

592
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:05,335
and start
beta-blockers.

593
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,222
And good news
for Park:

594
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:12,392
I think Chase
had a sex dream about you.

595
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,330
Dreams don't
mean anything.

596
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:18,599
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Nothing you've done has helped.</i>

597
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,967
If we don't start
and he has another seizure,

598
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,855
the neurological damage
could be permanent.

599
00:27:24,939 --> 00:27:27,107
My father-in-law--

600
00:27:27,158 --> 00:27:28,442
he thinks
the calling ceremony

601
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:30,077
didn't work because Lue
wasn't there.

602
00:27:30,144 --> 00:27:33,647
And you think
he's right?

603
00:27:33,698 --> 00:27:34,915
I don't know.

604
00:27:34,982 --> 00:27:36,917
I'm sorry,
but there's no way

605
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:38,619
we can allow him
to perform an exorcism

606
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,371
in your son's
hospital room.

607
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:44,958
Then I will have
to take him home.

608
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:46,226
A day ago,
you were insulted

609
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:47,828
I'd even think you might
believe that stuff,

610
00:27:47,896 --> 00:27:49,730
<i>and now you're willing</i>
<i>to stop all treatment,</i>

611
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:51,998
<i>so you can try it?</i>

612
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,502
Maybe Xang
was right about Kao.

613
00:27:55,553 --> 00:27:57,337
The man I loved
wasn't evil

614
00:27:57,388 --> 00:28:00,274
and would never do
what he did.

615
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:08,181
He was...possessed.

616
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:15,088
And my son needs
his soul back.

617
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,657
Why not?

618
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,375
<i>As long as he doesn't</i>
<i>feed the kid anything</i>

619
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,410
or put anything on his skin
that we haven't

620
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:21,828
verified is harmless,
what's the problem?

621
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,247
I agree.

622
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:24,965
And since we're
establishing a new policy

623
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:26,383
of "What the hell,
we'll try anything,"

624
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:28,385
I'd like to hire Shakira
to belly dance

625
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:30,053
while singing <i>Waka Waka.</i>

626
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:33,257
As long as you get the mom
and Shakira to consent.

627
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:35,041
<i>It's no different</i>
<i>than having a priest</i>

628
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:37,511
or rabbi
lead a prayer vigil.

629
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:39,012
The mom is scared
and confused

630
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:42,683
<i>and desperate for anything</i>
<i>that'll give her hope.</i>

631
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,067
True.

632
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:45,686
But in the long run,
I think you'll be happier

633
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,654
having our lawyer
declare her unfit.

634
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:51,224
That way you won't be ratifying
superstition over science,

635
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:53,059
and I'll still
be working here.

636
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:55,195
And why would that
make me happier?

637
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:57,230
You're not going anywhere,

638
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,082
and we're not "ratifying"
their beliefs,

639
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,567
we're respecting them.

640
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:04,421
You do realize it may
involve animal sacrifice.

641
00:29:05,906 --> 00:29:08,575
People who live
in glass hospitals

642
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:10,961
should not
throw exorcisms.

643
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:13,764
I'll talk
to the mother.

644
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,634
I don't want to deny him
the medicine,

645
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:18,969
I just...

646
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:22,689
want to make sure
I try everything I can.

647
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:26,259
I understand that,

648
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:29,262
but you have to understand
that we're a hospital,

649
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:32,616
not a temple.

650
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,401
Then I'll
take him elsewhere.

651
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:35,969
No, you won't.

652
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:38,705
<i>He's sick.</i>
<i>We can't let him leave here.</i>

653
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:41,975
I'm sorry, you really
have no choice.

654
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:48,715
I spoke to a lawyer.

655
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:51,752
He told me as long
as I wasn't saying no

656
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:54,921
to your treatment,
you couldn't say no

657
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:58,975
to my religion.

658
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:07,317
Give me 24 hours.

659
00:30:22,283 --> 00:30:25,085
This came
in the mail today!

660
00:30:29,507 --> 00:30:30,557
I'm sorry.

661
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,042
<i>I should've told you.</i>

662
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:34,177
Told me what?

663
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:37,130
I don't understand.

664
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,166
What's the letter?

665
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:41,885
It's from my Uncle
in Poland.

666
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:45,689
My Aunt Luba, they put her
in nursing home two months ago!

667
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:47,941
That's too bad.

668
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:49,693
My mother, I talk
to her twice a week

669
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:51,862
and she never
even mentioned it.

670
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:53,647
Wh--what does she think?
That I can't handle?

671
00:30:53,698 --> 00:30:57,517
I am 29 years old!
I am not a child!

672
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:07,160
Were you going out
tonight?

673
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,566
I could stay.

674
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,015
He's still
barely breathing.

675
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:30,049
Lue?

676
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:31,568
How you feeling?

677
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:34,855
Any stronger?

678
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,055
Lue, can you hear me?

679
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:37,991
What's wrong?
I'm not sure.

680
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:42,228
Lue, I need you
to squeeze my hand.

681
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,115
He's not responding.
Get me an amp of D50!

682
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,235
You were wrong again?

683
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:58,178
I'm calling
his grandfather.

684
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:34,538
<i>Genetic tests for Brugada</i>
<i>and long QT variants</i>

685
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:35,656
<i>came back negative.</i>

686
00:32:35,707 --> 00:32:37,090
What about
a carotid aneurysm?

687
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:38,191
<i>We should do</i>
<i>an angiogram.</i>

688
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:40,160
He's got normal
carotid pulses.

689
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:42,412
Who cares?

690
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:44,698
Mom's given up,
why shouldn't I?

691
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:45,916
I'm sorry,

692
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,135
do we not treat idiots?
Because I thought--

693
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:49,136
<i>Her kid levitated.</i>

694
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:50,220
That happens to my girl,

695
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:52,422
I'm expanding
my diagnostic horizons.

696
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:54,675
All the more reason
why we should shut down.

697
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:56,226
<i>We cure this kid now,</i>

698
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:57,844
<i>crazy grandpa</i>
<i>and his magic beads</i>

699
00:32:57,895 --> 00:32:59,930
get all the credit.

700
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:02,015
And since when do you care
about credit?

701
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:04,818
Since when do I care
about this kid?

702
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:07,270
All I care about
is sending mommy

703
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:10,223
out into the world
having faith in faith.

704
00:33:10,274 --> 00:33:13,193
Kid's better off dead.

705
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:16,363
As soon as she's done
appeasing the Gods, let's talk.

706
00:33:16,414 --> 00:33:17,698
What about Kawasaki?

707
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:19,282
<i>It explains</i>
<i>the irregular heartbeat,</i>

708
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:20,584
<i>respiratory distress,</i>
<i>and seizures.</i>

709
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:22,035
It fits.

710
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:25,038
Which means he needs
a coronary bypass.

711
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:27,090
<i>It can't be Kawasaki.</i>

712
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:29,710
Echo would have
shown it.

713
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:31,428
But a patent ductus
arteriosis--

714
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,180
it can't be a PDA.
He's not an infant,

715
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:35,349
nor has he had any symptoms
for eight years.

716
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:36,583
Maybe he has.

717
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,018
Maybe he had
an infected ductus,

718
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:40,804
which we inadvertently
treated with antibiotics.

719
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:43,306
So no evidence
is evidence of evidence?

720
00:33:43,391 --> 00:33:45,275
I'm just saying,
it's consistent.

721
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,526
It's a billion-to-one.

722
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:48,311
Which means there's
seven people in the world

723
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:49,763
who fit the diagnosis.

724
00:33:49,814 --> 00:33:50,947
I thought we were
looking for 100.

725
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:53,200
Well, maybe PDA

726
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:54,618
is more common
than we thought.

727
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:55,769
With idiot doctors
like you--

728
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,988
You're wrong.

729
00:33:58,072 --> 00:34:00,073
But the treatment's
just ibuprofen.

730
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,442
<i>Closes</i>
<i>the malformed duct.</i>

731
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,378
Worst-case scenario,
he just doesn't get better,

732
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:07,581
No, worst-case scenario
is you piss me off--

733
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:09,132
You're not gonna let us
save an eight-year-old

734
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:11,284
because one more person
might embrace religion?

735
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,174
Does anyone here think
my diagnosis is right?

736
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:21,144
Well, then
I have decided,

737
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:24,681
for today only,
to respect your opinions.

738
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:26,933
We will proceed
according to your diagnosis

739
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,736
and nothing else.

740
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:32,406
That's an order.

741
00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:34,324
Good luck.

742
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:45,669
We need to put him
on the O.R. schedule.

743
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:58,098
<i>His B.P.'s dropping.</i>

744
00:34:58,165 --> 00:34:59,850
He's crashing.
Call a code!

745
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:08,842
You need to stop this!

746
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:15,065
I'm giving him
the ibuprofen.

747
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:41,057
Dinner's almost ready.

748
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:45,712
I think I'll stick with
the fluids tonight, thanks.

749
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:46,930
Why are you sulking?

750
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:49,349
I'm not sulking.

751
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,186
Oh, my mistake.

752
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:01,912
Mmm.

753
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:04,247
Either religion
is killing a kid,

754
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:08,201
or I am.

755
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,264
What are you doing?

756
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:25,085
Comforting my husband
after a bad day.

757
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,430
If this is not
what you want,

758
00:36:37,481 --> 00:36:40,233
I go back
to making dinner.

759
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:11,147
I'm not
gonna answer that.

760
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:13,433
Oh, smart man.

761
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,575
This is killing mood.

762
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:25,912
U.S. citizenship!

763
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,947
I'll get it.

764
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,648
This is Mrs. House,

765
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,033
please give good news,
so my husband and I

766
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:33,219
can go back to sex.

767
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:37,156
<i>Budmo!</i> Is fantastic!

768
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:49,936
How many notices
you send me?

769
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:59,112
O-okay, I--I come pick up
naturalization certificate.

770
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:03,016
Thank you for calling.

771
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:13,043
I'm sorry.

772
00:38:24,255 --> 00:38:26,039
Dr. Adams, Dr. Taub?

773
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:30,894
His vitals are improving.
He's stabilizing.

774
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:40,987
He's gonna be okay.

775
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,774
It worked.

776
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:47,560
Um, no, it didn't.

777
00:38:47,611 --> 00:38:49,279
Mrs. Cheng, the medicine
I administered

778
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:51,665
was a long-shot treatment
for Lue's heart,

779
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:55,035
but that's
what's helping him.

780
00:38:55,086 --> 00:38:56,870
Ibuprofen?

781
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:58,288
That's for headaches.

782
00:38:58,372 --> 00:38:59,706
I know it seems
hard to believe,

783
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:02,258
but it's true.

784
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:04,644
And I know this seems hard
for you to believe.

785
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:13,937
Honey...

786
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,188
Grandpa was right.

787
00:39:15,255 --> 00:39:18,108
He saved you.

788
00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:25,699
There were two things
we thought were impossible.

789
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:28,368
One of them wasn't.

790
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:31,287
That's all we know.

Doesn't mean anything.

804

Idea got planted.
It was probably inevitable.

805
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:04,030
It means something.

806
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:05,915
What?

807
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,801

mean the obvious,

that you want
some of this.

809
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:15,592

that look is insulting?

810

Or it could just mean
that we like each other.

and you're pretty,

812

but we connect.
We feel safe.

813

each other.

814
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:41,568
Maybe.

815
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:46,789
Just testing
my theory.

816
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,351
Adams defied me.

817
00:41:58,418 --> 00:42:02,438
There's one more zealot

818
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:05,792

You were a little short

You do need an excuse.
Cancer may be overplaying it.
