00:00:03,485 --> 00:00:04,723
We're in the car, honey.

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:10,495
We're going to
the hospital for tests.

3
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:16,479
We're in the hospital.

4
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:20,316
We're going
to the Doctor's office.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,934
Yeah.

6
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:30,026
Can you tell me
what this is called?

7
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:32,528
Uh, you use it to get
food from inside.

8
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:35,865
Yes, but what's
it called?

9
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,533
Is it a spatula?

10
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,585
- No.
<i>- Good.</i>

11
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:40,819
Is it a can opener?

12
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:43,623
Uh, no, it's, um...

13
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:46,992
It's, um...

14
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:50,763
You're trying
to make me look stupid.

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,181
You can go to hell!

16
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:54,050
Why don't you
kill yourself?

17
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:56,352
Andres.

18
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:58,137
It's okay.

19
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:04,894
There she is.

20
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:06,946
Here I am.

21
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:08,147
Here, come on.

22
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:15,655
You just need to answer
a few more questions.

23
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:17,540
Then we're going home.
We'll have lunch, okay?

24
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:21,577
Okay.

25
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:25,214
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:27,866
I have Alzheimer's.

27
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:30,086
I know.

28
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,422
The mood swings come on
quickly, but, um...

29
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:35,257
It's under control.

30
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:38,477
Don't worry. He's actually
perfect for the drug trial.

31
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,597
Oh.

32
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:43,399
Thank God.

33
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,234
We can start
as soon as next week.

a phase-two trial

Isn't that the point
of having a spare?

64
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:18,494
I denied his request.

<i>- Damn it.</i>

76
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:56,365
Look, the point is
I saw this coming.

77
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,017
Dr. Foreman and I did not
always see eye-to-eye.

78
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,070
But he never had the power
to overrule me.

79
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:02,621
Now that he has the power,
he won't be able

80
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,690
to resist the temptation
to use it.

81
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:07,660
With great power
comes great micromanaging.

82
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:09,078
And great vests.

83
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:11,697
I know you're
the better diagnostician.

84
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:14,333
I'm not gonna interfere.
I'm only here to help.

85
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:16,669
Could be transient nitrogen load
from a G.I. bleed.

86
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,203
Not if the vomiting's
persistent.

87
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:20,973
Which we won't know, because
the E.R. put him on antiemetics.

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,374
Take him off.

89
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:25,895
Wait. He's puking his guts out.
We'd risk aspiration.

90
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:30,099
I'm just disagreeing,
not overruling.

91
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,101
So glad you're on board.

92
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,436
<i>Take him off antiemetics,</i>

93
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:37,690
do an upper endoscopy
to check for bleeds.

94
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:44,496
It could be
a bladder infection.

95
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:45,898
We'll run
a pregnancy test.

96
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,199
Oh, I'm not pregnant.

97
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,618
Any type of birth control
can fail.

98
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:51,403
Not mine.

99
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:56,208
Oh, I'm sorry.
You said you were married.

100
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:57,459
Yeah, happily.

101
00:04:57,544 --> 00:04:59,712
That's okay.

102
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:03,382
Sex can wane in any
marriage over time.

103
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,251
No, no.
We've never had sex.

104
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:08,470
Oh, we kiss and cuddle,

105
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:12,257
but neither one of us
is interested in sex.

106
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:15,444
You're...both celibate.

107
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,363
No, neither of us.

108
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,784
Celibacy is a choice.
This is our orientation.

109
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:25,905
We're asexual.

110
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:29,792
Not quite sure
what box to check here.

111
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:31,243
<i>You're making a mistake.</i>

112
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:32,878
If I had the power
to veto him,

113
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:35,214
given all the crap I've
put up with over the years,

114
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,966
don't know if I could
use it objectively.

115
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,919
I do, I can, I have.

116
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,005
Might be easier if you'd
stay out of the room.

117
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:44,556
I thought
it'd be different.

118
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,225
This week.

119
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,643
Supposed to talk
to his P.O.

120
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:50,312
about getting his
ankle monitor off early.

121
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:51,797
You're saying he should
defer to you?

122
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,600
No, I'm just saying what he's
doing doesn't seem rational,

123
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,318
which makes me think
it's rational

124
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,270
in a way
I'm not privy to.

125
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,105
He always has a plan.

126
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:02,191
And he's always
self-destructive.

127
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:07,913
He may just be shooting
himself in the ankle.

128
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,253
I know it feels strange.

129
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,205
Dr. Chase is just
looking in your throat.

130
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:17,706
<i>We're in the hospital.</i>

131
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,658

132
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,011

trophy, there, Andres.

133
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:23,495
<i>He coached youth soccer.</i>

134
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,047
Took a team that was 0-6

135
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:29,001
all the way to the state finals
at Long Branch.

136
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:35,173
Hey, thanks for
doing this in here.

137
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:37,626
Switching rooms
can be very disorienting.

138
00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:39,144
You take very good
care of him.

139
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:42,398
I love him.
Sickness and health, right?

140
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:44,450
Upper esophagus
is clear.

141
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,786
Moving on to
the G.E. junction.

142
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:48,871
Hi.

143
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:51,040
- Hey.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

144
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:52,992
Family members only
during procedures.

145
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:54,994
Uh, I'll--
I'll be outside.

146
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,128
Oh, no. Please, um,

147
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:58,380
<i>it's okay.</i>

148
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:02,217
Joseph helps me
with my husband sometimes.

149
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:03,535
He's a good friend.

150
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:06,505
Which means not family.

151
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,973
<i>Wait, we're gonna</i>
<i>be here a while.</i>

152
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,010
Why don't you show Joseph
where the visitor's lounge is?

153
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,178
Okay.

154
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,601
What?

155
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:22,521
Surprised you didn't
go into the diplomatic corps.

156
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,640
Oh, you think
they're...

157
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:31,180
No, if they're having sex, it's
probably with their genitals.

158
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:33,198
Mallory-Weiss tear.

159
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,534
Vomiting must have
torn the lining.

160
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,622
You know that close to
1% of the population

161
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:44,126
identifies as asexual?

162
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,379
We really gotta
get you laid.

163
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,248
If I have to plough
that furrow myself, so be it.

164
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,518
I have a patient
who's asexual.

165
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:55,054
Is she a giant pool
of algae?

166
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:56,939
It's a valid
sexual orientation.

167
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:58,524
According to this
article, at least.

168
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:00,476
Yeah, I think
I read that too.

169
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,094
Is that
<i>fugliness weekly?</i>

170
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:03,862
She's perfectly
fine-looking.

171
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,197
Happily married
for ten years.

172
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:07,149
To a guy who loves penis
enough for the both of them.

173
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:10,536
He's asexual too.

174
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:11,870
Ran a complete
physical on her.

175
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:16,658
Nothing wrong except
a common bladder infection.

176
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:19,878
100 bucks says I can
find a medical reason

177
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:21,163
why she doesn't
want to have sex.

178
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,714
You're out of your mind

179
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,616
if you think I'm letting you
anywhere near my patient.

180
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,085
Fine.
I won't go near her.

181
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,386
Just give me her file

182
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:29,888
and any blood samples
you have left over.

183
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:34,593
No contact, whatsoever.

184
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,395
You talk to her,
the bet is void.

185
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:37,462
No contact.

186
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:40,298
Plays to my
strengths anyway.

187
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:49,274
Right now's not
a good time, House.

188
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:50,976
Not for the Dean
of Medicine.

189
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:52,945
But it's a perfect time
if you're a member of my team.

190
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:56,481
Which one are you?

191
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,650
What did
the endoscopy show?

192
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:01,003
<i>No signs of ulcers</i>
<i>or blockages.</i>

193
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:08,177
But you found a tear
just below the esophagus.

194
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:09,962
Explains the bleeding.

195
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:12,431
Doesn't explain why he vomited
so hard he ripped his insides.

196
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,099
His liver enzymes
are slightly elevated.

197
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,100
Gallstones could've--

198
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,468
no complaints of pain.

199
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,223
Steatohepatitis would make his
AST and ATL levels rise.

200
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:24,226
Are you calling
his liver fat?

201
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,778
Start the patient on statins,
and do a biopsy to confirm.

202
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:27,779
<i>And knock him out.</i>

203
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,448
I've heard he's a wiggler.

204
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:30,816
There's no need
to put him under.

205
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:33,402
We can confirm fatty liver
with an ultrasound.

206
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:36,405
Just making
an observation.

207
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:38,457
Well done.

208
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:39,958
Now, as a member
of my team,

209
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,161
you can make the equally-useful
observations

210
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:44,079
that the sky is blue,
I'm wearing pants,

211
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:46,698
and I'm ignoring
your first observation.

212
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:48,033
Of course.

213
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,423
Wait.

214
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:57,059
And there it is.

215
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:58,560
You're trying to screw
with my confidence.

216
00:09:58,645 --> 00:09:59,878
Well, if I wanted
to do that,

217
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,597
I'd tell you how much
the nurses hate you.

218
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:04,233
You're trying to get me to
define myself as a subordinate

219
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,101
to keep me from
ever intervening,

220
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:07,886
even if it's fully
in the scope of my duties.

221
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:09,238
Like now.

222
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:10,856
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>about diagnostics,</i>

223
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:12,241
<i>it's about what's safe</i>
<i>for the patient.</i>

224
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,942
Do the ultrasound.

225
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,862
Ultrasound it is.

226
00:10:16,913 --> 00:10:18,897
And the nurses love you.

227
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,420
You don't think I knew
House was gonna tell you

228
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:27,673
to ignore me and not
do the ultrasound?

229
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,908
This is an
ultrasound machine.

230
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,461
Which you're gonna use to do
an ultrasound-guided biopsy.

231
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,379
<i>Probably got a kit</i>
<i>stashed here...</i>

232
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,059
"Cuddy dark
will waste his afternoon

233
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,860
chasing
conspiracy theories."

234
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,428
<i>You're letting him</i>
<i>get inside your head.</i>

235
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,981
He could do a lot
of damage in there.

236
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:56,068
Dr. Chase.

237
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,953
He started
vomiting again.

238
00:11:00,323 --> 00:11:02,991
This is why we stopped
the antiemetics.

239
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:04,660
<i>We needed to see if</i>
<i>it was still a symptom.</i>

240
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:06,712
Okay.

241
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,713
Here, you want this?

242
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,831
Get your hands off me.

243
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,633
You're taking my head.

244
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:14,052
It's okay, Andres.

245
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,887
You're in the hospital.

246
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,507
Here.

247
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:25,480
- 10 milligrams of Diazepam!
- Already on it.

248
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,232
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

249
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,986
I'm all right.

250
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:35,307
Foreman.

251
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:37,309
Blood in his urine.

252
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,726
Resume the antiemetics,
and increase the sedation.

253
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:45,649
He really went after her.

254
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:47,701
Maybe he found out
about her "good friend."

255
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:50,488
It was just paranoid rage,
typical of Alzheimer's.

256
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:52,073
We don't even know if they
were sleeping together.

257
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:54,108
A few hours ago
you were sure.

258
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,160
And that's
significant why?

259
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:59,213
Sorry. Only the bleeding's
medically relevant.

260
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,581
No, I wasn't
being rhetorical.

261
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,967
If they are
sleeping together,

262
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:05,619
why do we disapprove?

263
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,171
You're pro-infidelity?

264
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:08,806
She's not married.

265
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,584
If marriage is feeding
and cleaning someone,

266
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:16,396
limiting conversations, to
repeating a few simple commands,

267
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:18,249
then I was married
to my pet rat.

268
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,835
And a lot of people
owe me wedding gifts.

269
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:22,586
And we're walking,
we're walking.

270
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:24,588
I don't care how sick
your spouse gets,

271
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:26,257
you don't jump ship.

272
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:27,574
Alzheimer's
is different.

273
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:29,043
She can't share
her problems with him,

274
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:30,244
or plan for the future.

275
00:12:30,295 --> 00:12:31,846
The man she married
no longer exists.

276
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:33,631
Yes, he does.
He's in there.

277
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:35,516
This is why
you get married.

278
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,219
Said the divorced woman
to the divorced man.

279
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,970
I didn't jump ship.

280
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:42,589
My husband sank it
when he cheated on me.

281
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:44,475
Commitment's
not conditional.

282
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,228
She is there for him in the only
way that matters now.

283
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,529
She gave up her life
to take care of him.

284
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:49,930
Which proves
she's an idiot.

285
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:51,982
If she had any sense, she'd have
stuck him in a facility

286
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,484
and jumped
on that strange--

287
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:55,152
Dr. Foreman.

288
00:12:55,237 --> 00:12:56,320
We were just
looking for you.

289
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:58,405
I was right about
the antiemetics.

290
00:12:58,456 --> 00:12:59,824
If you kept him
on them like I said,

291
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:01,709
he wouldn't have gotten agitated
and punched his wife.

292
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:04,245
Yes, we're back to my
supposed diabolical plan

293
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:06,446
to shake your confidence.

294
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:08,749
Let's see if this helps.

295
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,918
If you're speaking
as a team member,

296
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:12,553
then I'd say
you're a moron.

297
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,121
Because taking him
off the antiemetics

298
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,257
gave us crucial
diagnostic information.

299
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:18,092
If you're speaking
as Dean of Medicine,

300
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:19,593
then I'd say
you're a moron.

301
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:22,296
'Cause your micromanaging
kept us from doing a biopsy.

302
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:24,098
If we had, the patient
would have been anesthetized

303
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,634
hours ago, thus unable to go
all Chris Brown on her ass.

304
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:29,353
Unless one of your index cards

305
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:31,972
actually predicted the guy
was gonna punch his wife,

306
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:34,859
everything you're saying
is post hoc rationalization.

307
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,410
Dr. Park,

308
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:39,646
would you please
reach under that chair?

309
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:45,252
"The patient will
punch his wife."

310
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,606
<i>You clearly wrote that</i>
<i>after the fact.</i>

311
00:13:48,673 --> 00:13:49,673
Dr. Adams,

312
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:53,160
would you please
reach into my pants?

313
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:00,517
"Dr. Blackenshmurtz

314
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:03,671
will accuse me of writing
about the punch after the fact."

315
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:05,105
Now, look.

316
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:07,641
Here's a photograph
of me holding a newspaper.

317
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,360
Dated last Tuesday.

318
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:11,028
Now, how could I have
gotten my hands on that?

319
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:12,313
You done?

320
00:14:12,364 --> 00:14:14,899
Rhabdomyolysis
fits the vomiting,

321
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:16,183
pigmenturia,
and renal failure.

322
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,235
No muscle symptoms,
and urine had no myoglobin.

323
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,404
<i>TTP fits, though.</i>

324
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:23,357
Start him
on plasmapheresis.

325
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:26,410
Unless...

326
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:29,863
Unless I need to say,
"mother, may I?"

327
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:33,533
And mother
is an abbreviation.

328
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:38,589
<i>Fresh plasma will replace</i>
<i>the damaged red blood cells</i>

329
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:39,473
that are clogging
his kidneys.

330
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,391
That sounds hopeful.

331
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:43,177
How is that feeling?

332
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:47,398
I've never been hit
in the eye before.

333
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:50,217
I feel kinda badass.

334
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:54,438
I think maybe
you should go.

335
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:56,690
I'm fine. Okay?

336
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:58,325
See you tomorrow.

337
00:14:58,393 --> 00:14:59,243
Okay.

338
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:05,666
We're not
having an affair.

339
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:06,917
It's none
of my business.

340
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:10,871
I mean, not--
not really.

341
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,039
'Cause nothing's happened.

342
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,677
We've talked
about it a lot, and...

343
00:15:16,744 --> 00:15:20,381
It's just really hard
doing this by myself.

344
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,184
When's the last time you had
a full night's sleep?

345
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:27,721
Um...

346
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:30,557
I don't know.
Three years.

347
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:35,262
You're not going to
get any rest here.

348
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:37,264
People who are sick
are not the only ones

349
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:39,199
who need to be
taken care of.

350
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:49,743
Why doesn't Chase
have to be here?

351
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:51,345
You think he knows
anything about women

352
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,981
who don't want
to have sex?

353
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:55,983
Hormone levels
are normal.

354
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,319
This woman seems
perfectly healthy.

355
00:15:58,386 --> 00:16:00,204
What does it matter
if she says she's asexual?

356
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:02,072
It's the fundamental drive
of our species.

357
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,324
Sex is healthy.

358
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:04,958
<i>Orgasms oxygenate</i>
<i>the brain,</i>

359
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,744
<i>lighting up over</i>
<i>30 different areas</i>

360
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:11,415
and making us forget
how boring Susie Cooper is.

361
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,517
That last one may not
be universal.

362
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:15,019
How about damage
to her spinal cord

363
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:17,254
blocking the signals
from her genitals?

364
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,739
Sex drive is in the brain.

365
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,759
<i>I suppose it could be</i>
<i>psychological intimacy issues</i>

366
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:23,160
caused by childhood abuse.

367
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:24,762
She's been sharing a toilet
with the same guy

368
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:25,912
for the last ten years.

369
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:26,930
That's not the same.

370
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:28,465
<i>Sex releases oxytocin.</i>

371
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,417
It's the neurochemical basis
for bonding.

372
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,603
And that's why men
always marry their right hands.

373
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:33,771
It's different for girls.

374
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:34,638
<i>No it's not.</i>

375
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:36,323
I've tapped over 30 guys

376
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:40,427
and never wanted to see
most of them again.

377
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:43,597
I live next to
a Jewish frat.

378
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:46,266
We are veering wildly off track.
Please continue.

379
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:49,319
This woman's life is probably
better off without sex.

380
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:51,538
<i>Eliminates most</i>
<i>of her insecurity,</i>

381
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,240
she's immune
to most advertising

382
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,909
and can have honest
relationships with men.

383
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,295
Not a lot of them.

384
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,881
We've run every test
and ruled out all the options.

385
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:03,584
You're gonna have to accept
she just doesn't want sex.

386
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:04,885
Lots of people
don't have sex.

387
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:06,053
The only people
who don't want it

388
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,888
are either sick,
dead, or lying.

389
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:09,673
<i>So maybe she's lying.</i>

390
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:10,641
You think she's had
a boyfriend on the side?

391
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,076
<i>For ten years?</i>

392
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:16,930
Sticking around the whole time?
Doesn't make sense.

393
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:19,933
What does...

394
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:26,640
30?

395
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,642
Everybody lies.

396
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:34,948
Higher or lower?

397
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:41,922
Followed your advice
and took the night off.

398
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:43,173
Seems to have
done you some good.

399
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:44,458
Mm-Hmm.

400
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:52,999
Where's my husband?

401
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:55,836
He's not in the hospital.

402
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:57,187
So he just walked out?

403
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:58,472
<i>All of the shift nurses</i>

404
00:17:58,523 --> 00:17:59,412
had their hands full
with a double code.

405
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:01,054
Perfectly reasonable explanation.

406
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,547
<i>Same thing happened to me.</i>
<i>Couldn't find my keys for days.</i>

407
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,215
The police
have been notified.

408
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,067
I have staff searching.

409
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,236
You told me
it was okay to leave.

410
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,854
I'm sorry.

411
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:12,840
He has Alzheimer's!

412
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:15,576
<i>It's freezing outside,</i>
<i>and he's sick!</i>

413
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,495
I mean, you don't even know
what it is yet, do you?

414
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:20,581
The plasmapheresis
hasn't had time to work,

415
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,115
but TTP is our
most likely--

416
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,002
Okay, I'm just--
I have to go look for him.

417
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,004
<i>Hey, don't be an ass.</i>

418
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,255
<i>Can't you see</i>
<i>she's upset?</i>

419
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:31,408
No, she's guilty.

420
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,909
'Cause instead of being
at her husband's side,

421
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:35,846
she was under you.

422
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:37,097
Okay, that's--y--

423
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,215
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

424
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,967
He already said
I was an ass.

425
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:41,718
Personally, I applaud
your decision

426
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:44,254
to step down off your cross
and get on with your life,

427
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:46,690
but your misplaced guilt
is shutting down your brain.

428
00:18:46,757 --> 00:18:52,279
We need you to sit, focus,
and answer our questions.

429
00:18:57,935 --> 00:18:59,736
So, at 6:00 a.m.,

430
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:01,038
the patient wakes up,

431
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:04,608
and the first thing
he sees...

432
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:05,959
In moments of confusion,

433
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,712
Alzheimer's patients
regress to old routines.

434
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:11,915
<i>So what would your husband do</i>
<i>on a Saturday morning?</i>

435
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:13,950
Nothing. Be at home.

436
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:16,169
What about a year ago?
Or five years? Ten?

437
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:19,139
I don't know, um, he...

438
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,141
He trained
for a marathon once.

439
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:25,846
<i>Soccer practice.</i>
<i>We took a cooking class.</i>

440
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,431
That soccer trophy
you were telling me about.

441
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:28,849
<i>It's gone.</i>

442
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,133
Where was practice?

443
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:33,770
It was close to here.
On Chesterfield.

444
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:50,820
Okay, he comes, he thinks
he's waiting for practice.

445
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:52,289
He'd want to get out
of the wind.

446
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,659
What's somewhere he could
see the kids arrive?

447
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,327
There.

448
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:02,349
Over here.

449
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,359
On three.
One, two, three.

450
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,814
Nothing.

451
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:20,117
Not dead until
he's warm and dead.

452
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,669
Get him to the ICU.

453
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,521
Start him on
extracorporeal circulation.

454
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,889
That'll raise his
temperature too quickly,

455
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:33,223
it'll cause acidosis.

456
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:35,059
We can deal with
his metabolism crashing,

457
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:37,111
we can't reverse brain damage
if we go too slowly.

458
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:39,229
Either way, we don't get his
temperature above 95,

459
00:20:39,314 --> 00:20:40,364
it's not going to matter.

460
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:44,785
Multiple warm lavage
is safer.

461
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,204
Do what House says.

462
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:59,450
He has no heartbeat,
and he's not breathing.

463
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:02,853
How can he not be dead?

464
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:05,139
The body slows down
when it cools,

465
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:06,840
but it doesn't fully stop.

466
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,676
We're warming his blood
outside of his body,

467
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:09,893
then putting it back.

468
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,595
It'll raise his
temperature enough

469
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,514
that his heart should
naturally start.

470
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,599
Then we can shock it
back into rhythm.

471
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:18,719
And if it doesn't start?

472
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:23,023
Then there's
nothing we can do.

473
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:32,833
You think it's possible
he knew what he was doing?

474
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,202
Like some part of him gets what
he's putting his wife through,

475
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,920
so he tried to--
kill himself?

476
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,905
It's what I'd do
if I were him.

477
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:41,875
At least I wish I would.

478
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:45,045
I meant run away.

479
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,714
You think you should
kill yourself

480
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,082
if you become a burden
to the people who love you?

481
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:51,752
If you really
love them back, then...

482
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:54,021
Yes.

483
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:58,192
That's really dark.

484
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,478
It's not naive.

485
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:04,264
I just believe
people are capable

486
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:05,649
of more than you do,
apparently.

487
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:10,771
We've got brain activity.

488
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:12,906
Temp's at 93.

489
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:15,442
His heart should
start soon.

490
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,881
My dad left me alone

491
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:23,634
to care for my alcoholic mom
and raise my baby sister.

492
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,252
<i>I was just a teenager.</i>

493
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,921
I spent half my time
changing diapers

494
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,625
and the other half
cleaning up my mom's vomit.

495
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:33,126
But it must've
been important

496
00:22:33,178 --> 00:22:35,429
that you stayed
for both of them.

497
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,515
Mom died after
a few years.

498
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,102
It was ugly and painful,
and she went with me hating her.

499
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,471
My sister ended up drinking
half of her life away

500
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:47,191
and hating me because
I couldn't help.

501
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:50,327
After mom,
I had nothing left.

502
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,997
So do I wish mom had used
a gun instead of a bottle?

503
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,082
Yes.

504
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:00,120
I--I didn't know.

505
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,656
That's why I told you.

506
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:09,830
Ventricular fibrillation.

507
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:13,100
300 milligrams
amiodarone.

508
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:23,694
Careful.

509
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,112
Once we establish rhythm,

510
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,565
any accidental movement
could crash him back into V-fib.

511
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,234
Clear.

512
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,213
We still have
a long way to go.

513
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,165
<i>Cold can be protective</i>
<i>to the brain,</i>

514
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:48,302
but there is
a possibility of damage.

515
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,970
We also need
to confirm and treat

516
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:52,339
whatever's
making him sick.

517
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,060
I just gotta do
a standard battery of tests.

518
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:59,229
<i>Blood, urine, eeg...</i>

519
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:01,899
Is that really necessary
for a free flu shot?

520
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,736
Excuse me.

521
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,190
I have to deal with someone
who's having a panic attack.

522
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,914
I specifically said

523
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,616
the bet was off if you
contacted the patient.

524
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:20,901
Exactly.

525
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:22,786
Never said anything
about the patient's husband.

526
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:27,040
The deal was a medical reason
why she doesn't have sex.

527
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,759
I admit I was stuck,

528
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:32,179
until I realized the medical
issue was not hers but his.

529
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:33,714
She's lying
to compensate.

530
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,749
It's a tale
as old as time.

531
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,801
Boy meets girl,
girl falls for boy,

532
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:42,606
boy says, "I'm asexual."
Girl says, "yeah, me too."

533
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,359
Your twisted logic
can't hide the fact

534
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:47,311
that tricking a patient
into being tested

535
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:48,779
is completely
unethical.

536
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,264
Come on.

537
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:53,066
Don't you think she deserves
to know why her husband

538
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,268
won't bend her over
the kitchen counter?

539
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,604
You love all that
caring crap.

540
00:24:57,655 --> 00:24:59,373
You're not doing this out of
the kindness of your heart.

541
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,658
You're not even doing this
out of medical curiosity.

542
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:04,044
I thought I made it clear
I'm doing it for the cash.

543
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:05,462
Two people are happy,

544
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,280
and your natural impulse
is to destroy it.

545
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:08,248
How do you know
she's happy?

546
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,783
Did she tell you?

547
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:13,253
No, chirping birds flew out
of her butt carrying a banner.

548
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,088
All right, I admit
that my natural impulse

549
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,974
is to doubt peoples'
claims to happiness,

550
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,559
but yours is to be
a sucker for them.

551
00:25:19,627 --> 00:25:23,480
You tell me
which one's worse.

552
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:33,240
He just opened his eyes
a little while ago.

553
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:35,158
His heartbeat's doing well,

554
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:38,078
and his body temperature
is stabilized.

555
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:51,625
There he is.

556
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,393
<i>Me sinto quente.</i>

557
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:55,095
Is that Portuguese?

558
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:58,548
Yeah.

559
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,851
Honey, I don't
understand.

560
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:04,271
<i>Me sinto quente.</i>

561
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:07,340
What's he saying?

562
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:09,977
I don't know.

563
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,640
I tried to learn
when we got married,

564
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:12,841
but I just--

565
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:18,869
it's okay. It's okay.

566
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,323
<i>His body temperature</i>
<i>is rising.</i>

567
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,459
It's above normal.

568
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,710
Wait, I thought--

569
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,045
I thought you said
it was stable.

570
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,379
Why is it still rising?

571
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:30,497
I don't know.

572
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:34,050
Vomiting, liver,
kidneys, and now fever.

573
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,022
I don't want to tell you
how to do your job, Dr. Foreman,

574
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:41,691
since telling people
how to do their job is your job,

575
00:26:41,742 --> 00:26:43,693
but when your

576
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:45,829
less-than-competent
administration of this hospital

577
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,447
affects what's written
on my whiteboard...

578
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:48,532
Get to the point.

579
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,367
The word "fever."

580
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:51,785
Could come from
the patient's illness,

581
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:53,253
or it could come from the fact
that you allowed him

582
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:55,956
to saunter out of your hospital
and take a nap in the snow.

583
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,008
Couldn't have caught a virus
while he was outside.

584
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,076
Fever came on too fast.

585
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:04,548
The hypothermia could've
caused cell necrosis.

586
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,766
TTP was the diagnosis
when he walked out.

587
00:27:06,851 --> 00:27:09,386
Fever's a little high,
but it still fits.

588
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:11,938
We should continue
plasmapheresis.

589
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:13,590
We're missing symptoms.

590
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:15,475
We should add language loss
and aggression.

591
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,943
<i>Should we also</i>
<i>add forgetfulness?</i>

592
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:18,695
- He's got Alzheimer's.
- We've just been assuming.

593
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,280
Because the patient's wife

594
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:21,481
said he exhibited
both for a year.

595
00:27:21,566 --> 00:27:23,149
He's never hit her before

596
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:24,317
or lost all his English.

597
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:25,935
We have to consider
any change

598
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:26,870
since he's been admitted
as relevant.

599
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,071
Have to?

600
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:30,607
Do I need to pull out
another card?

601
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:33,793
Disseminated viral infection
with encephalitis.

602
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:39,616
<i>Patient complained of</i>
<i>a sore throat a few weeks ago.</i>

603
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:44,554
Start him on Interferon.

604
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:49,175
<i>Encephalitis makes</i>
<i>his brain swell,</i>

605
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,427
which causes symptoms
that are

606
00:27:50,478 --> 00:27:52,145
hard to distinguish
from his Alzheimer's.

607
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,348
With the Interferon
his English should come back,

608
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,150
and the aggression
should subside.

609
00:27:57,235 --> 00:27:58,902
But you're not sure.

610
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,321
Unfortunately, no.

611
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:05,976
And you're not sure if he has
brain damage from being frozen.

612
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:13,316
So best-case scenario,

613
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:18,338
I've just had a glimpse
into his future?

614
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:23,326
I can't take care
of him anymore.

615
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:25,345
<i>Chances are his mental state</i>
<i>will improve.</i>

616
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,964
You could get
more time with him.

617
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:31,968
We married six months
after I met him.

618
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:36,856
A year after that,
he started forgetting things.

619
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:39,359
I've known my husband
longer with his Alzheimer's

620
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:40,560
than without.

621
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:42,312
I've watched
more of him disappear

622
00:28:42,363 --> 00:28:45,115
than I ever got to know.

623
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,952
I just can't
do this anymore.

624
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,575
You lose.

625
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,713
Blood work shows
high levels of prolactin.

626
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:02,666
Add that to some peripheral
red-green confusion,

627
00:29:02,717 --> 00:29:05,085
puts my money--
excuse me, your money--

628
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:06,536
soon to be my money

629
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:08,838
<i>on a tumor</i>
<i>near his pituitary.</i>

630
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:11,408
Probably started growing
in his early teens.

631
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:12,875
Lowering his libido

632
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:15,261
and causing
erectile dysfunction.

633
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:17,230
<i>A year on</i>
<i>dopamine agonists,</i>

634
00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:19,866
and he'll be a sex-crazed creep
just like the rest of us,

635
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:23,570
completely fascinated
by Susie Cooper.

636
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:26,856
I'd prefer to be paid
in a single $100 bill.

637
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:29,058
Always wanted to use one
to light a cigar.

638
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,997
Hooray for us.
We disproved his asexuality.

639
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,832
We also probably
ruined his life.

640
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,783
<i>He'll thank us.</i>

641
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:38,585
Then he'll doze off,

642
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:41,254
and then in a couple hours,
he'll thank us again.

643
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:43,406
It could destroy
his identity.

644
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:46,459
It's like a gay person being
told they're really straight.

645
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:48,345
So don't tell him.

646
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,546
Yeah, why bother
telling a guy

647
00:29:49,597 --> 00:29:51,097
he has a tumor
growing in his head?

648
00:29:51,182 --> 00:29:53,383
He'll notice it eventually, when
it starts leaking out his ears.

649
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:55,051
<i>It's a slow-growing tumor.</i>

650
00:29:55,102 --> 00:29:58,555
He'll probably die
of boredom long before that.

651
00:29:58,606 --> 00:29:59,756
You always do this.

652
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:01,524
You--you meddle

653
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:04,894
and force me into
impossible situations.

654
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:06,646
You knew the second
you told me about this case

655
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:08,398
that I'd get involved.

656
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:09,566
You wanted me to meddle.

657
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:11,618
Because no matter
how much you wanted

658
00:30:11,702 --> 00:30:13,486
to believe in this
chaste romance,

659
00:30:13,571 --> 00:30:16,039
you didn't
buy it either.

660
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,924
Where's that petition
House's P.O. sent over

661
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:20,126
about getting his
ankle monitor off?

662
00:30:20,211 --> 00:30:22,278
On your desk.

663
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,097
You played me.

664
00:30:41,148 --> 00:30:43,733
This whole thing was about
your ankle monitor.

665
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:46,486
You weren't trying
to undermine my confidence,

666
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,821
you were trying
to inflate it.

667
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:49,972
You manufactured
conflict with me

668
00:30:50,024 --> 00:30:51,524
so eventually
you could let me win.

669
00:30:51,592 --> 00:30:54,194
You knew it was encephalitis,
but you waited for me to say it

670
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:56,196
because then
with my ego boosted,

671
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,697
you thought I'd be in the mood
to take off your monitor

672
00:30:57,782 --> 00:31:01,868
because I'd think
I could control you.

673
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:07,457
You're right.
Take off my monitor.

674
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:09,709
See, the beauty
of the plan

675
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:12,128
is that if it works,
you think you can control me.

676
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,015
If it fails, then you will
actually have proven

677
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,134
that you can control me.

678
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:20,804
It's pretty genius.

679
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:23,773
These are your
training wheels.

680
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,341
If you think
you're up to this job,

681
00:31:25,392 --> 00:31:27,777
it's time to lose them.

682
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:43,526
Second half of my plan
might need work.

683
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:55,371
V-fib. Two rounds of 360
without establishing a rhythm.

684
00:31:57,641 --> 00:32:01,845
Wait, Dr. Foreman!

685
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:03,229
Clear.

686
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:10,019
He's back.

687
00:32:19,694 --> 00:32:21,734
I sure hope this
Alzheimer's drug trial

688
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:23,069
is worth a lot
to this hospital,

689
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,820
'cause we're wasting a crap-load
of time and manpower

690
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:27,439
just to let this guy
watch his mind shrivel

691
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:28,991
and keep his wife
miserable.

692
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:30,109
Heart attack
while he was on Interferon

693
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,527
rules out encephalitis,

694
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:34,413
but I still think I'm right
about the neural symptoms.

695
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:35,798
It's probably
aseptic meningitis.

696
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:37,249
Would have seen
meningial signs.

697
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,301
Given his abnormal
mental status, not necessarily.

698
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:40,503
<i>Dr. Foreman,</i>

699
00:32:40,587 --> 00:32:43,756
would you please
reach under your chair?

700
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:50,513
There's just wet gum under here.
Where's the card?

701
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:54,133
What card?

702
00:32:54,184 --> 00:32:55,434
I'm happy to leave
if you have

703
00:32:55,485 --> 00:32:57,853
<i>a better theory</i>
<i>than aseptic meningitis.</i>

704
00:32:57,938 --> 00:32:59,105
Toxins.

705
00:32:59,156 --> 00:33:00,356
This guy went
on walkabout.

706
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,191
<i>Chances are</i>
<i>he's done it before.</i>

707
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:03,492
Wife keeps the doors
on the house locked.

708
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:04,977
Plenty of nasty stuff
to get into

709
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:06,078
during the middle
of the night.

710
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:07,312
We asked about toxins
on the history.

711
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:08,664
The wife said she was
sure to clear the house

712
00:33:08,749 --> 00:33:09,749
for her husband's safety.

713
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:11,150
I'm sure she succeeded.

714
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:14,153
She's a PhD
in toxicology, right?

715
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:15,504
She's an ex-florist.

716
00:33:15,572 --> 00:33:16,806
Search the home
for toxic plants,

717
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:20,042
methyl bromide,
any medications.

718
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:22,327
Stop.

719
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,430
You're not infallible. You were
wrong about encephalitis.

720
00:33:24,497 --> 00:33:25,381
Just before you were.

721
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:26,766
Run CSF tests.

722
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,018
<i>Find out what's</i>
<i>causing the meningitis.</i>

723
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:33,105
You said you weren't gonna
overrule me diagnostically.

724
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,191
And you said I wouldn't
be able to help it.

725
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:37,943
Apparently, you were
right about that one.

726
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:40,813
<i>Fine.</i>

727
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,865
I'll look
for toxins myself.

728
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:44,683
You can't go to their house
without Foreman's permission.

729
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,018
Don't need it.

730
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,587
I'll talk to
the toxicology PhD upstairs.

731
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:50,756
<i>What about gifts</i>
<i>from South America?</i>

732
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:53,275
Anyone send any fruits
or vegetables?

733
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:55,711
I don't think so, no.

734
00:33:55,796 --> 00:33:58,998
<i>Barraco azul...</i>

735
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:00,666
I'm gonna need
your boyfriend

736
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,651
<i>to collect samples</i>
<i>of plants</i>

737
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:05,137
in and around your house.
Toxins are the most...

738
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:07,256
<i>Barraco azul...</i>

739
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,643
<i>O que e isso?</i>
<i>Barraco azul?</i>

740
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,429
Wait,
you understand him?

741
00:34:13,513 --> 00:34:17,216
What's he saying?

742
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:20,102
He's--he's repeating,
"blue shack."

743
00:34:20,187 --> 00:34:22,021
You know what that is?

744
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:24,406
Is it somewhere where
pesticides may be kept?

745
00:34:24,474 --> 00:34:30,346
It's where we had
our first date.

746
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:33,732
Do you have a cleaning lady

747
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:36,702
who might bring
her own supplies?

748
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:38,170
What's he saying?

749
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:40,956
If it's not relevant
to the case, I don't care.

750
00:34:40,957 --> 00:34:42,041
And neither should you.

751
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:43,564
Please.

752
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:47,568
This might be the last time
I ever know what he's thinking.

753
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:57,611
When I saw her waiting...

754
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,283
Waiting for me
at the table...

755
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,820
The way her eyes looked
when she smiled...

756
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,926
I felt like crying.

757
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:20,100
I knew that she was
the woman I wanted to marry.

758
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:23,553
Every time I see her,
I say...

759
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:26,690
<i>La esta ela.</i>

760
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:28,809
There she is.
There she is.

761
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:36,950
He's still in there.

762
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:38,986
<i>Quem e ela?</i>

763
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,791
What did he say?

764
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:47,628
He asked who you were.

765
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:53,667
Don't get your hopes up.

766
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:57,220
Have your boyfriend
give me those samples.

767
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,982
How'd you even know
to look for a tumor?

768
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:13,270
Well, Dr. House noticed hormone
levels in your blood,

769
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:15,906
and consulted me
as an oncologist.

770
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,358
Who cares how they found it,
okay? They found it.

771
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,160
Are there any side effects
to the treatment?

772
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:25,165
Some nausea, dizziness,
and as the tumor shrinks,

773
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:27,334
there will be
behavioral changes.

774
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:28,435
Like what?

775
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:31,421
Well...

776
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:35,008
The tumor interferes
with certain natural systems.

777
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:38,712
Um...

778
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:43,016
It lowers libido and causes
erectile dysfunction.

779
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:44,768
Eh...

780
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:47,020
Y-you mean
the treatment will,

781
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:47,971
um...

782
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:51,591
M-make me want
to have sex?

783
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,927
Wh-what if I don't
want the treatment?

784
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,529
I would strongly advise...

785
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:57,614
You have a brain tumor, okay?
You have to have the treatment.

786
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:59,783
Okay, look,
I know who I am, okay?

787
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,651
And I'm not one of them.

788
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:05,238
Hey, look, we'll adjust.
Okay?

789
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,741
We can go through
this together.

790
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,710
You mean have sex?

791
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:11,244
I can't make you do that.

792
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,279
Maybe it won't be so bad.

793
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:17,250
It'll be terrible.

794
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,936
It's actually pretty fun.

795
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:24,925
From what I remember.

796
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,394
But you said that...
I know.

797
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:32,682
I know. I wanted to spend
my life with you.

798
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:36,820
And I knew that meant
making certain sacrifices.

799
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:39,656
But a girl has needs.

800
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:47,080
You dropped in
the U.S. News rankings.

801
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:48,615
With respect,
Mr. Laffont,

802
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,700
that's only because
we temporarily shut down

803
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:51,918
our Diagnostics Department.

804
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:53,370
It's up and running again.

805
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:54,504
I'm actually concerned
it might be

806
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:55,839
because of the change
in management.

807
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:57,657
<i>If you want my money,</i>

808
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,893
<i>I'll need</i>
<i>to see a five-year plan.</i>

809
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:07,134
Am I boring you?

810
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,969
No, no, I just...

811
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,672
Those flowers
are from last week.

812
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,608
They should be
dead by now.

813
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:15,776
Excuse me?

814
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,530
Sorry. I have to go.

815
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:32,230
It's Reye's syndrome.

816
00:38:32,297 --> 00:38:33,598
Patient had
a sore throat

817
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:35,066
a few weeks ago
before he was admitted.

818
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,301
Reye's in adults
is a reach.

819
00:38:37,353 --> 00:38:38,686
Not if he took aspirin.

820
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,822
Aspirin in adults
is a reach.

821
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:43,140
Especially in a house
with locked medicine cabinets.

822
00:38:43,192 --> 00:38:44,492
Wasn't in
the medicine cabinet.

823
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:46,911
Wife used to run
a floral company.

824
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:48,496
Still does a few
orders from home.

825
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:50,532
She uses crushed aspirin
in the water

826
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:54,419
to make the flowers
last longer.

827
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:56,204
So the husband
has a sore throat,

828
00:38:56,272 --> 00:38:57,956
takes an aspirin
without her knowing,

829
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:59,924
realizes he's got a sore throat,
takes an aspirin,

830
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,292
realizes he's got
a sore throat...

831
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:03,962
Stop me whenever you like.

832
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:07,015
Have Chase start him
on steroids.

833
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:08,766
Already did.

834
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:10,835
Then why're you
telling me?

835
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:14,772
'Cause I wanted you
to hear it from me.

836
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:40,882
Oh...

837
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:46,037
There she is.

838
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:50,642
Here I am.

839
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:54,062
Your eye.

840
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:57,348
What happened?

841
00:39:57,399 --> 00:40:01,135
It's nothing
I can't handle.

842
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:17,368
MRI confirmed
macroprolactinoma.

843
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:19,504
He's doing the treatment.

844
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:20,838
And the wife?

845
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:29,681
Come on.

846
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:33,184
<i>You saved a man's life.</i>

847
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:36,754
Course-corrected two peoples'
wildly screwed-up world views.

848
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:42,727
It's not bad
for a day's work.

849
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:45,396
I think they were happy.

850
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:47,448
<i>Even if it was</i>
<i>based on lies.</i>

851
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:49,200
Most happiness is.

852
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:54,038
Better to have
schtupped and lost

853
00:40:54,106 --> 00:40:55,790
then never to have
schtupped at all.

854
00:40:55,874 --> 00:40:58,543
We can't smoke in here.

855
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:04,782
We also can't summon
people into the clinic

856
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,751
based on a lie
motivated by a petty bet.

857
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:08,886
And yet it happens.

858
00:41:08,954 --> 00:41:10,722
It's an imperfect world.

859
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:23,317
Well?

860
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:28,356
