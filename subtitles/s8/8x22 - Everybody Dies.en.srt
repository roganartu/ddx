to doing what you love.

356

Every patient

00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,535
Everybody dies.
It's meaningless.

360
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:16,570
When you solve a puzzle,
the world makes sense,

361
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:18,872
and everything
feels right.

362
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,374
And you'll always
have another one,

363
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:23,043
because people
always get sick.

364
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:24,878
It's shallow
and it's insignificant,

365
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,947
but if you don't
give a damn if idiots live,

366
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,950

give a damn about shallowness?

or where he was headed--
anything at all--

399
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:34,347
Would be a breach
of confidentiality

400
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:35,681
and a violation
of the law.

401
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:40,320
Not if he's a danger
to himself or someone else.

402

Excuse me.

What makes you think
he's a danger to himself?

He hasn't been home,

take anything with him,
not even his cell.

408
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,471
You're not saying anything,
which means

409
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:00,473
he didn't specifically
mention suicide,

410
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,008
but you came out here

411
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:06,346

Your theory
is I'm not leaving,

422
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:39,045
because I believe in God?

What,

Maybe falling through

And don't be logical.

You gotta have something

You can't live your life

you don't believe.

443
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:26,726
But you can
end your life

444
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:29,295
based on something
you don't believe?

445
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,629
What about love?

00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,798

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,767
I know you believe
in love.

448
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:42,308
Foreman wouldn't help me,

449
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,479
which means I need you
to take the fall.

450
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,197
You do remember
I'm dying, right?

451
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:51,517
Which is you will never
spend a day in jail.

Fresh-faced,
cancer-ridden.

453
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:55,755
It's tough to do both,
but you pull it off.

454
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:57,540
Your fingerprints are
all over those hockey tickets.

455
00:22:57,624 --> 00:23:00,042
I never admitted
to flushing anything.

456
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:01,294
My prints make sense

457
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:03,596
if I gave
those tickets to you

458
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:04,847
as an incentive
to stay alive.

459
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:07,433
And I was so angry
that you didn't respect

460
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,552
my dying wishes,
I took thousands of dollars

461
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,938

and flushed them down toilets?

462
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:14,891
All you have to do
is create reasonable doubt.

463
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:16,142
Great, what if I do more
than that?

464
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:17,477
What if I end up
in jail?

465
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:22,582
Or spending my final months
in endless hearings?

466
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:27,203
That is a risk
you are willing to take.

467
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:29,021
I have a reputation.

468
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:30,523
I have a legacy

00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:34,627
Wilson...

00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:37,763

00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:56,382

I'm not gonna
take the fall.

477
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,258
Don't do this
to me, Wilson.

478
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:23,676
This is
our only option.

479
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:25,545
Exactly,
because you overplayed

480
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,346
your hand with Foreman,

481
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:29,799
because you knew
you had me as a backstop.

482
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:32,585
Even with me dying,
you just assumed

483
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:33,486
I'd be here
to bail you out.

484
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:35,471
Since you're here,

485
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:36,689
and you are
bailing me out,

486
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:40,226
seems like
a pretty safe assumption.

487
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:43,563
Hey!

488
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:45,615
I won't be here soon.

489
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,266
If I do this,
I'm teaching you

490
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:49,485
that your bad behavior
will always be rewarded.

491
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,769
You need to learn--

492
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:52,822
How to act
when you're gone?

493
00:24:52,906 --> 00:24:54,156
'Cause if that's
the lesson,

494
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,608
we got a really great
opportunity coming up.

495
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:56,909
You'll just try
to find someone else,

496
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,128
and it won't work,
and it shouldn't work!

497
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:01,447
So that's the great wisdom
you're imparting?

498
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,199
That I'll always
be alone?

499
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,719
There's only one person
you can count on.

500
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:11,374
I thought
there were two.

501
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:17,346
I need to do this...

502
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:20,683
for you.

503
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:30,359
Wilson's right.

504
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,078
<i>He's always right.</i>

505
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:34,363
<i>He's always been</i>
<i>your good side.</i>

506
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:37,250
I always wondered
why I photographed so poorly.

507
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:40,002
And because he's always
played that role,

508
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:43,422
you've never had to develop
a conscience of your own.

509
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,874
People don't change.

510
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:48,094
Consciences don't
spontaneously develop.

511
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:52,348
You're wrong, Greg.

512
00:25:52,432 --> 00:25:54,517
Which is...

513
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:56,435
why you'll be
better off without him.

514
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:00,839
You've been
looking to him

515
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:04,694

gotta find within yourself.

516
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:09,749
Something you <i>can</i> find.

00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:31,387
Hold your child.

518
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:50,189
This is a reason to die.

519
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,524
This is what
my life could've been,

520
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:53,075
not what it can be.

521
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,193
<i>If it could've been,</i>

522
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:59,165
you're capable of it now.

523
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:01,751
You're married.
Cuddy's gone.

524
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:04,170
We aren't the only two people
who could love you.

525
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,132
Why settle so easily?

526
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:23,189
These are
just idiotic fantasies...

527
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:26,025
Greg, don't.

528
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:29,145
At odds with every
logical bone in my body.

529
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:30,929
Get up.

530
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,432
You do not
have to die in here!
