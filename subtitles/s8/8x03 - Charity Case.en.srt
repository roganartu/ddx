00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,013
Rebuttal.

182

What's your
evil plan?

183
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,968
I object to your cynicism.

184
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:18,970
- It's been earned.
- <i>That's what I object to.</i>

185
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,772
The new Dean of Medicine
has an ethical obligation

186
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,390
to come in with
a completely open mind

187

for at least four weeks.

190
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,814

<i>to convince him</i>
<i>that you saved his life,</i>

192
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,618

193
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:35,370
- What?
- Your old team?

194
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:36,604

195

<i>This is your new reality.</i>

You've got your office.

197

You've got neighbors.

198
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,377
You've got one employee,
one volunteer.

They're willing

What about Thirteen?

204
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,419
Not a good choice.

205
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,790

207
00:07:58,677 --> 00:07:59,844

00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,799

shut me up already.

You've got
two choices, House.

220
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:29,290
You can recognize
that your patient

221
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,842
is just a very nice,
healthy guy,

222
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:32,126
and send him home,

223
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:34,879
or you can consider
altruism a symptom.

224
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:36,831
In which case,
you cannot take his money.

225
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:44,439
Send him home.

226
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:45,673
And check with admitting

227
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,442

of all new patients.

231

00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,254
I'm putting the band
back together.

233
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,506
Interesting that you
never showed up at my place,

234
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,807

of annoying me

235

to take no for an answer.

No, you wanna like boring.

But if you actually
liked boring,

I will choose
to listen to your actions

262
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,378

No, I mean your running
a test and discharging me.

268
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:48,813
I think so.

269
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:50,848

of caution,

00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:16,361
Saying no will cause
both of us pain.

361
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:18,464
Saying yes will cause
both of us pleasure.

362
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,900
You can't take sex
from a sexaholic.

363
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,868
You can't give booze
to an alcoholic,

364
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,720
and you can't
take this guy's money.

365
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,005
Could be wrong
about the symptom.

366
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:27,590
I'm wrong all the time.

367
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:28,808
<i>Taking money</i>
<i>from a sick person</i>

368
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,143
is ethically suspect
at best.

369
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:32,478
<i>What is this, Canada?</i>

370
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,713
All we do is take money
from sick people.

371
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:35,681
We work for it.

372
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,016
I'm working!

373
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,317
How much?

374
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:40,653
$20.

375
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:42,888
<i>Well, what if it was?</i>

376
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:44,490
<i>It's the same principle.</i>

377
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:46,625
$20, $1 million...
What's the difference?

378
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:50,329
Actually, the difference
is pretty much $1 million.

379
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:52,248
He came up
with the figure, not me.

380
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:53,466
[Beeping]

381
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:54,750
Crap.

382
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:58,604
Got a patient with
end stage renal disease.

383
00:14:58,672 --> 00:14:59,922
<i>Her heart can't</i>
<i>support dialysis.</i>

384
00:15:00,006 --> 00:15:02,091
She needs a transplant,
but...

385
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:03,909
you tuned out as soon as it
stopped being about you,

386
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,244
didn't you?

387
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,745
- What?
- I gotta go.

388
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:08,180
It's all moot.

389
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:10,132
Patient probably
has long QT.

390
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:13,219
Probably just a really,
really decent person.

391
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:14,470
They exist, right?

392
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:15,855
You can't take
the money, House.

393
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,290
<i>(Benjamin)</i>
<i>Is long QT bad?</i>

394
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,229
It's a tough thing
to control.

395
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,347
Is there someone
you want me to call?

396
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,268
There's someone
I would like to call.

397
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:31,770
She's the same person
who won't take my calls.

398
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:34,607
My wife.

399
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:40,212
When I started giving away
the money, I--

400
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,747
I hoped she'd want
to do it with me.

401
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:43,849
She didn't.

402
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:47,837
I miss them.

403
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,840
I have two little boys.

404
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:56,195
Having a family
doesn't exempt me

405
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:57,630
from social responsibility.

406
00:15:57,697 --> 00:15:59,398
But family comes first.

407
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:01,400
It should.

408
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:04,336
I know that
sounds weird, but...

409
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:05,637
someone who's
related to you,

410
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:08,140
does that empirically
make them more special?

411
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,909
More deserving than
anyone else?

412
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:12,545
Yes, it gives you
a responsibility.

413
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:14,947
My boys have a roof
over their heads.

414
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,498
They're not starving.

415
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:21,787
I pay court-ordered
child support,

416
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:23,756
and, frankly, it's, uh...

417
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:25,858
more than they need.

418
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:29,328
I love them more
than anything, I just...

419
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:31,380
I can't justify
buying video games

420
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:32,681
and private schools

421
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,466
when other people's children
are starving.

422
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:39,538
I hope, one day,
they'll understand that.

423
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:43,392
Your hands are trembling.

424
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:44,676
Is it the electrodes?

425
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:45,728
Are you in pain?

426
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,279
No.

427
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:48,981
What's happening?

428
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,849
I'm not sure, but it's not
what we thought it was.

429
00:16:53,502 --> 00:16:54,702
So...

430
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:58,171
arrhythmia, fainting,
muscle tremors.

431
00:16:58,196 --> 00:16:59,396
Plus, unfortunately,
mental changes.

432
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:07,469
I still don't think
it's neurological.

433
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:09,469
God bless you.

434
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:10,856
He lost his wife and kids
because she couldn't

435
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,373
stop giving money away.

436
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:13,949
He lost his wife
because she couldn't

437
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:15,544
accept not being
filthy rich.

438
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,551
She's not drinking
the coffee either.

439
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:19,949
Drink it, don't drink it.

440
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,451
The point is,
I gave it to you,

441
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:22,785
so we're even.

442
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:25,071
Even?

443
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:26,355
It was a gift.

444
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:27,624
An insignificant token.

445
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:29,025
There was nothing owed.

446
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:30,660
That was the whole point.

447
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,644
Why?

448
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:33,362
Why?

449
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:34,864
Yeah, why?

450
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:37,250
She's the crazy one.

451
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:41,421
So a guy gives everything
away to strangers: Sane.

452
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:45,208
Girl who doesn't want anything
from a stranger is crazy.

453
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,709
You're not a stranger.

454
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,478
And your perverse
view of the world

455
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:50,246
is making you force
a neurological component

456
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,348
onto an obviously
cardiological--

457
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,766
Your parents
didn't love you enough.

458
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,436
So you need to prove
your superiority.

459
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Or they love you
too much,

460
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,772
so you need
to prove your humility.

461
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:02,025
Or it's just rich guilt.

462
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:03,276
I'm betting on the last one.

463
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:07,947
There's a whole list
of drugs

464
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:09,332
that could have
caused his symptoms.

465
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:11,084
I doubt the guy
would spend money on drugs

466
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:12,252
when there are
orphans out there

467
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:13,419
without cable.

468
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:14,938
Anyway, he'd be
getting better right now,

469
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:16,105
not worse.

470
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:18,241
Could be
polyarteritis nodosa.

471
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,743
That comes with a rash.

472
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:23,046
Echovirus.

473
00:18:23,097 --> 00:18:24,514
[Echoing] Virus, virus,
virus, virus...

474
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,516
Fits his physical symptoms.

475
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,184
And could,

476
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:30,203
but doesn't necessarily
cause personality changes.

477
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:32,972
Works for everyone?

478
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:35,591
Start him on antivirals.

479
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:37,443
And, Adams...

480
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:38,611
when you treat,

481
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:40,096
and he gets better,

482
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:42,431
and doesn't give Bob Cratchit
Christmas day off,

483
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:43,650

It was a two-for-one sale.
I couldn't resist.

I need to justify
buying them.

539
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:40,600
I can't pay you back.

540
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:42,185
The first pair were $120.

541
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:44,103
These...were free.

542
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:47,323
You do know I punched

543
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:48,791
the last person
that pissed me off?

544
00:20:50,444 --> 00:20:51,527
Was it Santa?

545
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:10,413
What's your
patient's status?

546
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,781
Better.

547
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:13,216
We're discharging him.

548
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:14,717
[Sighs]
Good.

549
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,804
Hey, hey, hey.

550
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,856
Why do you care?

551
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:21,257
Specifically.

552
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:23,393
Although I'm curious
about a general answer too.

553
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:25,561
Your guy just signed up
to donate a kidney

554
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:27,130
to my patient
with renal failure.

555
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,401
Did he meet your patient
with renal failure?

556
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:33,820
No, he heard the nurses
talking about her,

557
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:35,371
that she was short
on time.

558
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:38,458
I was wrong.

559
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,775
Don't say that.

560
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:42,128
House, she really
needs this kidney.

561
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:43,713
He's not better.

562
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,131
His mental status
is declining.

563
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:47,500
Or he's doing
an amazing thing

564
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,385
for another human being.

565
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:50,837
I thought it was
an ethical no-brainer

566
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:53,172
that we can't take stuff
from sick people.

567
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:55,508
I changed my mind.

568
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:04,027
He's still sick.

569
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:05,278
His symptoms
have gone away.

570
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:06,730
Not all of them.

571
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:08,448
Offering an organ
to a stranger

572
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:09,783
<i>is</i> a symptom.

573
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:10,900
A couple dozen
people a year

574
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,485
make undirected
kidney donations.

575
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,070
Yeah, how many of them
are also in the process

576
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:15,455
of pauperizing themselves?

577
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,990
If the guy threw himself
on a grenade,

578
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:18,158
he'd be a hero.

579
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:20,126
If it saves a life,
who cares?

580
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:21,461
You do!

581
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:24,914
Yesterday, when you made
the exact opposite argument.

582
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:26,800
If there's even
a chance I'm right,

583
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:28,885
it'd be dangerous to give
his kidney to someone else.

584
00:22:28,952 --> 00:22:30,620
More dangerous than
complete renal failure?

585
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:31,972
My patient needs this.

586
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,139
Now.

587
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:34,891
Why do you wanna
give away your kidney?

588
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,677
There are 70,000 people
in this country

589
00:22:37,762 --> 00:22:39,029
on the active waiting list
for a kidney,

590
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,497
and less than 10,000
dead people a year

591
00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:41,631
to give them one.

592
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:42,899
Yeah.

593
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:44,934
If only we could kill
60,000 more people a year,

594
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:46,403
all would be golden.

595
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,404
I'll give you
your money.

596
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:49,489
See? Crazy.

597
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:51,140
Being a live donor
has risks.

598
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:52,375
I looked it up.

599
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:53,710
The risk is 1 in 4,000

600
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:54,811
I could die
during surgery,

601
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:57,080
which means,
if I don't donate,

602
00:22:57,148 --> 00:22:59,449
I'm valuing my life
at 4,000 times someone else's.

603
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:02,168
<i>It's not like</i>
<i>I want to be</i>

604
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:03,553
cut open and have a part
of me taken out.

605
00:23:03,621 --> 00:23:06,389
But I've got two,
and this woman has none.

606
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:07,924
She'll die without it.

607
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:10,627
Perfectly logical.

608
00:23:10,678 --> 00:23:13,063
People with mental deficiency
can be logical.

609
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,881
Just like sane people
can be illogical.

610
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:16,433
This kidney thing is
the only evidence you have

611
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,467
that he's sick.

612
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:21,337
I'm gonna let him
be a donor.

613
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:27,510
<i>Dr. House,</i>

614
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:30,013
it's not a symptom.

615
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:32,048
Come back after you're
convinced that I'm healthy,

616
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:33,950
and I will
give you your money.

617
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:35,902
No, you won't.

618
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,909
We have time
for one more test

619
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:44,077
before we move him.

620
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:45,211
What test?

621
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:46,329
Whatever test will prove

622
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,531
there was
an echovirus-irus-irus,

623
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:50,550
and he's not cured,
obviously.

624
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:52,385
I've been saying all along
this could be Whipple's.

625
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,471
Causes arrhythmia,
tremor,

626
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:56,372
and mental changes.

627
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:57,757
Bad idea.

628
00:23:57,842 --> 00:23:59,041
There's no joint pain.

629
00:23:59,093 --> 00:24:00,427
Where's Adams?

630
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:01,878
We thought
the case was over.

631
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:02,879
She has a job interview.

632
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:09,519
Why is she here?

633
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,187
<i>'Cause I called her.</i>

634
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:14,357
Bigger question
is why that worked.

635
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:15,825
I'm here because
I have time

636
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:16,893
and you have
a crisis and I--

637
00:24:16,944 --> 00:24:18,695
we're too busy
for rationalizations.

638
00:24:18,746 --> 00:24:21,331
Patient made a big downgrade
in his personal life.

639
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:22,916
He's probably not
eating all that healthy.

640
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,701
Magnesium deficiency?

641
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:28,788
<i>Wait until they take him</i>
<i>back to his room--draw blood,</i>

642
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:31,091
do an expanded
electrolyte profile.

643
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:32,175
<i>No, he hasn't had</i>

644
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:33,710
anxiety or any
trouble sleeping.

645
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:34,928
I think it's
Whipple's disease.

646
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:37,413
Bad idea.
He doesn't have joint pain.

647
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:39,132
<i>Joint pain is common,</i>
<i>but not definitive.</i>

648
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:41,084
<i>Whipple's explains</i>
<i>all of his symptoms,</i>

649
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:43,252
<i>including</i>
<i>the personality change.</i>

650
00:24:43,304 --> 00:24:44,754
And it would respond
to antibiotics,

651
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:46,272
which is why
he started to feel better.

652
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:47,941
Which doesn't mean
he's not still sick.

653
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:49,142
You were right.

654
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:52,094
Counts for nothing
if you can't defend it.

655
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:54,314
Book a procedure room.

656
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:57,901
Do an upper endoscopy and run
a PCR test for Whipple's.

657
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:01,504
Guilt.

658
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,208
You feel guilty
about leaving.

659
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:06,543
<i>Yes, I think</i>
<i>that little of you</i>

660
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,544
and that much of me.

661
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:08,795
You're nothing without me.

662
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:09,946
<i>Not leaving me.</i>

663
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:11,414
Leaving humanity.

664
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:14,217
I'm going
with my girlfriend.

665
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:15,718
The woman I love.

666
00:25:15,786 --> 00:25:16,953
To have fun.

667
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:20,173
You're trying to make me
feel guilty

668
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,558
because you're
saving lives here.

669
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,959
And I think that's great.

670
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,427
I'm proud to have
been a part of it,

671
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:27,480
but...now...

672
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:28,648
I just wanna be happy.

673
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:32,769
Oh...no one's
unhappy in Greece.

674
00:25:36,524 --> 00:25:38,575
<i>It just appeared</i>
<i>in the last few weeks.</i>

675
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,827
<i>He's having trouble</i>
<i>holding a pencil in school.</i>

676
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:41,778
Does it itch?

677
00:25:44,248 --> 00:25:45,665
Do anything different
lately?

678
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:48,501
You get a new baseball
glove, a new kitten?

679
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:49,919
Well, the neighbors
put in a pool,

680
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:51,487
so he's been spending
a lot of time over there.

681
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,706
But, well, if it was
something in the water,

682
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:55,625
it would be everywhere,
wouldn't it?

683
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:01,998
It is in the water.

684
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:03,299
He's allergic to chlorine?

685
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,134
No...

686
00:26:05,186 --> 00:26:06,219
[Inhales deeply]

687
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:09,022
He's allergic to
summer lilac.

688
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:11,057
That's my lotion.

689
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:12,775
And it's not in the pool.

690
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:15,712
No, it's on the palms
of his hands.

691
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,615
In the pool
is the neighbor's daughter.

692
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:22,318
Or the neighbor's hot wife.

693
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:28,374
Here's some lube.

694
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:31,878
Sorry.
Too late for your eyesight.

695
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:44,090
Endoscopy didn't reveal
any lesions

696
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:45,425
in the small intestine.

697
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:48,728
I'm running PCR test now.

698
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:52,232
Found it in my office.

699
00:26:52,316 --> 00:26:54,383
Appears to be a gift.

700
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:55,351
That can't be good.

701
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:58,004
Damn it.

702
00:26:58,072 --> 00:27:00,073
You got her
the job interview.

703
00:27:00,157 --> 00:27:01,324
And that was supposed
to be the end of it.

704
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:03,576
I...don't take charity.

705
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:05,528
Good for you!
You loon.

706
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:07,730
I don't like
owing people things.

707
00:27:07,781 --> 00:27:10,166
So either
you're so insecure

708
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:12,502
that you feel like you need
to always have the upper hand,

709
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:13,786
or you're so arrogant

710
00:27:13,871 --> 00:27:16,122
that the notion of a favor
is insulting to you.

711
00:27:16,206 --> 00:27:17,340
Or it's your family,

712
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:19,509
some kind of
immigrant pride thing.

713
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:21,577
I'm betting
on the last one.

714
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:23,129
I just don't like it.

715
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:26,749
It makes me feel...Icky.

716
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,102
That's the reason?
