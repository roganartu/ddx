Very interesting practice
you must've run.

351
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,698
No need for tests.

352
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,333
No need for proof.

353
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,401
<i>Where are you going?</i>

354
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:30,586
To the proof store.

355
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,210
You were right
about Nicole.

356
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,913
About me not caring?
I thought so.

357
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:45,050
It wasn't her mom.
It was her.

358
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,885
She doesn't wanna
talk to me.

359
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,920
Listen, I'm trying to
listen to your lungs,

360
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:50,689
not your self-pity.

361
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,059
Cancer can wait.

362
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,861
Hey, heading out
to the yard?

363
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,095
Mm-hmm.

364
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,982
You mind trying
to find me a cricket?

365
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,234
The ol' swap trick?

366
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,070
You don't think that will
piss off your cellie even more

367
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,822
when he figures
it's a different bug?

368
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,825
I'll dress 'em the same,
like in <i>Vertigo.</i>

369
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,662
Well, I'll try, but they
spray so much pesticide

370
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:16,114
I'm surprised we're alive.

371
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,586
Good point.

372
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,807
Hey.
How's it coming?

373
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,225
It ain't.

374
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,227
The confederates be giving
themselves spankin' new tats.

375
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,062
They putting a claim
on all of my Vicodin.

376
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,630
Now, I love you and all,
my brother,

377
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,298
but not as much
as I love my gang

378
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,484
of crazy, roided-out
Nazi bitches.

379
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,058
<i>Turn to an inch</i>
<i>to the left.</i>

380
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,248
<i>Hear</i>
<i>the difference?</i>

381
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,649
Yeah!

382
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,334
It's called
an acoustical shadow.

383
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,819
<i>It means</i>
<i>he's got a tumor.</i>

384
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,621
How did you find that
without a stethoscope?

385
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,356
I didn't even know
you could do this!

386
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,058
Start
the blood thinners.

387
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,626
So I for sure
got lung cancer?

388
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:01,677
- No.
- Yeah.

389
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,630
<i>All you've proven</i>

390
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,048
is there's an anomaly
in his chest.

391
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,182
Which means
your initial diagnosis

392
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,333
could still be right.

393
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:09,985
Which apparently
really bugs you.

394
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:16,108
I could do
a clotting test.

395
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,678
That's...

396
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,281
That's a good idea.

397
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,615
<i>We're just gonna cut</i>
<i>your earlobe a bit</i>

398
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,951
<i>and check back</i>
<i>in two minutes.</i>

399
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,570
If there's a little blood
bubbling up, that's normal.

400
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,907
But if it's
completely clotted,

401
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,359
it may indicate cancer.

402
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:36,712
Okay? Ready?

403
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:01,520
Are you really
leaving medicine?

404
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:04,239
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

405
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,243
You know, for someone

406
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,079
who asks as many favors
as you do,

407
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,898
you sure don't make
any effort

408
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:14,616
to win me over.

409
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,005
Before I went
to med school,

410
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,926
I thought about getting
a Ph.D. in physics.

411
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,044
You ever heard of
dark matter?

412
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,965
<i>The way galaxies rotate,</i>
<i>the motion of the Universe,</i>

413
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,584
it means there's
six times more stuff

414
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:34,586
than we can detect.

415
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,138
But it's theorized.

416
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:39,024
No one's ever proved
it exists.

417
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,993
So you wanna
research it?

418
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,144
<i>Why?</i>

419
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,780
It's the greatest
mystery there is--

420
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,665
the theory
of everything.

421
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,901
And completely divorced
from humanity.

422
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:51,069
Well,
me and humanity,

423
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,988
we got together
too young.

424
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,042
Tsk.
You have a gift.

425
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,212
<i>There is something</i>
<i>in this world</i>

426
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,347
you are
undeniably great at.

427
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,416
<i>You can read people.</i>

428
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:07,302
<i>You--</i>
<i>you understand them.</i>

429
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,354
You gotta go back
to medicine.

430
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,393
Well, if that gift is related
to what brought me here,

431
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,030
you'll understand if I wanna
check the returns policy.

432
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,464
<i>Hey!</i>

433
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:22,184
Is this supposed
to happen?

434
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,357
Cool.

435
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:43,708
Jiminy didn't chirp much
last night.

436
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:47,212
If it's a disease,
then he's six inches under.

437
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,749
But this could also
be pesticide poisoning...

438
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:55,086
Which bicarbonate of soda
has been used to treat.

439
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:57,756
See?

440
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:01,009
Just so much
and no more.

441
00:24:10,403 --> 00:24:12,904
Mm...

442
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:22,080
This is where
you say "thank you."

443
00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:25,834
Or I say thank you

444
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:28,019
for not killing me.

445
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:35,210
Thank you.

446
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,170

447
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:59,851
Hey.

448
00:24:59,902 --> 00:25:02,687
The X-ray didn't show
any tumors.

449
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:05,356
The acoustical shadow
was just a lipoma.

450
00:25:05,408 --> 00:25:07,542
I'm thinking--
you all right?

451
00:25:07,627 --> 00:25:09,360
I'm fine.

452
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:10,912
Ibuprofen?

453
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:12,714
That's not gonna help.

454
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:24,175
You can look
at the patient file

455
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:25,644
if you want.

456
00:25:25,711 --> 00:25:27,712
You trust me?

457
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:29,547
Any reason I shouldn't?

458
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,566
You're really not good
at reading people, are you?

459
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:32,717
Or buildings.

460
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:34,319
People are complicated.

461
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:36,104
And people change.

462
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:37,555
Not that much
to the first,

463
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:39,223
and not at all
to the second.

464
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:40,775
But if it'll
get me the file...

465
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,627
If we add "clotting disorder"
to the symptoms,

466
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:43,895
it's gotta be a toxin.

467
00:25:43,946 --> 00:25:45,563
This guy's the only one
with symptoms.

468
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:47,198
It's either gotta be his cell
or his work station.

469
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:48,399
The laundry room.

470
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:51,119
So maybe a solvent
or detergent?

471
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:54,539
Can you get me an escort
to gather samples?

472
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,207
Dr. Adams.

Why did you lie to me
about what you were in for?

00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,776
<i>They're gonna charge you</i>
<i>with extra crimes.</i>

707
00:40:38,843 --> 00:40:41,178
You'll be here
six more months, minimum!

708
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:43,981
Sorry. Distracted.
You were saying?

709
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,566
<i>I checked your file.</i>
<i>You didn't have a bad lawyer.</i>

710
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,318
You had no lawyer.

711
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:49,119
<i>You took the first deal</i>
<i>they offered you,</i>

712
00:40:49,187 --> 00:40:51,489
because you wanted
to punish yourself.

713
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,990
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>getting beaten up,</i>

714
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,125
you think saving this one guy
will wipe your slate clean?

715
00:40:55,193 --> 00:40:56,577
No.

716
00:40:56,661 --> 00:40:57,995
Then why are you
doing this?

717
00:40:58,046 --> 00:40:59,380
'Cause I have a gift.

718
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:02,383
Once you drink this,

719
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:04,301
should get an attack
almost immediately.

720
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:05,636
<i>That is, if I'm right.</i>

721
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:07,638
<i>Just bought yourself</i>
<i>months in solitary.</i>

722
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:08,756
Was it really worth it?

723
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,509
If I'm wrong, no,
it wasn't.

724
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,143
<i>(Sykes)</i>
<i>No! No! No! Get the cup!</i>

725
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:14,261
<i>Get the cup!</i>

726
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,596
Just drink it!
Drink it!

727
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,714
<i>(Sykes)</i>
<i>No! Grab the cup!</i>

728
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:21,569
<i>(Hsueh)</i>
<i>Hands behind your back.</i>

729
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:24,188
What were you
thinking?

730
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,275
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I--I was scared.</i>

731
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:38,402
No!

732
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:39,587
<i>You're fired.</i>

733
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:41,622
You're beyond fired.

734
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:44,592
You're completely
unhireable anywhere.

735
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:46,076
You understand that?

736
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:48,846
Yes.

737
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:51,015
Now shut up and let's see
if he has an attack.

738
00:42:10,268 --> 00:42:13,604
<i>(House) Come on, just</i>
<i>a little more time.</i>

739
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,611
<i>(Sykes)</i>
<i>Get him out of here.</i>
