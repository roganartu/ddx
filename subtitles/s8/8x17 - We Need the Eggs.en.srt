00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:08,310
<i>Keep breathing.</i>

2
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:10,362
<i>Nice and slow.</i>

3
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:14,266
Now, the first
couple of shots

4
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:15,534
will show you
if the sights are off

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,902
or the barrel's bent.

6
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:18,370
Let me make this
real easy for you.

7
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,873
The sights are off
and the barrel's bent.

8
00:00:24,794 --> 00:00:27,379
Mm, you're off
to the left about an inch.

9
00:00:27,447 --> 00:00:30,249
That's it.
Shoot around the star.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,500
Not at it.

11
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:35,804
Yes!
Yeah! You did it!

12
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:39,475
<i>I</i> didn't.

13
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,626
You just won your girlfriend
a Teddy bear.

14
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:44,963
Cool. Hey, which one
you think she'd like best?

15
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:50,853
And then Thursday night,
this physicist

16
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:52,905
is giving a lecture
in Brooklyn.

17
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:56,158
It's about time travel
and the grandfather paradox.

18
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:57,526
I don't know
if you're busy...

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,446
Okay, Henry.
Henry...Um...

20
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,114
Can we talk for a second?

21
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:03,449
Yeah.

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,666
I'm really happy
that we've been

23
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:06,035
hanging out so much.

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,337
Yeah, I--
I like you too. Heh.

25
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,956
Can you put down the bear?

26
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:17,880
Henry...

27
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:19,598
What?

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,003
I can't.

29
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:27,022
I know.

30
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:29,141
You have a girlfriend.

31
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:30,392
It's just...

32
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,111
She never seems...

33
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:35,531
to want to do anything
with you.

34
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:38,150
Are you crying?

35
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,518
No, I have allergies.

36
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,487
I must just be,
like, tearing up.

37
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:43,822
Henry, I think
that's blood.

38
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:46,325
What? I--it...

39
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:47,743

How long are you gonna be
using the office for sex games?

56

I'm not a savage.

59
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:00,122
I asked for a cappuccino.

60
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:01,391
That's what this is.

61
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,776
No, a cappuccino's got
a nice, stiff foam on it.

62
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:04,977
<i>This is wetter than...</i>

63
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:08,815

00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:09,932
<i>Well, thank you,</i>

65
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,067
Ms. Scotch,

66
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:12,735
but poor foaming's
a deal breaker.

67
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:15,071
Could you ask the next
candidate to come in?

68
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:17,490
Initial exam showed
no sign of trauma

69
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:19,308
<i>or subconjunctival</i>
<i>hemorrhage.</i>

70
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,693
<i>Lymphocytosis?</i>

71
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:22,362
ALC's in normal range,

72
00:03:22,446 --> 00:03:23,646
<i>but it's in the high end</i>
<i>of normal.</i>

73
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,331
Take a seat, Fawn.

74
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:29,118
And tell me, what's your
favorite Woody Allen movie?

75
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:33,339
<i>Annie Hall.</i>

76
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:34,457
You're interviewing hookers

77
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:36,209
but not gonna
talk to them about sex?

78
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:37,260
Sex is a given.

79
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:38,378
They're hookers.

80
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:40,113
Defend your choice.

81
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,014
It's the most popular.

82
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,400
Ohh...that's so close.

83
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:46,386
We would have accepted,
"Diane Keaton looks great

84
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,971
in suits," or,
"it's a trenchant commentary

85
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,340
on today's mores,"
or, "I needed the eggs."

86
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:54,277
Thanks for your interest.

87
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:56,479

that I find useful/entertaining

90
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,238
for the remaining 57 minutes
of the hour I paid for.

91
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:07,407
Lymphocytosis works.

92
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:09,625
Maybe we should take
another look at the blood.

93
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:12,161
Could also be
cavernous sinus thrombosis.

94
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,963
Clot builds up pressure
at the base of the brain.

95
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:15,381
Rerun the patient's
blood panel

96
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:17,199
and get a CT venogram
of his head.

97
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:20,970
Let's see which one of you
is right.

98
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:24,340
How are you
with small appliance repair?

99
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:27,042
Uh, this cavernous sinus thing,

100
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:28,344
is it dangerous?

101
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:29,562
If Henry's got it,

102
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:30,613
<i>we can treat it</i>
<i>with a combo</i>

103
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,482
of drugs and surgery.

104
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:35,101
Success rate
is over 70%.

105
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:36,519
Do you want me
to call Amy again?

106
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,221
No, it's fine.

107
00:04:39,273 --> 00:04:41,407
Amy's his girlfriend.

108
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:43,526
I'm the neighbor.

109
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:45,611
<i>I did leave a message</i>
<i>at their number.</i>

110
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:47,079
<i>Do you wanna</i>
<i>try her cell?</i>

111
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:49,499
Be here for a few
more hours at least.

112
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,400
Oh, she doesn't have one.
She worries about radiation.

113
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:53,085
<i>I could stop by</i>
<i>on my way home.</i>

114
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,455
She knows
who I am, right?

115
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:57,573
<i>You don't need to,</i>
<i>but thanks.</i>

116
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:00,793
Good luck.

117
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:02,044
Okay.

118
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,383
<i>Have you ever paid for sex?</i>

119
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:09,385
Every guy who's ever seen
a Merchant Ivory movie

120
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,987
has paid for sex.

121
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:12,939
No.

122
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:14,857
It just...

123
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:17,293
seems too demeaning
to women.

124
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:18,761
Given the things you've
done to women,

125
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:21,531
that seems arbitrary.

126
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:23,265
You're Chi Park, right?

127
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:25,201
Who's asking?

128
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:27,269
Uh, you called about
my guitar flyer.

129
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:29,322
You're Micah.
This guy's selling

130
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:32,441
a 1974 Gibson SG
standard in tobacco

131
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:33,709
for $1,250.

132
00:05:33,777 --> 00:05:34,777
<i>Yeah, actually,</i>
<i>I came in to tell you</i>

133
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,145
I already sold it.

134
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,279
Sorry.

135
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,581
Oh, um...

136
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:39,799
Thanks anyway.

137
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:48,191
Blood panel results
seem pretty much the same

138
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:50,359
as before,
and that guy likes you.

139
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,428
Maybe we should check
for diabetes.

140
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:53,863
Could weaken
conjunctival vessels.

141
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:55,014
And shut up.

142
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:57,800
If I'm wrong,
then why is he coming back?

143
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:01,303
My band is rehearsing
tomorrow night.

144
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:03,272
You should come by
and jam with us.

145
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:05,975
That...sounds fun.

146
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:07,994
I'll think about it.

147
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:09,829
Great. Call me.

148
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:14,367
Park has a boyfriend.

149
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:16,052
I'll break your face.

150
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:25,678
This is the talent portion
of the interview.

151
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:26,662
<i>Okay.</i>

152
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:28,464
You like cards.

153
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:30,499
<i>But you can juggle.</i>

154
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:32,268
I fail to see how this would be
of benefit to you.

155
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:34,020
What if I'm busy?

156
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,170
Have you got anything else?

157
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:36,672
Sure.

158
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:43,980
CT showed no clots
or malformations.

159
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:47,349
Park and Taub ruled out
lymphocytosis and diabetes.

160
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:49,235
Well, since you have
nothing of relevance

161
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,571
to report, I assume
that you're here

162
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:53,739
to toss your panties
in the ring.

163
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:54,890
<i>Patient's got</i>
<i>a mysterious girlfriend</i>

164
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,158
<i>he really wants to see.</i>

165
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,377
She's unreachable by phone,

166
00:06:58,462 --> 00:06:59,378
<i>and the neighbor's</i>
<i>never even seen her.</i>

167
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:00,763
What do you think?

168
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:03,049
He's gay.

169
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,351
I think he's a junkie.

170
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,069
The girlfriend is a fix.

171
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:09,005
<i>The guy's inhaling glue.</i>

172
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:10,539
Can you repair a blender?

173
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,425
Can you bite me?

174
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,043
Go search the patient's home.

175
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:19,348
Well, thank you, ladies.

176
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,268
I've seen a lot of very
talented candidates.

177
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:24,053
Got a tough decision
the next few days.

178
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,023
This is the part I hate.

179
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:45,541
Well...this is not
exactly a crack den.

180
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:48,410
Doesn't exactly look like
a woman lives here, either.

181
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,181
"To Amy.

182
00:07:52,248 --> 00:07:54,417
I love you."

183
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:56,418
Okay. She exists.

184
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,222
Doesn't mean
he's not a drug addict.

185
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:02,475
It's good you're playing it
cool with House.

186
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,809
<i>Once he gets a rise</i>
<i>out of someone...</i>

187
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:05,394
Yeah, I'm not crazy about
the whole hooker thing,

188
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:06,428
but I get it.

189
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,897
Other than the fact

190
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:09,899
that it's exploitative
and dangerous for women,

191
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,035
you get what you need without
any of the emotional baggage.

192
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,655
You're not seeing
anyone, I take it.

193
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:17,940
I've been volunteering
at the Trenton Free Clinic.

194
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:19,241
Keeps me busy.

195
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:22,294
You volunteer every night
and every weekend?

196
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,796
No time to grab dinner?

197
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,164
What's more important--

198
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:26,916
making small talk
over ravioli

199
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:29,451
<i>or helping people</i>
<i>who are less fortunate?</i>

200
00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:30,503
With that rationale,

201
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:31,787
none of us
should ever eat again.

202
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,623
Let's just say
I'm not hungry right now.

203
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,096
Oh, God...

204
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:42,148
I don't think
she's breathing.

205
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:44,684
Do you think
she OD'd?

206
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,185
That or he killed her.

207
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:47,169
Pulse?

208
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:52,141
No.

209
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:53,359
I'll call the coroner.

210
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:55,661
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

211
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:01,150
This one works
in financial district.

212
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:02,952
She can get tips,
give you leg up in market.

213
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:06,288
What is "fudgey Gonzalez"?

214
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:10,376
Uh, imagine
a "vanilla Gonzalez,"

215
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,495
but from the other side.

216
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,171
I'm about to make
a decision,

217
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:24,506
but there's still time for you
to sneak under the wire.

218
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:25,691
My favorite
Woody Allen movie

219
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:26,909
is <i>Melinda and Melinda.</i>

220
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:30,012
<i>Our patient is not a junkie,</i>

221
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:32,615
but he does have a girlfriend.

222
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,726
I call her my "girlfriend"
because people understand that.

223
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:41,342
If I explained it,

224
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:42,944
they'd just think
I was a weirdo.

225
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:46,347
We're not here
to judge anyone's fetish.

226
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:47,398
I'm not a pervert.

227
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:49,484
It's not like
I'm more attracted

228
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,486
to dolls than humans.

229
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:53,237
So you don't have sex
with her?

230
00:09:54,656 --> 00:09:56,374
It's not just about that.

231
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,944
Does the doll talk to you?

232
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:02,413
I know she's not
a real person.

233
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:04,999
In a lot of ways,
she's better than a person.

234
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,251
<i>I can tell her things,</i>
<i>and she won't</i>

235
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,703
argue with me
or make fun of me.

236
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,372
I come home every night,

237
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:13,141
and I know
she'll be there waiting.

238
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,776
So is your toaster.

239
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,380
No one in the world
has an emotional attachment

240
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:21,182
to a toaster.

241
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:24,152
But a lot of people
are willing to spend $7,000

242
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:26,521
<i>on women like Amy.</i>

243
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:28,606
Have you ever tried
an actual--

244
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,274
<i>Yeah, I'm 35.</i>

245
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:34,162
I've been in relationships.
Just none of them fulfilled me.

246
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:36,030
And one day,
I saw this website,

247
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:40,401
and...maybe the perfect woman's
out there somewhere,

248
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:43,888
but it's not worth
going through

249
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,707
<i>what it would take</i>
<i>to find her.</i>

250
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,427
Amy makes me happy.

251
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,713
<i>You're swelling.</i>

252
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,582
It's sort
of hot in here.

253
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:56,968
Not that hot.

254
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:00,087
Bleeding plus
two more symptoms:

255
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,773
Fever and neurological.

256
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:03,357
I'm not sure about
that last one.

257
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:05,643
I think he's just...weird.

258
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:06,944
He wasn't hallucinating.

259
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:08,696
He didn't have
a thought disorder.

260
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:10,364
And you don't think
it's "disordered" to talk to--

261
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:11,482
It's not all that different

262
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,951
from talking to your cat
or a Teddy bear.

263
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:16,654
You don't have sex
with your cat or Teddy bear.

264
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:18,289
If you did,

265
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,992
you'd probably talk
to them more.

266
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:23,377
Guy loves an imaginary being

267
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:25,246
who's never going
to respond to him.

268
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:28,382
He's no crazier than
millions of churchgoers.

269
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,836
You think anything off
about any patient is a symptom.

270
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,504
This guy buys flowers.

271
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,457
<i>Real</i> flowers for
a piece of plastic in a dress.

272
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:38,509
You know
what's really crazy?

273
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:41,062
Living with a human being.

274
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,564
Someone with
opinions and feelings.

275
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:45,766
Gets mad just 'cause
you want to take Salsa classes

276
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:47,401
with them one night a week.

277
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:48,469
One night.

278
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,321
He's just running away.

279
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:51,572
He hangs out with a doll,

280
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,608
he never needs
to fear rejection.

281
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:54,775
It's sad.

282
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:56,577
You do understand
the irony here?

283
00:11:56,645 --> 00:11:58,412
Every person in this room
has a sex doll.

284
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,747
<i>At least the patient</i>
<i>has the stones</i>

285
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,815
to be honest about it.

286
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:02,834
Ooh, a metaphor.

287
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,285
What you didn't foresee
is that

288
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:05,670
is that I actually do have
a sex doll.

289
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:06,838
Your doll is your kids.

290
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:08,822
Yours is your parents,

291
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:10,157
<i>yours is your charity.</i>

292
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,109
All excuses for not being
in a relationship.

293
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:13,994
He's not wrong.

294
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:15,213
And you--

295
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:16,681
I have meaningless sex
with random strangers.

296
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:17,849
Thanks for the insight,

297
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,467
but I stopped that
months ago.

298
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:20,334
I actually had
a relationship.

299
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,169
With a patient.

300
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,805
You just date whoever happens
to cross your path.

301
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:27,341
My dating is getting
in the way of my dating?

302
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:28,842
<i>You don't go looking for</i>
<i>the right person.</i>

303
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,478
You just shack up
with whoever's in the room,

304
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,313
and then you get surprised
and/or divorced

305
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:33,681
when it doesn't work out.

306
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:35,783
I'm surprised
you haven't asked Adams out yet.

307
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:41,389
Uh, for your information,

308
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:42,823
I've got a date tonight.

309
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,458
I'll be jamming with
a cute guy and his band.

310
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:45,710
- You'll bail.
<i>-  He's right.</i>

311
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:47,078
<i>The obvious solution</i>
<i>is for me to</i>

312
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:48,362
hand my kids over
to your parents.

313
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,081
Can we stop trying to argue
the premise

314
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:51,549
and move onto figuring out
why it is

315
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:53,251
that you're all social morons?

316
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:55,253
You do understand
the irony here.

317
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:58,005
You mocking us
for avoiding relationships,

318
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:00,174
but you can't handle
losing your "doll."

319
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:01,709
<i>Your spending</i>
<i>all this time and energy</i>

320
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,745
interviewing for a new one.

321
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:09,183
You're right.
That is stupid.

322
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:14,188
What about the patient?

323
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,190
Dude's banging a sex doll.

324
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:19,994
<i>A festering cesspool of bodily</i>
<i>fluids and associated bacteria.</i>

325
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:21,696
Swab her out
and find out which one.

326
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:25,866
I need you.

327
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,752
Please don't quit.

328
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:30,871
You're the only hooker
I know who can tune a piano.

329
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:32,290
If it's about the money,

330
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:35,092
then I can up you
to three nights a week.

331
00:13:35,177 --> 00:13:38,912
I'm getting married, House.

332
00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:40,848
His name's Harris.

333
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:42,600
He's a certified accountant,

334
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:44,418
he's loves
schlocky horror movies,

335
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:45,937
and he just moved in.

336
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:47,805
We're very happy.

337
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:52,109
Well, you're happy?

338
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:53,978
Yeah, you're happy
because he doesn't know

339
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:55,479
about your employment history.

340
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:56,647
He knows.

341
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:58,265
We've talked about it,

342
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,734
and he accepts me
for who I am.

343
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,820
No. He...

344
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:04,205
If he accepted who you were,

345
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:06,324
he would not be making
you give up your career.

346
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:08,576
Women need
their own identities,

347
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,161
their own livelihoods.

348
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:14,832
Otherwise, why was I smoking
all those Virginia Slims?

349
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,501
I know this is weird
for you,

350
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:21,722
but you need to figure out
a way to be okay with it.

351
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,008
I'll miss you, too.

352
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,985
I feel like the stirrups
are overkill.

353
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:53,954
I've never done a pelvic
on a doll before.

354
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:58,175
I'm unfamiliar
with the protocol.

355
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,993
I'm pretty skeeved out
right now.

356
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:01,379
I'm not gonna lie.

357
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:02,430
What House
said back there--

358
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:03,997
House says
a lot of things.

359
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:05,566
I don't just date
whoever shows up.

360
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:08,636
I mean, I did meet women
in the hospital,

361
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:10,471
but they weren't
just flings.

362
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:11,939
Basically, you're explaining

363
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:13,190
why you're not going
to ask me out.

364
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:14,508
That's not what I was--

365
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:18,279
did you want me
to ask you out?

366
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:20,364
Yeah.

367
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:22,483
I told Park to tell Taub

368
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,168
to tell House
to pass you that note.

369
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:28,155
It's completely clean
in there.

370
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:31,692
He said
he just bathed her.

371
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:34,245
Adams...

372
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,331
there's a swelling
beneath the skin...

373
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:41,034
3-inch mass.

374
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:43,036
Is it...

375
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,222
Part of the doll's skeleton?

376
00:15:45,307 --> 00:15:47,207
It feels like a tumor.

377
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,492
CT showed an air-filled mass
in the doll's abdomen.

378
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:02,450
It's probably just
a chemical reaction.

379
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:05,203
Henry left her too close
to a heating pipe or something.

380
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,988
This guy brushes her hair
every morning,

381
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,040
brings home movies for them
to watch together.

382
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,625
You think he tosses her
in a broom closet

383
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:11,993
at the end of each day?

384
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:15,063
More likely than
<i>it</i> getting stomach cancer.

385
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,931
How about clostridium?

386
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,967
Bacteria got trapped in
the airtight cavity,

387
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,501
produced gas...

388
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:22,354
It doesn't explain
the neurological issue.

389
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:23,838
We can explain that
the same way

390
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,974
we explain
the tooth fairy.

391
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:30,845
Oh, I get
to play Solomon.

392
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,731
Cut the doll open.

393
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:34,515
We can't just destroy
the patient's property.

394
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,117
That thing cost 7 grand.

395
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:38,186
Exactly.
Ask him for consent.

396
00:16:38,237 --> 00:16:39,520
<i>If he says yes,</i>

397
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,122
then we get to
go hunting bacteria.

398
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,824
<i>If he says no, there's no need</i>
<i>because he's crazy,</i>

399
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,709
and we need a different theory.

400
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:45,744
See ya.

401
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:47,829
Gotta go build a temple.

402
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:53,601
Okay.

403
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:55,053
You sure?

404
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:57,055
It won't be able to heal
when we're done.

405
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,175
But you think she could tell you
what's wrong with me.

406
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:02,710
<i>Yes.</i>

407
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,481
Okay.

408
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,110
Should we take her
to the procedure room?

409
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:21,496
It's not a her, which means
we can do this anywhere.

410
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,371
<i>Adams...</i>

411
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:31,739
You can know
something's not real

412
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,625
and still love it.

413
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:46,521
I think the procedure room
might be better for this.

414
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:56,297
You are a horrible person.

415
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,702
All I need is to break up
one marriage.

416
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,203
You've broken up
three of your own.

417
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:05,740
You're like the Stephen Hawking
of killing relationships.

418
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,075
Actually, no,
Stephen Hawking

419
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:08,143
<i>is the Stephen Hawking of--</i>

420
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,162
Okay.
I have work to do.

421
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:12,664
<i>Your computer is off.</i>

422
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:15,216
Sorry, I can't hear you
over my "stereo."

423
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:16,284
<i>Why do you assume</i>
<i>that marriage</i>

424
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:18,887
is better than hooking?

425
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:19,888
We don't know anything
about the guy.

426
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:20,889
He could be
a serial killer.

427
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:22,474
Even if that were true,

428
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:24,342
it would still be a toss-up.

429
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:26,627
What kind of guy
marries a hooker?

430
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,896
Somebody who hires hookers.

431
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:30,064
And someone who hires hookers

432
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:32,433
is not exactly
the monogamous type.

433
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:34,402
If we expose him
as a cheater...

434
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:35,487
You're a coward.

435
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:36,905
Would a coward
fight to the end

436
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:40,358
to save a damsel in
soon-to-be-proved distress?

437
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:42,577
Absolutely, if what
he's afraid of is other damsels.

438
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:45,313
Your last relationship
failed so miserably,

439
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:46,498
you ended up in jail.

440
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,449
Now you're clinging
to this hooker

441
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,785
when there are about
3 billion other women out there

442
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:52,486
who aren't call girls,

443
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:54,322
some of whom are attractive
and intelligent,

444
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,824
one of whom is living
in your apartment

445
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:59,594
and is married to you!

446
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:05,333
You're right.

447
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,135
Why am I asking you
for help?

448
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:15,810
You shouldn't sleep
with Chase.

449
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,813
Thank, God.
You got here just in time.

450
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:20,798
What do you have
against him?

451
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:22,984
Nothing,
but House has a way

452
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:24,202
<i>of getting</i>
<i>into people's heads.</i>

453
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:25,653
Just like last week

454
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:28,022
when he was prying into
your relationship with Chase?

455
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:31,292
It was silly then,
and it's silly now.

456
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,194
Why was it silly then?

457
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:36,080
I'm not 5'9" with curves
and flowing hair,

458
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:38,032
so it's impossible for me
to get it on

459
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,667
with a good-looking guy?

460
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:41,836
Wow.
Do you resent me?

461
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:44,672
<i>You're the quirky,</i>
<i>hardworking sophomore</i>

462
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:48,059
and I'm the evil cheerleader

463
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:51,212
If you're not getting any,
it's not my fault.

464
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:59,404
Should we get the one with
the panda on it or the bird?

465
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:01,105
Good choice.

466
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,575
Pandas eat only bamboo,

467
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:06,494
<i>they know nothing about cereal.</i>

468
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:12,083
Your little girl

469
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,401
Thanks.

470
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:14,786
She keeps me very busy.

471
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,171
You and her mom

00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:59,130
- Great.
<i>-  Does she look like she's lying?</i>

533
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:00,181
Kind of.

534
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:03,300
Popo needed a ride
to the doctor,

535
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:04,602
<i>and my mom couldn't,</i>
<i>so--</i>

536
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:08,922
You're terrified of dating
because...

537
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:12,259
<i>a previous relationship ended</i>
<i>because your latent rage</i>

538
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,228
made you vicious in arguments.

539
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,463
Or--

540
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,697
<i>Or reincarnation.</i>

541
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:18,265
In a past life,
she was Anne Boleyn.

542
00:23:18,316 --> 00:23:19,133
<i>Interesting.</i>

543
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,934
Taub feels confident enough

544
00:23:20,986 --> 00:23:23,204
to turn the spotlight
on himself.

545
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:25,706
<i>It's almost as</i>
<i>if he wants me to ask...</i>

546
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:26,907
What's her name?

547
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,275
<i>Wendy Jacobson.</i>

548
00:23:28,326 --> 00:23:30,461
33, Brown grad,
family therapist.

549
00:23:30,545 --> 00:23:31,962
<i>Nice choice.</i>

550
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:33,381
Since you got two families
to "therapize."

551
00:23:33,448 --> 00:23:34,632
<i>First date,</i>

552
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:35,800
we didn't discuss everything
important--

553
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:38,502
So it was just
a one-night stand.

554
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:41,338
You're wrong.
I actually like her.

555
00:23:41,423 --> 00:23:42,556
I'm going to see her again.

556
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:44,558
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

557
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:47,294
Great relationships often start
with snap decisions

558
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:48,962
<i>aimed at proving me wrong.</i>

559
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:51,832
Air bubble in the doll could
mean the silicone is degrading.

560
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,267
<i>If he hailed some particles...</i>

561
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:55,069
Silicone deposition.

562
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,904
That could work.

563
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:59,240
Start him on plasmapheresis.

564
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,275
Now, turning to Adams,

565
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:03,277
my theory is tripartite--

566
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:07,314
Want to hear my thesis?

567
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:08,999
It's kind of interesting.

568
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:11,985
No man comes out.

569
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:17,458
But old naked lady in 3-C
is eating whole block of cheese.

570
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:19,293
Will this hurt?

571
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:21,796
No, you might feel
a little cold, though.

572
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:23,631
Crap.

573
00:24:23,682 --> 00:24:24,465
<i>Hey.</i>

574
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:26,183
I only have a second,

575
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:27,835
but I went to
the time travel lecture.

576
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:30,271
Ah.

577
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:33,140
Whoa.

578
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:37,845
That is...awesome.

579
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:41,449
What is it?

580
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:44,151
It's so...

581
00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:47,988
Oh, realistic.

582
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,874
Oh, and it's all bandaged up.

583
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:54,595
It is one of those
CPR things?

584
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:57,030
No.

585
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:58,031
We're starting a procedure.

586
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,550
A little privacy--

587
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,720
No, no, it's--
it's good that she's here.

588
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:04,722
<i>Molly,</i>

589
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:07,975
I'd like you
to meet Amy.

590
00:25:09,544 --> 00:25:10,895
What?

591
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:14,548
I'm serious.

592
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:17,218
I know it seems
a little strange,

593
00:25:17,285 --> 00:25:21,272
<i>but she means a lot to me.</i>

594
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:27,695
I, um, got
to get back to work.

595
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:29,730
But you just got here.
Sit down.

596
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:31,081
<i>Yeah, but I--</i>

597
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:34,084
I said that I only had a second.

598
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,174
Enjoy the handouts.

599
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,791
<i>Whoa.</i>

600
00:26:06,284 --> 00:26:09,770
Listen, um,
I have to admit something.

601
00:26:09,821 --> 00:26:11,739
Okay.

602
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:18,946
Her mom isn't dead.

603
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:21,048
We're separated.

604
00:26:21,116 --> 00:26:23,334
Uh-huh.

605
00:26:23,418 --> 00:26:26,921
You're the first person
I've asked out since then.

606
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:31,124
I'm not used to explaining...
I panicked.

607
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:34,061
Which I regret, because now
that I've gotten to know you,

608
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:37,815
I like you.

609
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:40,851
It was a really stupid lie.

610
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:43,136
I'm sorry.

611
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:46,306
Was that a different baby?

612
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,278
No...

613
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:54,014
That was a different baby.

614
00:27:15,637 --> 00:27:18,355
It's nice having you here.

615
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,575
I wish you could come over
and get in bed with me.

616
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:29,116
Like this?

617
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:31,351
You're talking?

618
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:32,736
It's not all I can do.

619
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:51,555
Amy, there are doctors...

620
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,424
Shh...

621
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:55,275
I don't know.

622
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:58,929
Just put your hands on me.

623
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:16,229
It hurts.

624
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:17,448
It hurts...

625
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:32,012
Pushing Lorazepam.

626
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,349
If it wasn't neurological
before, it sure is now.

627
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,518
Right upper quadrant's
distended.

628
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:40,270
He's hallucinating because
his liver's failing.

629
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:46,065
Elevated transaminases
confirm liver failure.

630
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:47,035
We'll have to put him
on the transplant list

631
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:48,537
in a couple days.

632
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:50,672
It's clearly not the silicone.
Could be vasculitis.

633
00:28:50,723 --> 00:28:52,090
Serologies were negative.

634
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:56,378
Yeah,
if you want Adams to hear,

635
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:59,547
you might want to not stand
so conspicuously far away.

636
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,816
<i>I'm making coffee.</i>

637
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:03,435
And sometimes,
I date co-workers.

638
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,886
Like everyone else
on the planet.

639
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:05,988
Hepatic fibrosis.

640
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:07,239
If it damaged his platelets,

641
00:29:07,323 --> 00:29:08,240
it'd explain the bleeding.

642
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:09,608
<i>Unexpected.</i>

643
00:29:09,692 --> 00:29:10,909
I actually thought
you might agree with my theory.

644
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:13,061
Because that would mean
nothing's your fault.

645
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:15,530
You fell into relationships
based on proximity.

646
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:16,748
Of course they failed.

647
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,333
<i>But I guess I was wrong.</i>

648
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:21,903
You picked perfect women.
You just screwed it up.

649
00:29:21,955 --> 00:29:24,456
How about all five of us
live together

650
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,291
and the $7,000 sex doll?

651
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:27,442
<i>It'll solve all our hang-ups.</i>

652
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,744
$7,000?

653
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:31,179
Adams suggests
that we all sleep together,

654
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,415
and your issue is high prices?

655
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:34,800
Pretty sure she was joking.

656
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:36,602
Yes, I'm 99% sure
that you're right,

657
00:29:36,686 --> 00:29:38,053
but I would never
forgive myself--

658
00:29:38,104 --> 00:29:39,304
<i>Those dolls are only $5,000.</i>

659
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:42,057
He must have had it customized
somehow.

660
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:47,929
Oh, like, you didn't check
the website?

661
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:50,432
I guess we don't need to ask
how your dating life is going.

662
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:51,850
I was curious.

663
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:53,952
Hepatic fibrosis wouldn't cause
difficulty breathing.

664
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:57,105
It would if liver failure
opened pulmonary av shunts.

665
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:58,206
Fibrosis fits.

666
00:29:58,274 --> 00:29:59,774
Start the patient on steroids

667
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:02,411
and find out how
he pimped his ride.

668
00:30:02,462 --> 00:30:04,162
Why?

669
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:06,548
Because
I don't know the answer.

670
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:19,478
Hey.

671
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:20,628
Foosball?

672
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,764
Can't.
Marriage to destroy.

673
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:25,633
Okay...

674
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:29,637
"Okay" as in passive-aggressive
reverse psychology?

675
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:32,240
Or as in depressed resignation

676
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:36,011
"okay" as in
I changed my mind.

677
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,746
Expand.

678
00:30:37,813 --> 00:30:41,333
Oh, it's morally reprehensible
and bound to fail,

679
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:42,918
but in a weird way,
it's a step forward.

680
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:44,086
This thing with Emily.

681
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:45,120
Contract.

682
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:46,821
It's real without being real.

683
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:49,291
It's a long-term relationship
that can't actually hurt you.

684
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:51,710
It's, um...a stepping stone.

685
00:30:51,794 --> 00:30:52,761
It means you want more.

686
00:30:55,431 --> 00:30:58,050
So, passive-aggressive
reverse psychology.

687
00:30:58,134 --> 00:30:59,651
Got it.

688
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,393
<i>Try not to come on</i>
<i>too strong, okay?</i>

689
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:10,479
Just get to know him a little.
Ease into it.

690
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,347
Why would I ease?

691
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:13,848
True.

692
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,234
You could just walk up and
stick your hand down his pants,

693
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,819
but I heard
there's a middle step.

694
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,021
Men want to have sex.

695
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:22,074
Not with crazy people.

696
00:31:22,158 --> 00:31:24,126
Well, yes,
a lot with crazy people,

697
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:25,860
but not that kind of crazy.

698
00:31:25,912 --> 00:31:27,579
Well, yeah,
that kind of crazy--

699
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:30,082
They don't care how crazy
if she look like me.

700
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:33,385
Okay.
Easing.

701
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:41,309
Hi.
Hey.

702
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:44,262
I'm Jennifer,
new to marketing department.

703
00:31:44,347 --> 00:31:46,264
Harris.
Accounts receivable.

704
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:47,766
Oh, interesting.

705
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,268
Do you want to get
out of here and have sex?

706
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:52,320
Uh, sure.

707
00:31:54,557 --> 00:31:57,242
You know, I got 45 minutes
left on my lunch break.

708
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:59,561
Mm-hmm.
Where you wanna go?

709
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:04,750
Off to a place where men don't
cheat on the women they love.

710
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:06,401
You're not invited,
obviously.

711
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:09,171
Cheating?
What are you talking about?

712
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:11,522
Why, I hope you're speaking

713
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:14,376
out of some deep kind
of moral relativism because--

714
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:16,511
Who are you people?

715
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,381
You're not Emily's fiance.

716
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:24,219
Emily's my sister.

717
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:31,777
We called the company
that made Amy.

718
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:36,431
They said they modeled her after
some photos you sent them.

719
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:43,121
Who is she?

720
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:47,292
We met last Christmas.

721
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:50,945
She's a yoga instructor.

722
00:32:50,997 --> 00:32:52,447
Totally different from me.

723
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:56,485
She--she loved Chopin,
hated Indian food.

724
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:04,259
She changed entire my life
for 17 weeks.

725
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:13,869
My husband cheated on me...

726
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:21,843
With a girl he met on the plane
coming back from our honeymoon.

727
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,449
It's not easy to get past things
like that.

728
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:35,023
She wasn't unfaithful.
She didn't betray me.

729
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:40,195
She just...she just wasn't
in love with me.

730
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:50,305
I know Amy's not going
to break your heart.

731
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:53,108
But she's also not going
to change your life.

732
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:02,951
The lights are bright.

733
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:08,156
Sorry.
What's happening to me?

734
00:34:08,207 --> 00:34:09,824
Is your neck stiff?

735
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,493
Yeah.

736
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:15,213
I think you have meningitis.

737
00:34:15,298 --> 00:34:17,031
<i>I'm not leaving</i>
<i>the business.</i>

738
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:22,270
I'm just leaving you.

739
00:34:22,338 --> 00:34:23,371
I didn't want you
to feel bad.

740
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:24,506
So let me get this straight.

741
00:34:24,557 --> 00:34:27,742
I'm being dumped
by a hooker...

742
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,177
Who's worried about
my feelings?

743
00:34:29,245 --> 00:34:30,245
You're married.

744
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:32,063
Half your clients
are married.

745
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:33,565
And you're a hooker.

746
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:36,384
My other guys sneak around,

747
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:38,019
but you'll take me
into the bedroom

748
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,321
while your wife's
in the next room.

749
00:34:39,388 --> 00:34:41,306
That's just...mean.

750
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:43,057
Oh, my God.

751
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:45,794
The marriage, it's a sham.

752
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:48,997
The only really thing
about it is the green card

753
00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:51,449
she's going to get
at the end of it.

754
00:34:51,534 --> 00:34:53,735
So, if you want
to get the meter running...

755
00:34:53,786 --> 00:34:55,754
It's still mean.

756
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,674
It's not a marriage.
It's a felony.

757
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:03,645
I've seen how she looks at you
when you're together.

758
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:05,146
<i>Trust me.</i>

759
00:35:05,214 --> 00:35:06,514
She likes you.

760
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:10,769
And I've seen
how you look at her.

761
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:19,442
Fever's up 105.
He's not responding to meds.

762
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,444
At this rate,
he'll be dead

763
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,829
by the time we get
the cultures back.

764
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,747
Spinal fluid was full
of white cells.

765
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:26,332
Meningitis could be
carcinomatous.

766
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,917
Cytology showed nothing.

767
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:31,004
An amoebic infection would cause
fever and meningitis.

768
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,005
But not liver failure.

769
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,957
It could if he had a clot.

770
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:36,609
<i>How could amoebas get past</i>
<i>his cribriform plate?</i>

771
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:40,213
He went swimming in
a frozen lake in New Jersey?

772
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:45,134
Adams said his ex-girlfriend
was a yoga instructor.

773
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,553
Maybe he sprained his chakras.

774
00:35:46,637 --> 00:35:47,887
Yoga nuts are
way more likely

775
00:35:47,972 --> 00:35:49,338
to be into
alternative medicine.

776
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,192
He has this little weird teapot
in his house.

777
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,011
What was it like?

778
00:35:55,062 --> 00:36:00,116
Um, little.
Weird. Teapot-ish.

779
00:36:07,074 --> 00:36:08,358
Like that?

780
00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:09,993
Yeah.

781
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,161
You think he drinks some
sort of toxic herbal tea?

782
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:13,263
<i>Yes...</i>

783
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,532
If by "tea,"
you mean salted tap water.

784
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:19,201
And by "drink,"
you mean poured up his nose.

785
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:21,804
His girlfriend didn't just leave
him with a broken heart.

786
00:36:21,872 --> 00:36:23,840
She left him with a neti pot.

787
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:25,058
It's an Indian method of.

788
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:28,711
Of clearing the sinuses
during allergy season.

789
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:30,346
Also known as now.

790
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:34,317
The distilled water can act
as a snot flushing system.

791
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:38,037
With tap water, it can act
as an amoeba delivery system

792
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:39,722
to the fluids around the brain.

793
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,524
<i>Start him on metronidazole.</i>

794
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,626
If he's lucky,
he'll get to see

795
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:46,663
his plastic children
walk down the aisle.

796
00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:53,670
My neck
feels much better.

797
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:55,004
Your fever's gone,

798
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,290
and your liver function's
almost back to normal.

799
00:36:57,374 --> 00:36:59,008
You should be able
to go home soon.

800
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:01,711
I'm going to have some hospital
bills to pay.

801
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:06,248
I don't suppose used sex dolls
go for anything online.

802
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:11,137
Dr. Adams?

803
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:14,090
Can I get your email?

804
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:16,025
What for?

805
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:20,980
I just thought maybe
we could see each other again.

806
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:24,984
I-I can't.

807
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:26,336
<i>No, I know.</i>

808
00:37:26,403 --> 00:37:27,787
It's a professionalism thing,

809
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,073
but you won't be my doctor
when I get out of here.

810
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,108
It's not that.
It's--

811
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,242
<i>what is it?</i>

812
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,444
You said I should
change my life.

813
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:37,163
You were talking
about yourself, too.

814
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:39,215
I know you were.
Henry, I--

815
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:41,751
I think you should
ask Molly out.

816
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,808
I should have known
this would happen.

817
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,561
You're a good guy, Henry.

818
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:56,632
You deserve more than a doll.

819
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:02,638
Promise me
you'll keep trying.

820
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,158
Okay.

821
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,585
Date tonight?

822
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,823
So she can't deal.

823
00:38:20,874 --> 00:38:22,625
There's someone
out there who can.

824
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,377
You just got to find her.

825
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:26,179
I'd love to prove
House wrong,

826
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:29,799
but...I ruined my marriage,

827
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,267
broke two people's hearts,

828
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:32,852
had two kids who are always

829
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,521
going to wonder why I didn't
love their mommy enough.

830
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:40,893
It's better if I just...
focus on what I do have.

831
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:46,532
Give that band guy a call.

832
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:49,118
I'm not that good at guitar.

833
00:38:49,186 --> 00:38:53,156
Or flirting or small talk.

834
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:56,292
I'm not as pretty as Adams,

835
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:59,695
I have stuffy clothes,
and I hate my hair.

836
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:02,915
Adams works 80 hours a week
fixing bunions on hobos

837
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,302
because she can't face getting
to know someone new.

838
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:07,570
Trust me.

839
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:13,042
You find a boyfriend,
she'll be the jealous one.

840
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,098
See you tomorrow.

841
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:23,986
Do you...

842
00:39:25,555 --> 00:39:27,890
want to get a drink?

843
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:30,660
To annoy Park
or to prove House wrong?

844
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:34,730
Oh, I...
It's just, um...

845
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:37,366
I think it's time
for a change.

846
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:44,974
I don't really think that's
a good idea for me right now.

847
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:51,714
House has a way
of getting in people's heads.

848
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:54,884
Yeah.
Yeah.

849
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:07,947
No, mom.
I'm still at work.

850
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,433
I'll be home in a couple hours.

851
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:13,369
Love you too.

852
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,446
Ready?

853
00:40:24,498 --> 00:40:27,917
One, two, three, four.
