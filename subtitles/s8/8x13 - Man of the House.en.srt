1
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:08,619
Let's get back
to Phil and Diane.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,838
<i>Phil's been having</i>
<i>a hard time finding work,</i>

3
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,339
and Diane wants him
to talk to her

4
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,275
about his fear,
his disappointment.

5
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:17,127
And Phil wants Diane
to trust him

6
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,346
that they'll
get through this,

7
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:22,633
ideally, without having to keep
discussing feelings.

8
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:25,186
Not your exact words,
but am I wrong?

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,857
And most guys out there
are the same way,

10
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,643
but ladies, if you're
feeling frustrated,

11
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:35,579
remember,
it's not our fault.

12
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:39,750
We were raised to be strong,
not emotional,

13
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:43,921
to deny vulnerability,
not embrace it.

14
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:45,539
And do you know
what that makes us?

15
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:46,540
Dinosaurs.

16
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:49,710
<i>Nobody needs us</i>

17
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:51,128
to hunt
wild animals for food.

18
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,431
Nobody needs us to cut down
trees to build shelter.

19
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:58,469
They need us to evolve,
to catch up.

20
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:05,509
Since the 1960s, women's roles
have shifted radically.

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,782
And as--uh, as their--
in--as their roles have changed,

22
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,535
so have women, they've--
they've, uh--

23
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,387
<i>well, they've</i>
<i>become tougher,</i>

24
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:17,571
and more demanding of us.

25
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:19,156
They're partners.

26
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,659
And--and--who can blame them?
Who--who can--

27
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,961
who can, uh...

28
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:28,215
expecting us to...

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,551
to do this...

30
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:34,371
Joe! Joe!

31
00:01:34,422 --> 00:01:35,556
Joe!

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,309
Joe.

33
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:40,544

[Massive Attack's <i>Teardrop]</i>

36
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:15,032
You want?

37
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,736
I'm good.

38
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:20,437
Your limp's almost gone.

39
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,908
It pains me to interrupt
the collegial banter,

40
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,787
<i>it pains me even more</i>
<i>to listen to it continue.</i>

41
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:27,322
<i>38-year-old man.</i>

42
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:30,592
Spikes a fever and collapses
during a speaking engagement.

43
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,210
E.R. checks out
blood volume,

44
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:35,213
cardiac function, and autonomic
reflexes, all normal.

45
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:38,684
Patient makes a living telling
men to behave more like women.

46
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:39,551
I'm surprised you didn't
throw psych symptoms

47
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,436
into the differential.

48
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:43,071
Either way,
could be a cerebral AVM.

49
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,107
E.R. did a head CT.
No sign of AVM.

50
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:46,441
Decent thought, though.

51
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:50,612
The patient's philosophy
makes perfect sense.

52
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,314
Its only flaw is that
it's impossible.

53
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:54,182
Evolution does not
work that way.

54
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,734
You can't talk legs
onto a fish.

55
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:57,452
We're gonna go extinct,

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,372
and we're gonna do it drinking
scotch and driving muscle cars.

57
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:03,542
Am I right?

58
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:07,129
Am I--thank you.

59
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:08,196
Cephalic fibromuscular
dysplasia?

60
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:09,881
It doesn't explain
the fever.

61
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:11,583
The patient's talking
about compromise.

62
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,135
If you don't think
that's possible,

63
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:15,337
you don't think
relationships are possible.

64
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:17,089
Anyone in this room
in a position to disprove that?

65
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:19,424
This guy's just
playing to his audience.

66
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:21,343
Women are, by far,
the biggest consumers

67
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:22,978
<i>of the self-help</i>
<i>industry.</i>

68
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:24,479
He could have
a pulmonary embolism.

69
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:26,314
Clot in his lung increases
right ventricular afterload,

70
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:28,116
<i>drops the blood flow</i>
<i>to his brain.</i>

71
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:29,818
We should do
a pulmonary angiogram.

72
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:31,653
Patient lacks major
risk factors for a P.E.

73
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,955
Doesn't rule it out,
just makes it unlikely.

74
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:35,107
Maybe we start
with a D-dimer?

75
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:36,942
Less invasive
than the angiogram.

76
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:40,328
<i>Good idea.</i>

77
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,832
Fine.

78
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:47,686
Now, I am hereby
searching for a number two.

79
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:49,704
So I'm eating a lot of Bran.

80
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,457
Also, I want a team leader.

81
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,910
Someone to fill
Foreman's old job.

82
00:03:54,977 --> 00:03:56,711
Why?

83
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,430
You're right. We don't need
any more structure.

84
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:01,550
It's not like we had
a near-fatal stabbing.

85
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:12,727
Well, if it isn't
the old ball and Ukraine.

86
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:13,761
Who's that?

87
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:17,449
His wife.

88
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,317
Dominika.
House.

89
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:21,820
You survived prison.

90
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,573
And you Atlantic City,

91
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:25,991
where they also have
gangs and pruno,

92
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,326
but slightly less
recidivism.

93
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:31,496
I start Ukrainian
food truck business.

94
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:34,800
After gambling--win, lose--
everybody likes a little knish.

95
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:36,802
You're here, and I seem
to remember throwing out

96
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:40,305
a bunch of certified letters
from immigration.

97
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,590
I'm assuming there's
a connection.

98
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:43,508
Our green card interview
is in four days.

99
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:44,843
They come to the apartment,

100
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,179
they ask questions
about marriage,

101
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:49,464
vacations, family history,

102
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:51,433
what side of the bed
each sleep on.

103
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:54,319
We've never taken
a vacation,

104
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:56,255
I don't like your family,
and on top.

105
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:59,423
I hear Kiev is lovely
this time of year.

106
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,992
And your mother,
who may or may not be dead,

107
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:03,495
for all I know,
misses you.

108
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,447
Can it be that genius doctor
is afraid to take on

109
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:08,133
a silly government
apparatchik?

110
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:12,320
Well, I would say more
not interested than afraid,

111
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,288
but why quibble?

112
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:15,707
Then I go to plan "B."

113
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,561
Make you an offer
that cannot be refused.

114
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:23,081
How long you been
doing seminars?

115
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,418
The marriage counseling,
just, uh, the past couple years.

116
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:27,953
<i>Before that,</i>
<i>I did corporate coaching.</i>

117
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,539
Can't imagine the same advice
works for both audiences.

118
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,124
Guess you shifted
with the market?

119
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,910
There's nothing cynical
about my husband. He and I--

120
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,145
No, it's okay.
I get it.

121
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:40,282
What guy thinks men
should be more like women?

122
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,267
A macho jerk who got
a big wake-up call

123
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:45,086
courtesy of three drunks
who beat the crap outta me

124
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:46,555
<i>outside a sports bar</i>
<i>in Milwaukee.</i>

125
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:48,390
I'm guessing that
explains the broken wrist

126
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:50,091
<i>in your medical</i>
<i>history?</i>

127
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,094
Those morons did me
the biggest favor of my life.

128
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,663
I realized I'd sacrificed

129
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,798
my health because
I couldn't back down

130
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:59,434
from an argument
over football.

131
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,954
Meeting Marlene was
the final piece in the puzzle.

132
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,573
She changed
my career, my diet.

133
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:08,210
She gave me a whole new
direction in life.

134
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:11,463
We'll need to know exactly
how you changed your diet,

135
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,715
<i>and when.</i>

136
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:16,885
Need my apartment key back.

137
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:18,620
If you're breaking up
with me,

138
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:19,771
can we at least
talk about it first?

139
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,141
Maybe if you weren't
all nag and no shag.

140
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:26,595
I don't sleep
with married men.

141
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,647
I'll get a copy made.

142
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,148
You're an ex-con.

143
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:33,235
If you get caught perjuring
yourself to Homeland Security,

144
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:34,836
you'll end up
back in jail.

145
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:36,404
And that would be
troubling if there was

146
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:37,639
the slightest chance
that we'd get caught.

147
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,074
You barely know
each other.

148
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:42,077
You've got about five minutes
to remake yourselves

149
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:43,645
into a convincing
married couple.

150
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,080
And why?

151
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:48,116
Dominika gets a green card.
What's in this for you?

152
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:52,187
This is what men do for
the women they pretend to love.

153
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,956
Also, she's paying me
30,000 bucks once we pass.

154
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:57,125
Apparently knishes
sell like hotcakes.

155
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:59,144
Lab results.

156
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,180
Afraid you're gonna
have to finish your nag later.

157
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:03,965
I said I think
it's stupid, right?

158
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:08,520
Then I think I'm done.

159
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:12,840
D-dimer came back normal.
Rules out pulmonary embolism.

160
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,175
And our patient's
a true believer

161
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,644
about the follies
of masculinity.

162
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:18,530
He underwent a spiritual
overhaul three years ago.

163
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:20,315
He also went off
gluten and red meat.

164
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:22,817
Unfortunately, that doesn't
explain any of his symptoms.

165
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:25,053
One of those points
is not absurd.

166
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:26,371
What's absurd about
a change of heart?

167
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:29,541
What this guy believes
is making him a better person.

168
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,959
He's going against
his baser instincts.

169
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,661
"Base" meaning
foundational.

170
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:35,630
Meaning things we are
biologically programmed to do.

171
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:39,834
Yes, perfectly natural that
he stopped doing that stuff.

172
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:41,336
You know,
that's the kind of lapse

173
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:43,871
that could take you out of
the running for team leader.

174
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:48,009
I feel surprisingly
okay with that.

175
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,562
Comes with
a 50-buck-a-week raise.

176
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:52,947
I'm in.

177
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,516
You don't want
to do that.

178
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:55,850
Might need your
dignity later in life.

179
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:58,236
You didn't.

180
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,572
And she could be on her way
to living the dream

181
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:05,527
unless the rest of you
nut up and give her--

182
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:09,447
this spiritual overhaul...

183
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,916
Did it come after
a physical overhaul?

184
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:13,952
A major injury
of some kind?

185
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,286
<i>Bar fight.</i>

186
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,788
But there's no way
a broken wrist explains--

187
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,007
Adams, come with me.

188
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:21,426
You too.

189
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,178
You guys...

190
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:27,382
Get a copy of that made.

191
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:33,471
Did those dudes bend your
ball sack like Beckham?

192
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,974
Three years ago.
The bar fight.

193
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,276
This is Dr. House.
He has a theory.

194
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,363
Oh, Dr. Adams,
would you mind?

195
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:50,905
I asked you a question.
I assume you know the answer.

196
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:53,625
Yeah, I took a couple
serious knees to the groin.

197
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,777
Wha--

198
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:57,445
<i>what has gotten into me?</i>

199
00:08:57,513 --> 00:09:00,148
Dr. Chase.

200
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:04,252
Just pick it up.

201
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:07,255
<i>Do you know what's</i>
<i>wrong with me?</i>

202
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:08,556
<i>Nothing that</i>
<i>The Golden Girls</i>

203
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:12,627
couldn't have handled
in 23 hilarious minutes.

204
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:13,728
You had a hot flash.

205
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:16,347
Those guys
kicked your guys

206
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,866
hard enough to do
lasting damage.

207
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,951
You didn't even look
when presented

208
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,604
with two reasonably
attractive tuchi.

209
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:24,823
Yeah, I said it!

210
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:27,108
I was listening
to my doctor.

211
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,193
People generally
listen with their ears,

212
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,494
leaving their eyes
free to wander.

213
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:31,112
I'm guessing that
your testosterone level

214
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,181
is just below "Bieber."

215
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:36,284
Do a blood test to confirm,
and STT hormone replacement.

216
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:39,053
It's no wonder that you
think women are so great.

217
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:43,658
You've basically been one
for the last three years.

218
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,511
Tests confirm
House is right.

219
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:48,379
Low testosterone
explains all your symptoms.

220
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:50,632
They should go away
with replacement therapy.

221
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:52,517
Uh, we're gonna give you
a fairly high dose.

222
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:53,518
Over time,
your personal physician

223
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:54,636
may reduce it a little.

224
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,472
Just need you
to turn around.

225
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:59,858
Will the shots
increase his libido?

226
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:01,109
Are you worried
about that?

227
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:04,446
No.

228
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:06,281
Have you been
unsatisfied?

229
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:09,284
No. No, it's just...

230
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:11,853
Well, it's usually me
that initiates things.

231
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,187
Sometimes I--

232
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:17,191
I think maybe you aren't
that attracted to me.

233
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,760
Are you crazy?

234
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:21,963
With these injections, you will
see an increase in sex drive.

235
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,667
Okay, great.
Yeah.

236
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:27,552
Okay.

237
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:37,545
All done.
Okay.

238
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,481
<i>Oh, something's wrong.</i>

239
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,232
I think I peed myself.

240
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:44,068
<i>Is that from</i>
<i>the testosterone?</i>

241
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:46,070
It couldn't be.

242
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:49,023
I don't think you're
going home just yet.

243
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:51,228
<i>It's not</i>
<i>a plumbing problem.</i>

244
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:52,888
<i>Means it's probably</i>
<i>neurological.</i>

245
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,743
And?

246
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,462
<i>And name Dominika's</i>
<i>three brothers.</i>

247
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:02,565
Uh...

248
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:07,470
Volodymyr, Oleksiy, and...

249
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,025
Low testosterone is off
the table as a symptom.

250
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,160
Guy got his nuts cracked
three years ago.

251
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:16,362
<i>Don't need to look</i>
<i>much further than that.</i>

252
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:17,997
So his hose just happens
to spring a leak

253
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:19,615
at the same time
he's in a hospital

254
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,618
for a totally
unrelated problem.

255
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,420
Fjodor.

256
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:25,455
It's Fedir.

257
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:26,873
If low testosterone means

258
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:28,508
I can't get sick
with something else,

259
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,343
then punch me
in the junk right now.

260
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:32,795
I would,
if it weren't redundant.

261
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:35,014
Is Fedir the one
who married Mykola?

262
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:38,935
Mykola is Dominika's uncle.

263
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:40,937
How is it you can
retain every detail

264
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:42,638
of our habits
and personal lives,

265
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,140
and none of this?

266
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:45,024
'Cause I find it hard
to remember things

267
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:47,276
I don't give a crap about.

268
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:51,013
Ergo, Dominika has one brother,
and his name is Al.

269
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,649
Maybe the testicular damage set
the stage for something worse.

270
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:55,651
Multiple Sclerosis
causes incontinence,

271
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,737
and progresses faster
in men with low T.

272
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,805
<i>Way to stay on point.</i>

273
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:00,623
It's that kind
of leadership

274
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,625
that's putting you
at the head of the pack.

275
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,661
There is no pack.
She's the only applicant.

276
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:08,131
Well, that's settled, then.

277
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,476
Have your underlings
do an LP

278
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:12,088
and get a cranio-spinal MRI

279
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,257
to check for plaques
associated with M.S.

280
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:17,945
I will go tell Foreman
about your promotion.

281
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,780
Wait.

282
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,452
<i>So nobody cares about the job</i>
<i>till I apply, and suddenly</i>

283
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,238
it's the last limited-edition
lightsaber at Comic-Con.

284
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,240
Just seems like it should
go to someone with more...

285
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,458
Seniority.

286
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,626
Meaning you.

287
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,961
I said "more,"
not "most."

288
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,879
Meaning you or Taub.

289
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:37,131
House is a dictator.

290
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,466
Second in command
is a meaningless position.

291
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,117
Doesn't look meaningless
on my resume.

292
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:43,420
Doesn't have to be
meaningless at all.

293
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,140
The right person could
turn it into something.

294
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,791
Get the department
running smoothly.

295
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:49,977
I wonder who
that "right person" could be.

296
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,962
House is the head
of the department.

297
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:53,463
It's only fair
that a woman

298
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:54,965
should hold the other
position of authority.

299
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:56,767
Yeah, let's go
affirmative action on this,

300
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,352
because then I'll
definitely win.

301
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:00,303
This is what House wants.

302
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,806
Wind us up and watch us
fight over an empty title,

303
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:04,825
which would make us
extra stupid

304
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,977
because of what
we've just been through.

305
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:11,815
We should let him choose
whoever he wants and move on.

306
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:16,553
So if these proteins
are in my spinal fluid,

307
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,155
that means I have M.S.?

308
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:19,339
Proteins may indicate M.S.

309
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,924
There's no one
definitive test.

310
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:23,177
That's why Dr. House
ordered an MRI as well.

311
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:26,113
<i>This is anesthetic.</i>

312
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,382
<i>It's a scary diagnosis.</i>

313
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:30,901
But advances
are being made.

314
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:33,971
Several drugs approved
just this year.

315
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:35,239
To be honest,
at the moment,

316
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:36,890
I'm feeling
a little more worried

317
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,058
<i>about the testosterone</i>
<i>injections.</i>

318
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,109
<i>It's making me feel,</i>
<i>uh, different.</i>

319
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:43,313
Just kind of amped.

320
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,915
I went through
this big life change,

321
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:46,683
and it felt really...

322
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:49,469
Meaningful.

323
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,457
But what if it was
all just chemistry?

324
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:55,909
Loss of testosterone
could have been a factor,

325
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:58,979
but think of it
as a catalyst.

326
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,648
<i>It got you to reevaluate.</i>
<i>Now you know what's important.</i>

327
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,867
You can choose
to hold onto that.

328
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:06,336
Right?

329
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,673
It's certainly
worth trying.

330
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,207
Deep breath,
stay very still.

331
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,013
Just tell House to drop
the whole team leader thing.

332
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,714
That's the only way
it'll go away.

333
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:19,716
I don't think it's
such a bad idea.

334
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:23,153
A little more structure in your
department couldn't hurt.

335
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:24,821
Yeah.

336
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,907
House is doing this because
of his great love of structure,

337
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,326
not because he wants us
to turn on each other.

338
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:32,529
So don't do that.

339
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,064
It makes sense to have
someone in there

340
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:36,700
with a little more
accountability.

341
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,902
As long as
it's not Adams.

342
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:40,737
She sees the whole thing
as an opportunity

343
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:43,423
to remake the department
in her image.

344
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,543
Or Park,
for obvious reasons.

345
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,012
And Taub's got the kids.
He's pretty busy.

346
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,248
Are you seriously angling

347
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,251
for a job that you mocked its
fate the whole time I had it?

348
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:56,753

You're giving up?

524
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:10,785
I wish.

525
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:13,671
I still have a lot
of med school debt,

526
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:16,541
and my parents need help
with their mortgage.

527
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,376
So I could kinda
use the money.

528
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:23,381
As of an hour ago, I'm just
seeing one of everything.

529
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:24,299
Looks like you guys
were right--

530
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,270
We'll be right back.

531
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:31,055
"I could use the money"?

532
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,640
You want to game me,
you gotta do better than that.

533
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:34,025
- Chase--
- You want to be a leader,

534
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:35,443
you have to know
how to manipulate.

535
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:36,611
You can't just spill--

536
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:40,014
I think the whites
of his eyes were yellow.

537
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:48,022
Everything okay?

538
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:50,158
Jaundice.

539
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:53,127
There's something
wrong with your liver.

540
00:23:54,286 --> 00:23:56,626
Liver function tests
confirm his enzymes

541
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:58,163
are totally out of whack.

542
00:23:58,214 --> 00:23:59,715
So much for
myasthenia gravis.

543
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,183
Can we hurry this up?

544
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,185
I have a government
to defraud at noon.

545
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:04,853
If you need to leave,
you should.

546
00:24:04,938 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm fairly confident
our patient's got sarcoidosis.

547
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,358
<i>Wow, you said that</i>
<i>with so much authority.</i>

548
00:24:09,442 --> 00:24:12,110
Did anyone else
get chills?

549
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:13,478
Just until I realized
our patient has

550
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:15,280
no sign of parenchymal
lung abnormalities,

551
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:17,032
<i>which makes sarcoidosis</i>
<i>a long shot.</i>

552
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:19,751
And bookkeeping isn't gonna
get you any farther than boobs.

553
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:23,238
Though in fairness, the boobs
were really, really helping.

554
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:24,873
<i>I still think</i>
<i>it's myasthenia gravis.</i>

555
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:25,991
Did you miss the recap?

556
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:26,908
We treated for that.
The liver tanked.

557
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:29,828
But his vision got better.

558
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:32,564
Liver problems could be
a sign of celiac.

559
00:24:32,632 --> 00:24:34,383
He's been back on gluten
since he's been in the hospital.

560
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:35,700
Yesterday he had a burger.

561
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:37,085
That would've kicked
the celiac into gear,

562
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,420
causing the liver
problems.

563
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:41,556
So your theory is that
he has two unrelated diseases.

564
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:44,926
And he's already got
low testosterone.

565
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:46,678
I seem to remember something
about House hating coincidences.

566
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,597
It's true.

567
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:50,265
<i>I think it's</i>
<i>Lyme Disease.</i>

568
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,234
One single disease
named "Lyme."

569
00:24:52,318 --> 00:24:53,819
Without a rash.

570
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:58,056
10% of cases present
without a rash.

571
00:24:58,107 --> 00:24:59,107
Lyme Disease it is.

572
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:01,360
Start the patient
on antibiotics.

573
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:06,198
Now I have to get home before
my fake wife gets real annoyed.

574
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:12,954
Something bothering you?

575
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,172
I asked the nurse
for an extra pillow.

576
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,573
That was half an hour ago.

577
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,625
Sorry.

578
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:17,759
Things can get
pretty hectic.

579
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:18,877
It was a pillow.

580
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:22,247
I mean, how hard
can a pil--

581
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:26,101
listen to me.
I'm being a jerk.

582
00:25:26,185 --> 00:25:28,220
Testosterone can give you
a shorter temper

583
00:25:28,271 --> 00:25:30,105
even when
you're not sick.

584
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:32,107
You noticed and adjusted.
That's a good thing.

585
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:36,261
Hey.

586
00:25:36,312 --> 00:25:37,612
Just got a call
from our lawyer.

587
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:41,099
You changed our counter
to leading lights?

588
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,200
You deserve proper billing

589
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:43,118
and a salary bump
in the second term.

590
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:44,736
We talked about this.

591
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:46,405
We decided it wasn't worth
potentially blowing the deal.

592
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:51,460
It'll be fine.

593
00:25:51,544 --> 00:25:55,163
I've got to get
some work done.

594
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:03,338
These are such pretty flowers
you buy for me

595
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:05,957
<i>every Friday,</i>
<i>from Japanese florist,</i>

596
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:09,061
on corner of Edison
and Conway.

597
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:12,314
Just one more thing.

598
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:16,468
With this ring,
I thee wedded.

599
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:20,105
You left it here

600
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:21,973
when you skipped town
with your boyfriend.

601
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:24,526
You kept the rings.

602
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,577
Actually, I tried
to trade them to a hooker

603
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:27,145
for unspecified favors,

604
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:28,447
but it turns out
she doesn't accept zinc.

605
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:32,417
Like modern fairytale.

606
00:26:42,462 --> 00:26:44,963
Dr. and Mrs. Gregory House?

607
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:46,164
Yeah.

608
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:49,134
Nate Weinmann.
U.S. Immigration.

609
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:52,020
Welcome to our home.

610
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:09,371
Give him time.

611
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:11,289
When I was 14,

612
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:12,991
there was a girl
I wanted to impress,

613
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,409
so I jumped off
the roof of her house.

614
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:17,662
Broke my ankle.

615
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:20,298
Joe's basically
going through puberty.

616
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:24,669
It'll take him
a while to adjust.

617
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,087
I-I tracked down a video

618
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:27,722
from one of Joe's
business coaching seminars

619
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:31,977
from before I knew him.

620
00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:35,063
<i>I'm hearing a lot</i>
<i>about the value of compromise.</i>

621
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:37,098
We don't live
on <i>Sesame Street.</i>

622
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:41,269
We live in the real world,
the business world.

623
00:27:41,337 --> 00:27:43,822
If you're not a winner,
you're a loser.

624
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:46,057
<i>If you aren't</i>
<i>comfortable with that,</i>

625
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,743
go open a pottery studio.

626
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:56,451
I never would have gone out
with the guy in this video.

627
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:03,175
Uh, do you remember
the last time she visited Vasyl?

628
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:07,412
Uh, let me see,
that would be...

629
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:08,847
August?

630
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:11,383
No. No, July.

631
00:28:11,434 --> 00:28:14,769
'Cause I remember it was right
after our half-anniversary,

632
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:17,105
and I forgot to put
a gift in her suitcase.

633
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,775
And...I've never heard
the end of that one.

634
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,644
House specialty.

635
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:25,597
I made up this pun.

636
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,402
Is it--

637
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:32,770
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

638
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:34,322
Honey, why do you
do this to me?

639
00:28:34,407 --> 00:28:36,374
You know I'm
watching my weight.

640
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:37,626
Then maybe you'll
stop eating cheese

641
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,579
in front of open fridge
in middle of the night.

642
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:43,248
<i>This is delicious.</i>

643
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:44,332
Thank you.

644
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:47,802
So everything
looks good in here.

645
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:51,640
I'm just gonna step out and get
a corroborating interview

646
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:53,391
from one of the neighbors.

647
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:55,627
Neighbors?

648
00:28:55,678 --> 00:28:57,596
It's--it's middle
of the day.

649
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,014
<i>I-I-I think</i>
<i>everybody's at work.</i>

650
00:28:59,098 --> 00:29:00,148
Yeah, then they're at work.

651
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:01,566
I just got a form
to check off,

652
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:05,103
and you will be on your way
to permanent status.

653
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:15,947
<i>'Scuse me, sir.</i>

654
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:18,116
Do you have a minute?

655
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,201
How can I help you?

656
00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:21,953
Do you know
Dr. and Mrs. House?

657
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:23,622
Of course,
they've been my neighbors

658
00:29:23,673 --> 00:29:25,757
<i>about two years, now.</i>

659
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:26,791
<i>Lovely couple.</i>

660
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:29,327
I see them
almost every night.

661
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:30,762
They seem always
to be together.

662
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:31,829
Great, well,
thanks for your help.

663
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:34,966
Cheerio.

664
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:37,702
Hey, what're you doing?
That's my door.

665
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:45,577
Handing out menus
for a new Chinese place.

666
00:29:45,628 --> 00:29:47,495
You're that guy
that plays noisy video games

667
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,384
with House
on Saturday nights.

668
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:04,062
There's a simple
explanation.

669
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:14,172
Be at my office
tomorrow at 10:00.

670
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,627
The patient's shown
zero improvement.

671
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,605
Because he's only been
on the antibiotics overnight.

672
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:27,515
Or because he doesn't
have Lyme Disease.

673
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:28,783
Where are you?

674
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,034
<i>Oh, just chillin'.</i>

675
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,120
<i>U.S. citizenship</i>
<i>at immigration.</i>

676
00:30:32,187 --> 00:30:34,422
<i>Waiting on my fraud interview</i>
<i>with my wife and my attorney.</i>

677
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,241
- No big.
- House.

678
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:39,377
Hang up.

679
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:41,712
<i>I still think it's</i>
<i>myasthenia gravis plus celiac.</i>

680
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:44,067
His change in diet
has to be significant.

681
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:46,453
We just need to do
an intestinal biopsy to confirm.

682
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:48,628
With his low platelet count,
a biopsy puts him at risk

683
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:51,130
for an abdominal bleed,
which puts him at risk of death.

684
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,369
Either you're done,

685
00:30:57,421 --> 00:31:00,539
or you're walking in there
without a lawyer.

686
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:04,560
I know,
it sounds like a phone,

687
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:08,047
but it's a timer to remind me
to pee before our meeting.

688
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:15,905
Hello, old chap.

689
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:17,740
You need to save yourself.

690
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,224
<i>I was up last night</i>

691
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:20,743
<i>trying to find another angle,</i>
<i>but I can't.</i>

692
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:23,496
Tell immigration you were
in love with Dominika,

693
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:24,914
but your marriage
fell apart,

694
00:31:24,998 --> 00:31:28,701
and that's why you haven't
been living together.

695
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,586
She'll be deported
permanently.

696
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:31,871
<i>House, I know</i>
<i>you like Dominika,</i>

697
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:35,041
you have fun with her,
but you got caught.

698
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:36,742
There's no
getting out of this.

699
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:41,547
<i>The best you could hope for is</i>
<i>that you don't go back to jail.</i>

700
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:47,887
Tell my team to--
to skip the biopsy

701
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:51,140
and give the antibiotics
more time.

702
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:55,778
They're ready for us.

703
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:58,314
I drew a line in the sand,
and I won.

704
00:31:58,398 --> 00:31:59,448
We should be celebrating.

705
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,284
Do you need a few minutes?

706
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:02,952
You're right.
I keep getting better.

707
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,487
That's just it.

708
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:05,938
You won.

709
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:07,790
You made a demand that
could've blown up the deal,

710
00:32:07,874 --> 00:32:09,075
and you never
even asked me.

711
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:11,627
Deal didn't blow up.
They caved.

712
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,079
Joe, you say it
in your seminars.

713
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,114
Process matters
just as much as results.

714
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:17,133
Are you seriously
busting my chops

715
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:20,686
because I made one
little move without you?

716
00:32:20,754 --> 00:32:22,672
How 'bout stepping aside
and letting me

717
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:27,727
be the man in this
relationship for a change?

718
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:30,730
I really can't talk
to you right now.

719
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:37,803
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>why I said that.</i>

720
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:42,975
Just--I got so angry.

721
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:45,778
<i>Hopefully after this dose,</i>

722
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:50,482
<i>you'll start to feel better,</i>
<i>and we can get you home.</i>

723
00:32:52,836 --> 00:32:56,321
But I'd like to do
one more test.

724
00:32:56,373 --> 00:32:59,875
The testimony of one angry,
nearsighted neighbor

725
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,326
shouldn't outweigh
all other evidence.

726
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:02,661
Photos, utility bills--

727
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:04,663
Yes, because your clients
would never fake anything.

728
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:07,516
Uh, we acknowledge the neighbor
thing was a mistake,

729
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:09,101
but that doesn't mean that
all of the other documentation

730
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:10,335
should just be thrown out.

731
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:12,021
Look, look, you know,
I get that it's your job

732
00:33:12,105 --> 00:33:14,106
to try to act like there's
a case here, but shut up.

733
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:16,942
Okay.

734
00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:19,745
USCIS will be denying

735
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:20,846
Miss Petrova's
green card application.

736
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:23,015
You'll be referred
to immigration court

737
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,950
for deportation
proceedings,

738
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:25,901
and we're gonna inform
your parole officer

739
00:33:25,986 --> 00:33:28,520
<i>about evidence of fraud.</i>

740
00:33:28,572 --> 00:33:33,392
So unless anybody
has anything else to add...

741
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,385
Please, I am begging,
do not send him back to jail.

742
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:44,220
Maybe we have not lived
together all these--

743
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:45,805
Mrs. House, I have to advise
you not to continue.

744
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:47,056
This man and I,

745
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,540
did we marry for love?

746
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:49,558
No.

747
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:51,243
<i>But this past week,</i>

748
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:54,513
we have a lot of fun.

749
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,399
Working really hard to fool
the U.S. government, right?

750
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:57,400
Don't answer that.

751
00:33:57,484 --> 00:34:00,102
Way ahead of you.

752
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:02,271
It was fake, but...

753
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:04,156
It felt real.

754
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:08,244
Maybe because
it become real.

755
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:10,579
This man...

756
00:34:10,664 --> 00:34:13,199
My husband.

757
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,284
I want to stay with him,
but if I cannot,

758
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:20,089
please send me away,
and let him be free.

759
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:24,910
I love him.

760
00:34:40,393 --> 00:34:45,247
I didn't buy
a word you said.

761
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:49,768
But a judge might.

762
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,777
I'm gonna let you stay.

763
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:02,114
But for the next six months,
I'm gonna hold onto this file,

764
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:05,251
and our investigators
are gonna show up unannounced

765
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:07,419
at 6:00 a.m., 11:00 at night,
and they better find

766
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:09,922
the two of you sitting
on the couch watching <i>NCIS</i>

767
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:13,843
eating ice cream
from the same spoon.

768
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:15,678
Or both of you
will be sent to places

769
00:35:15,762 --> 00:35:20,566
far less pleasant
than New Jersey.

770
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:39,785
What you just
said in there...

771
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:41,203
Don't worry.

772
00:35:41,288 --> 00:35:43,372
I'm much too smart to be
falling in love with you.

773
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:48,177
I will be needing
extra shelf in bathroom.

774
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:57,269
Abdominal biopsy
showed flattened villi.

775
00:35:57,337 --> 00:35:59,939
Looks like you were
right about celiac.

776
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:02,358
You do remember
Chase got stabbed

777
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:03,776
doing a test House
didn't order?

778
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:06,061
Good comparison,
since both patients

779
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:07,563
were tweaked on steroids.

780
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:10,282
You only did this to score
points over Chase and Park.

781
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,517
We were right.

782
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:13,536
I proved it, and the patient
didn't bleed out.

783
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,787
Why are you being
a jerk about this?

784
00:36:14,854 --> 00:36:16,521
Let's go see
if House is back.

785
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:21,577
Patient's having
trouble breathing.

786
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:25,247
So much for celiac.

787
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:30,910
<i>His breathing</i>
<i>is stabilized,</i>

788
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:34,781
but his lung function is at 60%,
and his liver is tanking.

789
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:36,449
And he has major
symptoms of celiac

790
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,784
without actually
having celiac.

791
00:36:37,835 --> 00:36:39,586
Could be Whipple's.

792
00:36:39,637 --> 00:36:41,888
Doesn't explain
the incontinence.

793
00:36:41,955 --> 00:36:44,057
<i>Intestinal lymphoma?</i>

794
00:36:44,124 --> 00:36:46,125
Doesn't explain
the double vision.

795
00:36:46,177 --> 00:36:49,229
Any time you
want to jump in.

796
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:52,265
Is dance aerobics
even a thing?

797
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:53,400
I hear it's good
for the butt.

798
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:55,318
<i>What about</i>
<i>a parasitic infection?</i>

799
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:57,420
Strongyloides is known
to damage the small intestine.

800
00:36:57,488 --> 00:36:58,938
In this country,

801
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:00,073
he's about as likely
to get that as win Powerball.

802
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,492
Someone does win Powerball.
Every week.

803
00:37:02,576 --> 00:37:04,744
The patient went to Puerto Rico
a few months ago.

804
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:05,996
One of the few places
in the U.S.

805
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,247
You could pick up
Strongyloides.

806
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:08,615
Treatment is Ivermectin.

807
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,583
We give that to someone
with liver problems,

808
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:14,838
he could have
seizures, or worse.

809
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:24,531
Do it.

810
00:37:24,598 --> 00:37:28,234
I'm hearing a lot about
the value of compromise.

811
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:30,637
<i>But we don't live</i>
<i>on</i> Sesame Street,

812
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:33,673
<i>we live in the real--</i>

813
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:37,227
I was wondering if maybe
we overlooked a symptom,

814
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:39,229
or something.

815
00:37:39,313 --> 00:37:41,231
Makes perfect sense.

816
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:44,517
If you're the patient,
and "pantywaist" is the symptom.

817
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,521
Adams and I both thought
the patient could have celiac,

818
00:37:48,572 --> 00:37:52,826
but only she was willing to go
out on a limb and run the test.

819
00:37:52,877 --> 00:37:54,127
I gave up.

820
00:37:54,194 --> 00:37:57,630
Now you're in here
watching a motivational speech.

821
00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:01,033
Even your attempt to get
your balls back lacks balls.

822
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:03,937
<i>--World,</i>
<i>the business world.</i>

823
00:38:04,004 --> 00:38:06,873
If you're not a winner,
you're a loser.

824
00:38:06,924 --> 00:38:09,509
<i>His voice--it's lower</i>
<i>than it is now.</i>

825
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,760
If only there was
a good reason

826
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:12,178
for a professional speaker
to be hoarse.

827
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:13,713
Go open a pottery studio.

828
00:38:13,764 --> 00:38:18,451
Good point.

829
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:22,238
It's not a good point.
It's a decent point.

830
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:25,725
You're doing it again.
You have any other videos?

831
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:27,694
<i>Other seminars?</i>

832
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:29,195
When you see a weakness,

833
00:38:29,246 --> 00:38:31,698
<i>that's a time for strength.</i>

834
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:34,084
<i>A lot of people say,</i>
<i>"Oh, I feel bad about it.</i>

835
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:34,918
<i>The other guy</i>
<i>made a mistake."</i>

836
00:38:35,002 --> 00:38:36,870
You bailed too early.

837
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:39,422
Now I get all the credit.

838
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:41,424
<i>That kind of thinking is</i>
<i>what makes you have a bad day.</i>

839
00:38:44,044 --> 00:38:47,246
Chronic hoarseness

840
00:38:47,298 --> 00:38:49,182
<i>is a symptom</i>
<i>of a condition called</i>

841
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:50,917
silent thyroiditis.

842
00:38:50,968 --> 00:38:54,437
- But I'm not hoarse.
- Exactly.

843
00:38:54,522 --> 00:38:55,555
But you were
three years ago.

844
00:38:55,606 --> 00:38:57,757
Silent thyroiditis
comes and goes.

845
00:38:57,808 --> 00:39:00,143
And it, in turn,
is a symptom

846
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:03,947
of polyglandular autoimmune
syndrome type 3,

847
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:07,099
which makes this
a really bad idea.

848
00:39:10,154 --> 00:39:14,040
PAS 3 attacks the body's
own endocrine system,

849
00:39:14,107 --> 00:39:16,126
<i>moving from gland</i>
<i>to gland.</i>

850
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,328
<i>It started</i>
<i>in the thyroid,</i>

851
00:39:18,412 --> 00:39:19,946
<i>and probably helped along</i>
<i>by your low testosterone,</i>

852
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:21,714
<i>moved on to the gut.</i>

853
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:23,115
<i>Where it caused</i>
<i>celiac disease,</i>

854
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,367
or it would've if you weren't
on a gluten-free diet.

855
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:26,803
I was right.

856
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:30,490
This is incredibly
relevant.

857
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:32,392
<i>Eventually, PAS 3</i>
<i>attacked your thymus gland.</i>

858
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:35,645
You developed myasthenia gravis,
which landed you in here,

859
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:38,214
and you started eating gluten,
which only made things worse.

860
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:40,533
So am I gonna be okay?

861
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:41,334
<i>We'll treat</i>
<i>the various conditions</i>

862
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:43,203
with high-dose steroids.

863
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,021
<i>Assuming they respond,</i>
<i>you should be fine.</i>

864
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:48,808
And the testosterone?

865
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:52,612
Kicked in the nuts
is kicked in the nuts.

866
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:59,285
<i>Over the past week,</i>

867
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:02,755
<i>you've all had</i>
<i>good moments and bad.</i>

868
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:06,376
No one candidate

And so now,
we embark upon a contest

870
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:15,501
of medical strength,
stamina, and skill.

871
00:40:15,553 --> 00:40:16,769
Can we just
get this over with?

872
00:40:16,837 --> 00:40:17,887
<i>If the competitor</i>
<i>representing Australia</i>

873
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:19,672
would like to take
a point deduction,

874
00:40:19,723 --> 00:40:23,109
he should, by all means,
continue yapping.

875
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:24,360
Your glee is on
the verge of making this

876
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:25,445
not worth it
for any of us.

877
00:40:25,512 --> 00:40:27,881
Can I at least
light the torch?

878
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:29,682
Hurry.

880

number two competition.

882
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:46,132
all right.
Ready, set, suture!

883

T time.

884
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,279
What happens
if I don't take it?

885
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:01,347
Or at least go to
a much lower dose?

886
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:02,381
Are you having
side effects?

887
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:05,151
No, I feel great.
Faster, clearer.

888
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:09,405
More like myself.

889
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,291
But my marriage
and my career,

890
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,410
they're both built
on me being somebody else.

891
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:15,745
Low testosterone
can cause depression

892
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:17,563
and problems sleeping.

893
00:41:17,615 --> 00:41:19,132
It's also been
linked to conditions

894
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:23,536
such as osteoporosis
and diabetes.

895
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:25,788
It'll make your life harder
and more dangerous

896
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:30,310
on top of all the meds
you'll be taking.

897
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:34,280
I'll take that risk.

898
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:41,387
I'm a better man
without it.
