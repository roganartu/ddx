Hey, what was that?

4
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:53,471
Hatchet, hatchet, hatchet!

5
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,642
<i>Come on, Toros.</i>
<i>Let's make some noise!</i>

6
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,678
Nice to meet the pride
of Trois-Rivieres.

7
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,813
I still got your Wings
rookie card.

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,098
So what's that worth?

9
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:04,266
It's a collector's item.

10
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,400
They don't make them
like you anymore.

11
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:06,935
So do you wanna go?

12
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,105
Square up.
Good luck.

13
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,926
He didn't get
a hand on you?

14
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:35,714
You're going to be
a force in the show.

15
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:40,084
Whoo!

16
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:41,386
Boo!

17
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:42,687
Come on, Toros!

18
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,443

Birthday present for someone

31
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:05,720
22-year-old enforcer
with hemoptysis.

32
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:06,938
He's a hockey player?

33
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,523
No, he's a superhero.

34
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:09,941
<i>He's coughing up blood</i>

35
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:11,943

while breaking
someone else's rib

37
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:16,448
and puncturing their lung
in the name of sport.

38
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:18,650
Nice conclusion to which
the E.R. already jumped

39
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,652
<i>18 hours ago.</i>

40
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:22,520
Short man

41
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:25,123
I was average height as a kid
and never bullied.

<i>Until now.</i>

43
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,310
X-ray ruled out
traumatic sequelae,

44
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,746
overt TB,
and lung cancer.

45
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:33,548
Sarcoidosis.
Nodules could be too small

46
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:35,550
to show up on an X-ray.

47
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,052
Fighting's the best part
of hockey.

48
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,837
<i>Without it, you've got</i>
<i>the Ice Capades.</i>

49
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:40,722
Fighting has nothing
to do with hockey.

50
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,574
It's like the cheerleaders
at a basketball game.

51
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,259
<i>Cheerleading's the best part</i>
<i>of basketball.</i>

52
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:46,811

Basketball.

53
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,513
<i>He's a duck hunter.</i>

54
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:50,181
He could've contracted
psittacosis

55
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:51,516
from exposure
to fowl.

56
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:54,051
He had three teeth
knocked out two weeks ago.

57
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,987
Infection could've led
to oral bleeding.

58
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:57,439
Not without continuing
dental pain.

59
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:58,890
<i>Then he took an elbow</i>

60
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:01,659
to the gut, which caused
an esophageal tear.

61
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:04,329
Chase, CT the patient.
Check for sarcoid.

62
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:05,497
Adams, sputum cultures

63
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:07,782
and serologies for psittacosis.
Taub...

64
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:10,085
I'd tell you why
I think your theory

65
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,120
is not just wrong
but ill-conceived,

66
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,405
but it's more fun to prove it

67
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,257
by having you check
the stool for blood.

68
00:04:16,342 --> 00:04:19,043
And while we wait
for the stool fairy,

69
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:21,463
I'm a man down,
so you want to drop your pants

70
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:24,299
and hit the ice.

71
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:26,885
<i>The faster you guys</i>
<i>can do this, the better.</i>

72
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:28,603
The NHL's been
sniffing around,

73
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:32,307
and being in the hospital is not
really helping my marketability.

74
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:34,159
You have to be pretty good
to get called up.

75
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:36,027
Yeah, leading the league
in penalty minutes.

76
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,663
And visits to the E.R., not
counting the ones you've caused.

77
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:40,632
Not a hockey fan,
I gather?

78
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:41,699
<i>I am.</i>
<i>That's the point.</i>

79
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,568
Fighting cheapens
a great sport.

80
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:45,102
Oh, come on,
that's like saying

81
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:47,972
passing cheapens football.
It's part of the game.

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,374
I don't cause injuries.

83
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,792
They're self-inflicted?

84
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:51,826
No, I prevent them.

85
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:54,278
<i>I take the hit</i>

86
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,080
so the smaller guys
don't have to.

87
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:59,167
I thought
you'd appreciate that.

88
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:14,732
Neighbor's baby again?

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,103
I could hear it through
earplugs, two pillows,

90
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:22,807
<i>and three sleeping pills.</i>

91
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,411
Hmm.

92
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,763
What is wrong
with you?

93
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,417
I just said, "hmm."

94
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:33,618
<i>You're trying</i>
<i>to figure out</i>

95
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,319
some deeper significance
to my having

96
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:36,588
a couple
of crappy nights.

97
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:42,159
Which one of us is analyzing
the word "hmm" here?

98
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:44,495
Fine.
Sorry.

99
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:47,599
Apology accepted.

100
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,967
<i>However...</i>
Mm.

101
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:50,835
It's not the crying
that's keeping you awake.

102
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:52,854
<i>The sound</i>
<i>of a needy child</i>

103
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,839
is stirring
your paternal juices.

104
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,508
<i>The sound</i>
<i>of a needy child</i>

105
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:59,777
at 112 decibels has stirred
my inner murderer.

106
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:00,862
<i>Don't mess with me.</i>

107
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,747
Explain the stains
on your shirt.

108
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:05,183
<i>You're lactating.</i>

109
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:08,236
The fact that you're the only
fruit on your family tree

110
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,188
is getting to you.

111
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,360
It's not a big deal.

112
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:18,162
So I'll probably
never be a dad.

113
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:21,249
It's--
it sucks.

114
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,867
I'll lose a little sleep,
but--

115
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,137
You're not supposed to feel bad
when you dodge a bullet.

116
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:27,755
It's like you got
survivor's guilt.

117
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,140
<i>There are</i>
<i>actually things</i>

118
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:31,375
in this world that give life
even more meaning

119
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:32,977
than soap operas
and monster trucks.

120
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:36,247
<i>And we happen to be missing out</i>
<i>on at least one of them.</i>

121
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:44,822
Remember the falconer?

122
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:48,576
Beth?

123
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:50,912
You dated two falconers?
Yes, Beth.

124
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,951
The night the two
of you split up,

125
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:58,803
you came around
to my place,

126
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:04,609
wallowing in self-pity
and Tequila.

127
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:06,010
You passed out.

128
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:11,082
She called that night,
asked me to give you a message.

129
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:14,218
She said
she was pregnant...

130
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:19,724
Which, God
and Planned Parenthood willing,

131
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:23,962
means you are the father
of an 11-year-old.

132
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,634
I told you
the next morning...

133
00:07:29,702 --> 00:07:32,770
Hypothetically.

134
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:35,206
I asked you how you'd feel
if Beth had gotten pregnant,

135
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:36,607
and you said,
and I quote,

136
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,712
"It would be the worst mistake
of my life."

137
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:46,951
And...
Scene.

138
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:49,253
Two performances Sunday,
dark mondays?

139
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,309
Just as well.

140
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:08,305
I want to kill
my mother.

141
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,024
My Popo's on her own,

142
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:14,812
and my mother always needs me
to take care of her.

143
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:17,915
Well, you could kill
Popo instead.

144
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:19,484
I have to take
her shopping,

145
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,869
to her friends,
to Atlantic City.

146
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:23,821
I love her,
but every night,

147
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,322
every weekend...

148
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:26,841
And only if there was
some solution,

149
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,477
someplace
where you could live...

150
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:30,678
that's not there.

151
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:32,080
My mom would freak.

152
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:35,183
It would be the ultimate sign
of disrespect.

153
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,935
Okay.
Then stay.

154
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:40,054
And maybe you consider
not bitching about it?

155
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,708
Not everyone's lucky enough
to have your independence.

156
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:45,777
Don't worry.

157
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:47,745
When you lose your family,
you'll have it too.

158
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:52,450
He doesn't have
sarcoid.

159
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:53,684
Look at that.

160
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,386
That's his spleen.
I know.

161
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:58,373
But he's gotten it
supersized.

162
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:00,041
Deep vein thrombosis
caused by any one of

163
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,692
his many injuries
or surgeries.

164
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:02,994
Leukemia's
a better fit.

165
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:04,295
We have a guy
who is punishing

166
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:05,830
his body
on a daily basis.

167
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,632
Don't you think that's a more
likely cause than cancer?

168
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,718
No, because she doesn't have
an agenda.

169
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:12,470
Well, that was
incredibly unprofessional.

170
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:16,090
Well, it was really
Taub's fault.

171
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:17,392
If you're not prepared
to slam her into the boards,

172
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:18,926
she's got no reason
not to go after you.

173
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:23,181
Might I suggest pulling
her jersey over her head first?

174
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:25,983
We should get an ultrasound
for DVT and WBC for leukemia.

175
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,389
You think
I could have cancer?

176
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:35,860
More likely,
it's just a DVT.

177
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:41,899
This is my agent.
I gotta get this, man.

178
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,753
Give me some good news,
Kenny.

179
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:48,539
I thought
you said any day.

180
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,341
Okay.

181
00:09:50,408 --> 00:09:52,710
All right.

182
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:58,582
I gotta go.

183
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:22,240
I called Beth.

184
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,084
I have an 11-year-old son.

185
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:45,256
Liver failure could alter
hormone levels,

186
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:46,190
cause abnormal breast
development.

187
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,443
<i>Alcoholism.</i>

188
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:51,980
We should search his home
and locker room.

189
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:53,764
Note that the person
who wants to search the home

190
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:55,199
didn't sleep in one last night.

191
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:58,069
You have the imprint of
a seatbelt buckle in your cheek.

192
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,940
I got in a fight
with my mother.

193
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:06,044
She hit you
with a seatbelt?

194
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,328
Could be
hemochromatosis.

195
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:08,579
<i>Explains the liver</i>
<i>and the spleen,</i>

196
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,098
but hemoptysis is a stretch.

197
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:11,499
What about leptospirosis?

198
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,917
<i>That's a good fit,</i>

199
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:14,185
if you ignore the fact
that he's a pro athlete

200
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,004
who looks like
the Incredible Hulk,

201
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:17,355
<i>which means he's gotta be</i>
<i>on steroids,</i>

202
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:18,723
which is a better fit.

203
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,309
All we really know for sure
is it was his evil job

204
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:22,393
<i>that caused the problems.</i>

205
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:23,761
Yes, I don't like him.

206
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,096
Doesn't mean
my judgment's affected.

207
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:27,899
Maybe. Let's take a look
at the instant replay.

208
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,600
This is the hit
that precipitated

209
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,270
Booby Orr's fight.

210
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:34,522
Dirty or clean?

211
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,992
The hit was clean.

212
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:39,110
<i>Really?</i>

213
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:40,778
The guy
released the puck

214
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:42,497
at least a second
before the hit.

215
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:44,482
We have a difference of opinion.
That's all.

216
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,618
Absolutely.

217
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:49,837
Maybe she's as biased as you.

218
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:51,956
Or maybe the entire league is.

219
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:55,043
After review, the league
disciplinary commissioner

220
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:57,045
ruled the hit
illegal and dangerous

221
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:59,097
and suspended the player
for three games.

222
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:01,883
Adams and Taub,
run antibody titers for lepto.

223
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:03,601
<i>Chase and Park,</i>
<i>check out the home,</i>

224
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:05,937
the locker room
for booze, steroids,

225
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:09,524
and Taub's objectivity.

226
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,860
At least you're free.

227
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,529
Going to get
your own place?

228
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:16,847
If I can find a place
I can afford,

229
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,017
so...no.

230
00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:23,154
If you want,

231
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:24,789
you can crash
at my place

232
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:26,207
in the spare bedroom.

233
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,494
That might be
kind of weird.

234
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:31,862
I live in an apartment,
not a dungeon.

235
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:35,666
It's just two single people,
opposite sex. I--

236
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:38,970
Your bedroom door has
a lock on the inside.

237
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:49,564
Hey, if you prefer your car,
be my guest.

238
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:56,320
Scrip for Ganciclovir.

239
00:12:56,388 --> 00:13:01,392
If his neighbor has mono,
could mean he has mono.

240
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:06,030
If he has mono, explains
his spleen and hemoptysis.

241
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:08,566
And it's caused
by Epstein-Barr virus,

242
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:11,235
which explains his liver.

243
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:15,957
And my moonroof leaks.

244
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,708
Thank you.

245
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:25,016
Why don't we just assume
that you're not the dad?

246
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:30,972
Either you're the dad,
or she cheated on you

247
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:32,140
with your dad.

248
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:34,692
Oh!
Sand art.

249
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,310
I used to love this.

250
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:40,031
He's bitter,
not mentally handicapped.

251
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:41,983
Who knows what Beth
told him about you?

252
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:43,367
At worst,
you're a rapist.

253
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:46,120
At best,
you're a rapist.

254
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,823
Maybe she said I was
a dead war hero.

255
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:52,210
Raised by a lunatic mother
and abandoned by his father.

256
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:54,629
Oh, I know!
Squirrel handcuffs.

257
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:56,247
You think he's gotten
any of those?

258
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:58,749
If you really wanted me to do
nothing with this information,

259
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,001
then why did you
give it to me?

260
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:02,420
Because you were pining
for a kid,

261
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:05,122
and you deserved to know
that you already had one.

262
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:08,142
But your parental cravings are
more theoretical than applied.

263
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:11,262
You want
vicarious immortality

264
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:13,564
more than you want
a lifelong burden.

265
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,349
You're assuming
he's going to be a nightmare.

266
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:16,350
What if he's a good kid?

267
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:19,153
He's a kid.

268
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:21,772
Best you can hope for
is he's a nightmare.

269
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:23,157
House, I'm not naive.

270
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:25,526
I realize that this thing
could go very badly,

271
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:28,079
but the point is
my son wants to meet me.

272
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:31,999
And I want to meet him.

273
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,976
Popo, I presume.

274
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:06,067
<i>Hey, uh,</i>

275
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:07,702
I let myself in.

276
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:09,070
Um, this is--

277
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:11,405
We've met.

278
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,161
I thought the whole point of
this was to get away from Popo.

279
00:15:17,212 --> 00:15:18,713
My dad's getting
a cyst removed,

280
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:21,332
and my mother had to take him
to the clinic.

281
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,718
Don't worry.
She'll be gone in an hour.

282
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:26,870
I'm not worried,
because it's not my issue.

283
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:30,391
She seems awfully quiet.

284
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:33,561
You haven't seen her drunk.

285
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:49,193
<i>Bobby?</i>

286
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:04,961
I found him crying
in the fetal position.

287
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,329
<i>It's not a new symptom.</i>

288
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,697
<i>He's crying because</i>
<i>his liver failure</i>

289
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:09,082
<i>threw his hormones</i>
<i>out of whack.</i>

290
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,551
Aside from the crying, he's
actually recovering nicely.

291
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:13,086
<i>Aside from the guy</i>
<i>in the book depository,</i>

292
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,672
<i>the Kennedys had</i>
<i>a lovely trip to Dallas.</i>

293
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:16,890
Repetitive blows
to the head

294
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:19,342
can cause chronic
traumatic encephalopathy,

295
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:21,344
symptoms of which are aggressive
behavior and depression.

296
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,047
So your theory is that
his aggressive behavior

297
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:25,098
caused his aggressive behavior.

298
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:26,566
<i>He's not depressed.</i>

299
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,384
He's just bummed
because he knows

300
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:31,054
he's a talentless moron
who's only one lost fight

301
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:33,406
away from being a barista.

302
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:35,075
I understand that can get
to a guy after a while.

303
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,446
If he quits being an enforcer,
it could save his life.

304
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,864
You don't want
to save his life.

305
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:43,249
You want to kill his career.

306
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:48,621
I moved into Chase's apartment.

307
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,673
He knows. He was staring
at our matching cups.

308
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,876
<i>I told you</i>
<i>we should split up.</i>

309
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:57,013
We're not having sex.
With each other..

310
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,181
Yet.

311
00:16:58,248 --> 00:16:59,582
Yes.

312
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:00,650
Yes?

313
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:02,552
<i>I just mean no one knows</i>

314
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:05,421
the future right now,
so we don't really know--

315
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:11,061
The only conclusive test

316
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:13,596
<i>for CTE is post-mortem.</i>

317
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:14,948
<i>But an MRI of his brain</i>

318
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,733
<i>could reveal</i>
<i>white matter disintegrity,</i>

319
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:19,319
<i>which is the effect of CTE.</i>

320
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,121
Why? Are you trying
to sleep with her?

321
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,456
'Cause the simpler technique
is just to ask.

322
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,375
I was doing something nice.
Mm, no.

323
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:28,277
Th--mm.
No, that doesn't fit.

324
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,445
<i>He's only had</i>
<i>three concussions</i>

325
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:30,613
since he was ten.

326
00:17:30,664 --> 00:17:32,415
It's not enough to cause CTE.

327
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,000
Three reported
concussions.

328
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,685
These guys are taught in high
school how to dupe the tests.

329
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:36,719
Guilt?

330
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:38,138
This is really insulting.

331
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:39,489
<i>It's not guilt.</i>

332
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,357
Park is a friend.

333
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:43,093
So it's guilt.

334
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,894
<i>Chase convinced you</i>
<i>to leave mommy,</i>

335
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:48,098
and now he feels
responsible.

336
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:50,650
<i>No MRI.</i>
<i>Do a psych eval.</i>

337
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:53,703
If he doesn't start weeping
again, send him home.

338
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:01,945
<i>Dr. Wilson?</i>

339
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:07,450
Duncan.

340
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:08,618
Uh, James.

341
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:12,455
Uh, n-n-nice
to meet you.

342
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:14,424
It's nice to meet you.

343
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:18,928
Um...

344
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:21,131
How are you doing?

345
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:23,133
Good.

346
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:27,971
Good.

347
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:30,440
I got you this.

348
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:33,393
Oh.

349
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:36,062
Thank you.

350
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:37,197
Go ahead.

351
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:40,683
Okay.

352
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:44,888
It's got three games
built in,

353
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,573
but you can download more
from the website.

354
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:48,541
Yeah, I know.

355
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,994
You already have one.

356
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,196
I can always use
a backup.

357
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:54,797
Hi, can I start you
with something to drink?

358
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:56,365
Just water,
please.

359
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,934
You got a Gamedeck?

360
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:00,803
<i>Way to go, Dad.</i>

361
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:07,210
According to
your psych eval,

362
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:10,647
the only thing happier than you
is Disneyland.

363
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,615
I'm sorry you had to see me
like that last night.

364
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:15,718
I'm just upset about being
in the hospital and...

365
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,153
I'm on some weird meds,

366
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,488
but they must be working,

367
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:21,908
because I'm feeling
a lot better now.

368
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:24,511
Depression could be the symptom
of a serious illness.

369
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:26,246
CTE.

370
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,865
Yeah, my aunt sends me every
article she can find on it.

371
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,034
And you know
it could kill you.

372
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,452
In the long run,
like a lot of things.

373
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:33,503
<i>You might be right.</i>

374
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,905
And an MRI
could confirm that.

375
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:40,109
I have enough evidence of head
trauma in my file already, so...

376
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:46,099
My mom said you had trouble
maintaining relationships

377
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:49,802
with normal people.

378
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,472
She also said
you were a nice guy.

379
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:54,190
I always figured
she was lying

380
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:56,192
'cause she didn't want me
to hate my deadbeat dad.

381
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,394
I didn't know--

382
00:19:58,462 --> 00:19:59,812
I-I know...

383
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:00,980
Now.

384
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:09,405
You're a bright kid.
Thanks to you.

385
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:13,109
Thanks to my mom, I'm also
a big, soft-hearted wuss.

386
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,462
I think you may have
gotten that from both of us.

387
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:24,170
Uh, I gotta go, but it was
really nice meeting you.

388
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:26,139
It was nice meeting you,
Duncan.

389
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:29,259
Uh, you want
to hang out again?

390
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,477
Absolutely.

391
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,813
Tonight?

392
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:36,149
Tonight?

393
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:41,037
Well, I-I--
there's, um...

394
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:42,989
That would be great.

395
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:45,408
Okay.

396
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:48,311
I'll text you.

397
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,670
Thank you.
How did you talk him into it?

398
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:00,640
He agreed once I promised
him anonymity.

399
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,376
Mr. and Mrs. Doe liked
the name John apparently.

400
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,129
Unfortunately we just wasted
his time and proved House right.

401
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:07,847
Nothing?

402
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,967
What about that?

403
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:12,935
That's an artifact.

404
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:15,471
That's a density.

405
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:17,223
I know you think
I'm convincing myself,

406
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:19,508
<i>but this brain has been</i>
<i>hammered for years,</i>

407
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,012
meaning evidence may be subtle,
but it's there.

408
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:25,982
<i>Meaning you see</i>
<i>what you want to see.</i>

409
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:28,701
Unless, of course,

410
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:31,321
Chase is an idiot,
and I do have brain damage.

411
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:38,194
Patient's stroking out.

412
00:21:38,245 --> 00:21:39,529
<i>Chase?</i>

413
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:40,630
Can you get me out of--

414
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:42,965
Ohh...

415
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:44,870
Hello?

416
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,790
The good news is,

417
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:53,292
it's isolated
ophthalmoplegia,

418
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:55,044
which means you
didn't have a stroke.

419
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:56,996
Bad news is,
Taub was right.

420
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,582
You're still sick.

421
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,667
I said "right,"
not "competent."

422
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:04,220
<i>Bursts your CTE bubble.</i>

423
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,622
You're going to need a whole
new theory to keep Uncle Jesse

424
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,074
<i>and his Olsen twins</i>
<i>on the bench.</i>

425
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:11,344
Can we discuss my incompetence
somewhere else?

426
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:15,064
Dr. House.

427
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:17,900
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

428
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:36,786
Could be neurosyphilis.

429
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:38,087
He's only 22.

430
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:40,122
And he's been on the road
since he was 14.

431
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,593
So he was trash
even before he was trash?

432
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,128
You curious about
what he wanted?

433
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,630
I assume he wanted me
off the case,

434
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:50,165
and you told him I was hit
in the head as a child,

435
00:22:50,217 --> 00:22:53,102
and your mother made you promise
to take care of me.

436
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:55,188
He was doing what
he always does--

437
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:57,390
sticking up
for the little guy.

438
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:01,227
He told me
to apologize to you,

439
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:05,448
or he would excrete down
my throat.

440
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:06,532
I'm paraphrasing.

441
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:09,184
So if he should ask,
I was a gentleman,

442
00:23:09,236 --> 00:23:11,571
or I will excrete down
your throat.

443
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,207
Microscopic polyangiitis fits.

444
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,909
We should start plasmapheresis
immediately.

445
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:19,528
We need to run an ANCA panel
to confirm first.

446
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,464
Putting him on plasmapheresis
could make him bleed out.

447
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:23,132
MPA can progress quickly.

448
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:26,385
We may not have time
before it reaches his lungs.

449
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,221
I think you're right.

450
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:30,840
Thus confirming
my objectivity.

451
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:33,759
Start the treatment.

452
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:46,388
Miserable yet?

453
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,443
He's polite, well-adjusted,
and a straight-A student.

454
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:53,562
Which means
he doesn't need you.

455
00:23:53,614 --> 00:23:55,748
So why don't you get out
while the butterfly effect

456
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:57,383
is still
in the cocoon stage?

457
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:58,751
I'm making him dinner.

458
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:00,169
You don't make
an 11-year-old dinner.

459
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:03,706
You give him a jar
of peanut butter.

460
00:24:03,757 --> 00:24:04,874
It'll be fine.

461
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:07,176
I could give this kid
a quinoa salad,

462
00:24:07,243 --> 00:24:09,211
and he would eat it
just to be nice.

463
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:11,097
'Cause he's a gutless placater,
just like his dad.

464
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:13,382
He's nice.

465
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,217
This is
a terrible idea.

466
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:16,302
Because we like
each other?

467
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:18,054
Yes.

468
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:20,006
'Cause of the statement
"we like each other."

469
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:21,474
You've known him
25 minutes.

470
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:24,259
All you know about him is that
he'd lie about a quinoa salad,

471
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:25,594
whatever the hell
that is.

472
00:24:25,646 --> 00:24:29,031
You're jealous
of an 11-year-old

473
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:31,067
because you are
an 11-year-old.

474
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:44,664
So tell me
about yourself.

475
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:46,882
I mean,
you're smart,

476
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,085
you're nice,
but what else?

477
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:51,320
I don't know.
I'm a kid.

478
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:56,309
Right.

479
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:59,261
What are you
looking for?

480
00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:01,814
Nothing.

481
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:07,653
You want...
peanut butter?

482
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:09,221
Do you have
prosciutto?

483
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:12,274
You like prosciutto?

484
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:13,492
I'm weird.
No, no.

485
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,578
I--
I like it too.

486
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:17,479
I've got some in the fridge.
How about goat cheese?

487
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:20,866
I love goat cheese.

488
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,879
I think that was
the best pizza I ever had.

489
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:36,165
It was the hint
of dijon.

490
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:41,354
Do you have any aunts
or uncles or grandparents?

491
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:44,273
My mom got into some stupid
fight with my grandfather.

492
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,608
They all
kind of cut us off.

493
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:46,726
Hmm.

494
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,844
<i>Are you talking</i>
<i>to your parents?</i>

495
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:52,365
Yes, and they're going
to be very surprised

496
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:53,983
and excited
to meet you.

497
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:56,035
That's awesome.

498
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,405
You have arrived
at your destination.

499
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:00,289
Well--

500
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:01,574
Thanks for the pizza.

501
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:03,659
Sure, sure.
It was, uh--

502
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,661
I mean, it was great
to spend time with you and--

503
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:11,033
I love you, Dad.

504
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:38,360
Can't be easy
doing what you do.

505
00:26:38,412 --> 00:26:41,447
I mean,
do you love it?

506
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:42,615
Is it fun?

507
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:48,671
I had my own
plastic surgery practice

508
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:50,372
making lots of money,

509
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:52,374
but I wasn't happy.

510
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:55,244
It wasn't what I went
to med school for.

511
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:12,695
Every winter my dad would flood
the backyard and made a rink.

512
00:27:12,762 --> 00:27:15,364
I was Lemieux.
My little brother was Gretzky.

513
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:17,066
I was good.

514
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:20,152
I won the NDHA scoring title
three years in a row.

515
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:22,838
<i>I kept getting bigger</i>

516
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:26,108
and stronger and better...

517
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,476
till I didn't.

518
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:30,279
<i>Juniors coach</i>
<i>told me that,</i>

519
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,634
if I wanted to stay on the team,
then I'd have to use my size.

520
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,370
Every game, I got
less and less ice time

521
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:43,392
until it was all fighting
and no hockey.

522
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:48,898
<i>I, uh...</i>

523
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:52,268
There's something going on
with my arms.

524
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:57,356
I can't feel them.
I--

525
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,974
<i>Doctor, I can't feel</i>
<i>my arms.</i>

526
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,790
Patient's arms
are now paralyzed.

527
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:04,971
ANCA panel
was negative.

528
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:06,640
It's not MPA.

529
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:08,174
Lyme disease
could cause paralysis.

530
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:10,026
<i>If he was hunting,</i>
<i>he'd be exposed to ticks.</i>

531
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:13,980
No target rash
or cardiac involvement.

532
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:17,317
Roomies with benefits
keeping you up?

533
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:19,486
Cribbage.

534
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:20,537
Played with Park's Popo.

535
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:23,540
Is that two
separate events?

536
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:25,358
Grandmother.

537
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,193
<i>ALS could explain</i>
<i>the symptoms.</i>

538
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:28,628
Sensory involvement
rules out ALS.

539
00:28:28,696 --> 00:28:30,130
Okay, yeah.
This is interesting.

540
00:28:30,197 --> 00:28:31,548
We'll get back to
the patient in a second.

541
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:34,384
<i>Your issue is the same</i>
<i>as Wilson's, except...</i>

542
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:37,554
you're haunted by the
pitter-patter of tiny skanks.

543
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:38,805
<i>You don't feel guilty</i>

544
00:28:38,873 --> 00:28:40,373
about getting Park
thrown out of her home.

545
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:43,477
You feel guilty about all the
women that you've screwed over.

546
00:28:43,544 --> 00:28:46,062
My mother needs 1,000 bucks
for snow tires.

547
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:48,398
Park's a friend.
Popo's fun.

548
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:51,768
Paralysis has gone
from his face to his arms,

549
00:28:51,853 --> 00:28:53,386
meaning it's descending,
which is the hallmark

550
00:28:53,438 --> 00:28:55,856
of botulism.

551
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:59,326
So it was something he ate.
How innocuous.

552
00:28:59,393 --> 00:29:01,561
You've overcome your bias
by reversing it.

553
00:29:01,612 --> 00:29:03,997
The only problem is that
being in love with a patient

554
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:06,416
is just as judgmental
as being in hate.

555
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:07,701
We didn't find
any contaminated--

556
00:29:07,752 --> 00:29:10,086
No contaminated food.
I'm not an idiot.

557
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:13,072
But what if it's not from
ingesting but from injecting?

558
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:15,342
He was treated
for intractable muscle spasms

559
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:16,426
by the team's trainers.

560
00:29:16,511 --> 00:29:19,346
Sometimes they use Botox.

561
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:20,797
We need to start
the antitoxin--

562
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:22,933
The antitoxin
could cause anaphylaxis.

563
00:29:23,017 --> 00:29:25,135
We need to test first
to confirm.

564
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:27,053
<i>As if to prove my point,</i>
<i>last time you said</i>

565
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:28,588
there wasn't enough time
to test

566
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:29,873
prior to a more
dangerous treatment.

567
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:32,008
<i>It's a different situation,</i>

568
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:33,176
different symptom,
different diagnosis.

569
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:35,161
Different emotion.

570
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:38,098
Give him the antitoxin.

571
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:44,804
Anything?

572
00:29:44,872 --> 00:29:47,707
No adverse effects.

573
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,253
<i>Chase let me</i>
<i>move in with him</i>

574
00:30:00,304 --> 00:30:01,755
to get away
from my grandmother.

575
00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:03,924
Then he practically let
my grandmother

576
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:05,725
move in with
the both of us.

577
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,845
He's being way more
than nice.

578
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,965
Then which answer is it?

579
00:30:12,016 --> 00:30:14,851
Chase feels guilty
for pushing you to move out?

580
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:16,135
He didn't push me.

581
00:30:16,187 --> 00:30:18,088
Guilt about skanks?
He loves skanks.

582
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:19,439
It's not the other option.

583
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,858
There are people
that like me.

584
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:23,643
<i>People even want</i>
<i>to sleep with me.</i>

585
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:25,662
Some of them are
even good-looking.

586
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,146
That good-looking?

587
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,288
Did you see that?

588
00:30:41,495 --> 00:30:43,396
You're feeling
something?

589
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:45,048
Yeah.

590
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:52,272
I could give you crap
for making me wait 11 years,

591
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:53,690
but instead I'm going
to thank you

592
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:57,944
for not making me
wait another 11.

593
00:30:58,012 --> 00:31:00,513
Every little girl
wants a pony

594
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:02,115
till they have to clean up
after it.

595
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:03,349
You think I'm going
to quit on this?

596
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:05,535
On an 11-year-old?

597
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,703
The only relationship
you haven't quit on

598
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:07,904
has been with me.

599
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:10,624
Hmm. A needy,
truculent narcissist.

600
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:13,577
I think it's been perfect
training for parenthood.

601
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:16,546
That's not even close.

602
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:19,799
This is the rest
of your life.

603
00:31:21,385 --> 00:31:24,754
You screw this up,
you don't get to run away.

604
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,256
You get to ruin
both your lives.

605
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,009
This is a bigger responsibility
than any you've ever taken on

606
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,177
and screwed up.

607
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:36,766
I know.

608
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:39,586
That's why I'm so
excited about it.

609
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:49,913
You're really happier doing this
than looking at boobs all day?

610
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:52,916
Luckily I get patients like you
every now and again

611
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,085
who let me
reexperience the joy.

612
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:59,372
You know, the best part
of my day is when I'm sitting

613
00:31:59,423 --> 00:32:03,209
in that penalty box
after I beat someone up.

614
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,596
That's the only time
I know I'm safe.

615
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:08,214
Think Lemieux
ever felt that way?

616
00:32:08,265 --> 00:32:09,883
I'm not going back.

617
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:10,884
<i>To hockey?</i>

618
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:12,302
To enforcing...

619
00:32:12,386 --> 00:32:14,187
Whatever that costs.

620
00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:17,891
Good for you.

621
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:19,258
Ooh!

622
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,611
First goal
for the pocket rocket.

623
00:32:23,564 --> 00:32:26,700
Bobby?

624
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:28,902
We need a team
in here!

625
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:35,423
He's completely paralyzed,

626
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:38,293
and he tested negative
for botulism.

627
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:45,800
I am now accepting
long shots.

628
00:32:45,852 --> 00:32:47,352
Polio.

629
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,020
<i>Some kids were</i>
<i>never vaccinated.</i>

630
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:50,972
Unless they played sports
all their lives

631
00:32:51,023 --> 00:32:52,440
and had two physicals
a year.

632
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:54,326
How about MLD?

633
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,777
<i>That's a bad fit.</i>

634
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:58,780
I say that not because
there's no treatment for MLD

635
00:32:58,831 --> 00:33:00,081
but because it's a bad fit.

636
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:01,666
His cognitive abilities
are unaffected.

637
00:33:01,751 --> 00:33:04,652
Prion disease could explain
the waxing and waning symptoms.

638
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:06,121
The test for Prions
is a brain biopsy.

639
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:08,590
Given his history, there's
got to be brain swelling.

640
00:33:08,657 --> 00:33:10,625
We can't risk drilling
into his skull.

641
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:12,493
Pretty sure
we can.

642
00:33:12,545 --> 00:33:15,163
We also could keep talking
until we can find

643
00:33:15,214 --> 00:33:16,798
an answer
we all can agree on.

644
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:18,300
All of us?

645
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:20,518
Those who love him,
those who hate him,

646
00:33:20,603 --> 00:33:22,854
those who don't give a crap
about him or you--

647
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:24,839
Or I could just discuss it
on my own with Foreman.

648
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:28,026
He's not your friend.
I get it.

649
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,477
He's a patient.
I'm not--

650
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:31,730
He never had your back.

651
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:38,536
He didn't insist that
I apologize to you.

652
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:40,739
He asked me to take you
off the case.

653
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:50,415
Biopsy his brain.

654
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,373
Hey, Dad.

655
00:33:58,424 --> 00:34:00,308
Hey.

656
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:01,977
Sorry I'm late.

657
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:03,345
Got in a fight
with my mom.

658
00:34:03,396 --> 00:34:04,712
She's such a tool.

659
00:34:04,764 --> 00:34:06,314
I'm sure
she means well.

660
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:08,283
She wants to open
a reserve in Costa Rica

661
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:12,153
for rescued
birds of prey.

662
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:13,939
But how serious is she?

663
00:34:14,023 --> 00:34:19,611
From my recollection, she used
to talk about doing a lot--

664
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:21,613
Yeah, but she bought
plane tickets for Monday.

665
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:30,588
Well, Costa Rica
is beautiful.

666
00:34:30,673 --> 00:34:32,674
And the schools
are supposed to be great.

667
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:33,959
Oh, I'm not going.

668
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:35,477
It's her stupid dream,
not mine.

669
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:39,147
Then what will you do?

670
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:44,052
Uh...

671
00:34:44,103 --> 00:34:49,441
I-I thought
maybe I could, uh...

672
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:52,427
Maybe I could stay
with you?

673
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:55,096
Uh, y-your place is only
3 miles away from my school.

674
00:34:55,147 --> 00:34:56,314
I could bus it every day.

675
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,766
And I do my own laundry.

676
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,284
I keep my room tidy.

677
00:34:59,368 --> 00:35:02,454
Duncan,
th-this--

678
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:05,606
This is very sudden.

679
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:08,710
I know.

680
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:11,613
I'm sorry.

681
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:18,353
Please don't send me
to the jungle.

682
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,129
If it's okay with your mother,
it's okay with me.

683
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:42,494
Take me off the case.

684
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:45,646
I've obviously completely
lost my objectivity.

685
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:48,333
I'm not helping,
I'm not even neutral.

686
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:51,586
Agreed.

687
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:53,538
So why shouldn't I take you
off all my cases?

688
00:35:53,622 --> 00:35:56,591
Because you were right.
I hate bullies.

689
00:35:56,658 --> 00:35:58,543
You work for me.

690
00:35:58,627 --> 00:35:59,844
You're not a bully.

691
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:01,829
Pretty sure I am,
dickwad.

692
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:03,264
I've known a lot of bullies--

693
00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:04,632
people who didn't like me
because I'm short,

694
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:05,433
people who didn't like me
because I'm Jewish--

695
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:06,667
Yeah, I get it.

696
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,336
There's a long list of reasons
not to like you.

697
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:11,773
You relentlessly mock, but it's
not for self-aggrandizement.

698
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,226
It's because ideas
are bigger than feelings.

699
00:36:17,196 --> 00:36:18,613
<i>At least that's what</i>
<i>I choose to believe.</i>

700
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,951
I also thought you had the side
effect of desensitizing me.

701
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,959
You little Hebe.

702
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:35,046
Here's some ideas for you.
You screwed up.

703
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:37,665
You kept on screwing up.
Everything you said is true,

704
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:41,669
except...

705
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,639
It doesn't mean
you walk away.

706
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:47,559
You just learn
to trust nothing.

707
00:36:47,643 --> 00:36:50,228
<i>Everything you think</i>
<i>you feel,</i>

708
00:36:50,312 --> 00:36:53,648
everything you think
you know.

709
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:54,983
Question every call,

710
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,735
<i>play through</i>
<i>every whistle.</i>

711
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:04,725
I just had
a light bulb.

712
00:37:04,777 --> 00:37:06,727
Maybe.

713
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:08,413
You can trust light bulbs.

714
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,375
Stop.

715
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:23,044
It's not Prions.

716
00:37:23,095 --> 00:37:24,245
Epstein-Barr
gave him mono.

717
00:37:24,296 --> 00:37:26,347
It also gave him
Miller Fisher syndrome.

718
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:28,683
The plasmapheresis played
through the whistle.

719
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:31,085
<i>We gave it</i>
<i>to him for MPA,</i>

720
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:32,437
but when he got worse,
we took him off.

721
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:35,089
When he got better,
we thought it was the antitoxin.

722
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:37,859
But it was actually the
plasmapheresis still working.

723
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:41,696
We had the right treatment,
just the wrong diagnosis.

724
00:37:41,764 --> 00:37:44,866
It was my metaphor
that solved the case.

725
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:48,236
<i>Put him back on plasmapheresis.</i>
<i>He'll be fine.</i>

726
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:50,905
Nice save.

727
00:37:50,956 --> 00:37:53,208
Didn't quite make up for being
a sieve the rest of the game.

728
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:05,286
Ex-girlfriend's
baby again?

729
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:10,225
<i>His mother is moving</i>
<i>to Costa Rica.</i>

730
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:12,343
He asked if he could
move in with me.

731
00:38:12,428 --> 00:38:16,231
And I said yes.

732
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,491
Well, it's only six
or seven years.

733
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:29,327
<i>Unless he can't get into</i>
<i>college, in which case,</i>

734
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:30,811
it's more a matter of
your life expectancy.

735
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:32,380
<i>I said yes,</i>

736
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,415
knowing I'm not remotely
ready for that,

737
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:37,919
knowing he's not ready to be
separated from his mother.

738
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:40,655
This isn't the act of
a mature, rational adult.

739
00:38:40,706 --> 00:38:43,591
<i>I--</i>

740
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:46,844
I can't do this, House.

741
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:49,714
<i>You were right.</i>

742
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:54,602
I have an idea...

743
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,688
that can make
this entire problem go away.

744
00:38:56,772 --> 00:38:58,389
Yes, I really
want to hear

745
00:38:58,474 --> 00:39:00,241
<i>your clever late-term</i>
<i>abortion joke.</i>

746
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:02,026
You were right
about everything.

747
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:03,528
This is life.
It's real.

748
00:39:03,612 --> 00:39:07,815
It doesn't just go away.

749
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,656
None of that is true.

750
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:18,660
Hey.

751
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:21,028
Duncan.

752
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,133
Actually...
Wendel.

753
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,636
One "l."

754
00:39:28,704 --> 00:39:29,837
<i>If you're going</i>
<i>to get pissy,</i>

755
00:39:29,888 --> 00:39:34,475
remember,
it was House's idea.

756
00:39:37,896 --> 00:39:39,314
You're an actor?

757
00:39:39,381 --> 00:39:43,234
Five commercials and a recurring
on <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

758
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:51,159
You were regretting not having
kids, so I gave you one...

759
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:54,228
Thereby rendering you
regret-free.

760
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,830
It's a priceless gift.

761
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:57,282
Get out.
<i>Well, it's not priceless</i>

762
00:39:57,366 --> 00:39:59,066
'cause he charges
SAG minimum.

763
00:39:59,118 --> 00:40:00,835
Get out!

764
00:40:03,505 --> 00:40:05,757
Chillax, Dad.

765
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:08,075
Can you do
an Australian accent?

766
00:40:33,652 --> 00:40:37,121
I just got the call.

767
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:40,908
Three-year deal.
$2.1 million.

768
00:40:49,084 --> 00:40:53,971
What about the flooded backyard
and pretending to be Lemieux?

769
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:56,758
That's why I took it.

770
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:59,627
After all I did
to get here,

771
00:40:59,678 --> 00:41:02,513
half a dream is better
than nothing.

772
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:08,486
Maybe my new coach will see
what my juniors coach didn't.

773
00:41:11,473 --> 00:41:14,325
That'd be nice.

774
00:41:36,548 --> 00:41:38,800
I'm not sleeping
with you.

775
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:42,437
That's a shame.

776
00:41:47,393 --> 00:41:48,693
This is about Popo.

777
00:41:48,777 --> 00:41:53,781
She's not sleeping
with me either, right?

778
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:55,516
You were jealous of me.

779
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:58,419
My family.

780
00:42:05,327 --> 00:42:09,414
Maybe you've got too much,
and I've got too little.

781
00:42:17,256 --> 00:42:19,307
I might sleep with you
after all.
