00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,919
Quack quack.

355
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,322
<i>Quack quack quack.</i>

356
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,744
I'm an ass.

357
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,197
On the plus side,
I can now program my DVR

358
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,032
from my phone.

359
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,534
They are kind of boring.

360
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,819
All kids, not just yours.

361
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,204
Very helpful.

362
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:40,622
You need to log more hours.

363
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,458
Eventually, you'll pass boredom
and get to bonding.

364
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,927
Kind of like
Stockholm syndrome.

365
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,596
I heard the nurses talking.

366
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:48,997
<i>You called Social Services</i>
<i>for real.</i>

367
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,383
Because you shouldn't
be living on your own.

368
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,268
Right, better my mom should
use me as a punching bag.

369
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:55,937
If your mom abused you,

370
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,006
Social Services won't
let you go home with her.

371
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,892
Have I mentioned
I don't trust the system?

372
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,561
We don't know
if you're better yet.

373
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,178
You can't just take off.

374
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,032
Uh, can we help you?

375
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,183
<i>I'm Adele Brown from</i>
<i>Social Services, and this is--</i>

376
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,819
I'm Ellen Rogers.

377
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,621
Callie's mother.

378
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,039
You haven't been that
for two years.

379
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:15,624
I promise...

380
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:16,625
Things are different.

381
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,376
Mom...two sentences in,

382
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,161
and you're already
making promises.

383
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,580
Okay, maybe we need
to take a minute here

384
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,048
and give Callie
some space.

385
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,916
No, I don't need a minute.
I need her out of my life.

386
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,668
[Coughing]
Is she okay?

387
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,802
I will be once you just...

388
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,704
[Coughing]

389
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,672
Oh, my God!

390
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,225
<i>(Taub)</i>
<i>We need help in here!</i>

391
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,310
[Callie continuing
to cough]

392
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:38,763
[Suction slurping]

393
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:42,890
- Go!
- <i>(Man) And they're off!</i>

394
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,690
You bet 100 bucks
on a turtle race?

395
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:47,309
I paid Mr. Chips 5 bucks
to take a dive.

396
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,528
[Crowd cheering]

397
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:51,480
The bleeding
stopped on its own.

398
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,832
<i>She got worse after</i>
<i>being on steroids,</i>

399
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,867
so autoimmune is out.

400
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:55,868
Diagnosis depends
on whether the blood

401
00:16:55,952 --> 00:16:57,036
was coming
from the sinuses,

402
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,454
lungs, or her guts.

403
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,841
Mr. Chips
looks like he wants it.

404
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:05,160
100 bucks says he'll
make soup out of Franklin.

405
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:06,328
[Cheers and applause]

406
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,763
You're on.

407
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:10,516
How'd the mom
seem to you?

408
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,967
If you're asking him
if she looks like someone

409
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:13,168
who beat her kid,
you're a moron.

410
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,054
Move your ass, Mr. Chips!

411
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:36,642
You should have seen her face
when mom walked in.

412
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:38,617
Callie hates her.
I don't think she's lying.

413
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,036
Because people never lie
about people they hate.

414
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,788
<i>Big sinus bleed</i>
<i>could be sinusitis</i>

415
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:43,872
<i>and a bleeding disorder.</i>

416
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:45,323
She didn't complain
about a headache.

417
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,491
The bleeding
is in her gut.

418
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:47,692
<i>Could be</i>
<i>Zollinger-Ellison.</i>

419
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:50,328
<i>Acid reflux causes asthma,</i>

420
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,414
and the acid erodes the stomach,
causing the bleeding.

421
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:53,582
[Cheers and applause]

422
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,201
Yes!

423
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,552
Franklin rules.

424
00:17:57,637 --> 00:18:00,889
Mr. Chips drools.

425
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:03,225
<i>Mr. Chips's owner only feeds</i>
<i>him on apples and bananas.</i>

426
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:04,709
Nowhere near enough
vitamin A.

427
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:05,727
Pay up.

428
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:07,212
And do an upper endoscopy

429
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:09,231
to confirm
for Zollinger-Ellison,

430
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:11,349
after mommie dearest
has given her permission.

431
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,735
Ellen shouldn't have consent
if she beat her daughter.

432
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,553
Doesn't matter if
she beat her daughter.

433
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:20,025
Only matters if Social Services
says she beat her daughter.

434
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:23,128
Good thing you made it
all official.

435
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:27,532
Will the endoscopy
be painful?

436
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,867
Is that an issue?

437
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:32,387
It's a medical procedure.

438
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:34,456
There will be
some discomfort.

439
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:36,158
I never meant
to hurt my daughter.

440
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:39,928
And yet you hit her.

441
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,279
She told you that?

442
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:43,548
And now you're gonna
tell me you didn't.

443
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:47,636
I'm a drug addict.

444
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,438
And I've been
a lousy mom.

445
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:54,192
Especially since
my husband died.

446
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,095
I mean, he was closer
to Callie than I was,

447
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,730
and I missed him...

448
00:18:58,781 --> 00:18:59,981
So much.

449
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,701
And it was too hard.

450
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,936
And taking Oxy just...

451
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:07,739
made things easier.

452
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,742
Right up until it made me
lose my daughter.

453
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:15,714
I hurt Callie a lot.

454
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,084
But one of the only things
that I can feel okay about

455
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:21,620
is that I never hit her.

456
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,366
Didn't peg you as
the midday fun kind of guy.

457
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:36,501
So glad I was wrong.

458
00:19:38,938 --> 00:19:41,239
Ohh. Unfortunately,

459
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,675
that's not why we're here.

460
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:49,114
Remember that guy from
the restaurant yesterday?

461
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,983
Mm-hmm.

462
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,651
He's got pictures
of us.

463
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:55,486
He's threatening
to show your husband.

464
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:58,256
I thought you said that guy
was one of your best doctors.

465
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:00,192
Yeah, not one
of my best people.

466
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:05,213
We've gotta stop
seeing each other.

467
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:07,182
Not necessarily.

468
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,367
I told my husband
about you.

469
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:12,053
What?

470
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,939
Why?

471
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,507
He was saying that things
had been better lately

472
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,177
between him and I,
that I was happier.

473
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,363
I said that I was.

474
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:24,015
And that you
were the reason.

475
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,785
And...He was okay
with that?

476
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,019
Not initially.

477
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,955
It was a pretty tough
conversation.

478
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,690
Neither of us is ready
to give up on the marriage.

479
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:35,493
And I am not ready
to give up this.

480
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:41,466
You don't have to feel
so guilty anymore.

481
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:55,380
[Inhales through teeth,
groans]

482
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:57,482
You didn't need
to shoot yourself.

483
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,550
I could have given you
a Section 8.

484
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:02,737
We've hit the drills
pretty hard,

485
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:04,222
and by the fourth round,
my hand went numb.

486
00:21:04,273 --> 00:21:05,774
The gun slipped and--

487
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:07,392
I only had blanks in it,
but...

488
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,394
It's funny how nearly
shooting your toe off

489
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:11,229
cured that
speech impediment.

490
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,114
Ah. Yeah.
Sorry about that.

491
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,784
Sheldon's a...Progressive.

492
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:17,669
Eh--compared to who?

493
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,087
Rupert Murdoch?

494
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:20,538
Progressives are reenactors

495
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,123
who strive for
complete authenticity.

496
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,709
They never drop character
while in uniform.

497
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,178
Whereas you just
dabble in crazy.

498
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,648
[Sighs]

499
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:30,715
<i>Sheldon and I had</i>
<i>a big falling out</i>

500
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:32,050
<i>years ago.</i>

501
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,351
<i>We only really started</i>

502
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,604
talking again because
of the reenactments.

503
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:37,155
They, uh...

504
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:39,140
Gave me my brother back.

505
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:41,259
<i>That's a very moving story.</i>

506
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,694
Be a lot more affecting
if you hadn't

507
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:46,114
bonded over something
so completely idiotic.

508
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:48,149
[Hisses]

509
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:53,121
Your mom didn't
hit you, did she?

510
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:57,108
No.

511
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,609
Then why'd
you lie about it?

512
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:03,715
Because I wanted
to get out of here.

513
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,166
People understand
getting hit

514
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:07,752
more than
what my mom does.

515
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,905
Tell me.
Maybe I'll understand.

516
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,895
Well, I was the mom.

517
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:19,731
She couldn't keep a job.

518
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,266
She'd spend
all her money on pills.

519
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:22,901
I had to get a job.

520
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,487
Double shifts,
just to keep the power on.

521
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:27,972
Keep food in the house.

522
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:30,675
I couldn't tell you how many
times she nearly O.D.ed

523
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:33,645
<i>and I had to clean her up</i>
<i>and put her in bed.</i>

524
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:38,817
So I decided, if I was
gonna be the grown-up,

525
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:40,669
I'd rather do it
on my own terms.

526
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,829
Your mom knows
she messed up.

527
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:54,215
She's determined
not to do it again.

528
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,067
Yeah.

529
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:57,435
And she'll feel that way,

530
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:59,120
right up until
things get too tough

531
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:00,772
and she has to start
using again.

532
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:11,733
Do you think
people can change?

533
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,868
No.

534
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:16,037
But I don't think that's
gonna change your opinion,

535
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:18,907
because...
people don't change.

536
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:23,962
Stop.

537
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,097
<i>Is that an ulcer?</i>
Yeah, it is.

538
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:27,532
But we haven't
reached the stomach yet.

539
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,401
I'm still high
in the esophagus.

540
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:31,002
Means it's not
Zollinger-Ellison.

541
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,339
<i>Ulcer's bleeding.</i>

542
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,642
We need to lavage before
she drowns in her own blood.

543
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,344
[Coughing]

544
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:43,186
(Chase) Cauterized the ulcer,
stopped the bleeding.

545
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:45,064
(Taub) Compromised immune system
from living on the street

546
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,663
<i>could have made her</i>
<i>susceptible to HPV.</i>

547
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:48,326
HPV was covered
on the STD panel.

548
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,254
<i>She's negative.</i>

549
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:51,222
What if she didn't
get this from being homeless?

550
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:52,757
What if she got it
from her mom?

551
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,959
I'm assuming you're thinking
something genetic, because--

552
00:23:55,043 --> 00:23:56,394
I'm thinking addiction.

553
00:23:56,462 --> 00:23:58,796
Alcohol-induced
esophagitis.

554
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,748
Explains esophageal ulcers
and her other symptoms.

555
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,350
If only
it would explain

556
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,751
why we've never
seen her drunk,

557
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:05,085
drinking, or detoxing.

558
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:06,771
Her blood pressure's
been elevated.

559
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:07,755
Could be the DTs.

560
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:09,106
It's been mildly elevated.

561
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:10,591
Mildly elevated BP

562
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:13,110
could put her at risk
of a Berry aneurysm.

563
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:15,029
Weak blood vessel
in the brain

564
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:16,981
gets pounded on
by elevated BP,

565
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:19,901
causes it to expand
and contract.

566
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,003
<i>Causes the symptoms</i>
<i>to come and go.</i>

567
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,071
CT didn't show any signs
of an aneurysm.

568
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:26,123
Did I mention
they come and go?

569
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,909
Much as your presence
may cause

570
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,794
objects to become
engorged with blood,

571
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:32,463
sometimes aneurysms
just aren't in the mood.

572
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:33,381
Alcoholism
and Berry aneurysm

573
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:34,966
are both valid theories.

574
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,467
I think we should discuss this
with the patient and her mom.

575
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:37,969
Why? We discussed it
right here.

576
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,637
Go tell 'em she needs
a cerebral angiogram

577
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:40,972
to locate the aneurysm,

578
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:43,591
then surgery to repair.

579
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:46,761
(Callie)
Brain surgery?

580
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:48,596
When?

581
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:50,915
We booked the O.R.
for an hour from now.

582
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:54,902
And Dr. House is sure
that's what she has?

583
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,303
He's confident
in the diagnosis.

584
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:58,305
It's consistent with
all of her symptoms.

585
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,610
But you don't buy it.

586
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:04,144
No.

587
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:06,814
I think your symptoms
are the result

588
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:09,316
of alcohol abuse.

589
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:11,619
But I'm not--
I'm not an alcoholic.

590
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,487
You came to the hospital
with beer in your pocket.

591
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:15,122
We found more alcohol
at your house.

592
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:16,541
Yeah, I use booze
as payment.

593
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,609
I have an occasional beer
with my friends.

594
00:25:18,677 --> 00:25:20,828
That doesn't mean
I have a problem.

595
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,800
I want the surgery.

596
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:28,536
Actually,
it's your mom's decision.

597
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,711
I'm not an addict.

598
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:38,946
That's what I always
said to you, Callie,

599
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,682
but I had a problem--
I'm nothing like you!

600
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,239
Tell them to do the surgery.

601
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,296
I need a few minutes
to think.

602
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,903
The patient asked me
what I thought.

603
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:05,306
I pay you to think
inside this room.

604
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,941
Outside this room,
I pay you to parrot.

605
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:08,943
It's her choice.
She has the right to know!

606
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,578
<i>It's a medical choice</i>

607
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:11,579
that you turned
into an extension

608
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:13,364
of your baggage and hers.

609
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,333
You told the mom something
you want to believe

610
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:16,617
because you
don't want to believe

611
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:18,502
that this girl might be
doing fine parent-free.

612
00:26:18,587 --> 00:26:20,121
Which also happens to be
what the mom wants to believe.

613
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:21,589
You think she wants
to feel responsible

614
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:23,124
for her daughter's illness?

615
00:26:23,175 --> 00:26:25,159
That woman sees everything to do
with her daughter through...

616
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,261
Guilt-colored glasses.

617
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:28,996
It's all her fault.

618
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,556
House...

619
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,775
Don't...bully her.

620
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:43,444
She's overwhelmed enough.

621
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:44,612
Well, it's nothing compared
to how she's gonna feel

622
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,314
when her daughter dies
from the aneurysm

623
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:47,815
she decided not to treat.

624
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:10,137
You must be Dr. House.

625
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:11,839
I save my appearances

626
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,841
for when parents are on
the brink of doing something

627
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:16,477
incredibly stupid.

628
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:19,847
Your daughter has
a Berry aneurysm.

629
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:21,816
She needs surgery.

630
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:23,901
What she does not need
is you making this

631
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:27,104
or any other decision.

632
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,906
Well, I can't just

633
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,191
leave this up to her.

634
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:31,359
Then leave it up to me,

635
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,861
and just leave.

636
00:27:33,912 --> 00:27:35,396
Ohh.

637
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,449
I'm not gonna
abandon my daughter.

638
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,801
She hates you.

639
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:46,374
It's actually not
such a big deal.

640
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:48,175
There's plenty of kids
who hate their parents.

641
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:53,214
What makes it a big deal
is that she should hate you.

642
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:56,133
Playing the biology card
doesn't change anything

643
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,635
except where she lives.

644
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,304
Your daughter is better off
without you.

645
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:03,774
So...let her be
better off without you.

646
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:11,265
I'm gonna
do the surgery.

647
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,784
I'll take the fallout
from Social Services.

<i>Dr. House!</i>

649
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:46,467
My daughter's care
is my choice.

650
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,769
And so is this.

651
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,938
Treat her
for alcoholism.

Probably just
got sick of lying.

<i>Look at it this way.</i>

657
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:07,705
Now the sex is both
commitment- and guilt-free.

658
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,624
And men love
commitment-free sex.

659
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:12,510

Yes, they do.

660

How do you keep doing
the same thing over and over

666

with the same level
of enthusiasm?

667
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:28,025
First off, be a decent,
empathetic person.

<i>This is what you</i>
<i>said you wanted,</i>

669

but you're
actually more upset

670
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,730
now that
her husband knows.

671
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,648
- 'Cause I'm hurting him.
- You always were.

672
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:35,783
Yeah, but he didn't
know that.

673
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,735
Which means
he wasn't really hurt.

674
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,904
Yeah, I know
it's a rationalization,

675

A little less guilty
about seeing her.

she'd steal it.

She gave it back.

You could at least
let her sleep in the room.

She could have listened to me
about my drinking.

right about it,

00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:09,629
see if you could
get her back on drugs

708
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,797
and out of her
daughter's life.

709
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,999
That was to show Adams
that mommie dearest

710
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,301
hadn't changed.

711
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:17,437
I'm taking a principled stand
against idealism.

712

Your patient's stable?

713
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:22,175
Well, maybe Adams
was right.

714
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:23,944
The illness
is alcohol-related.

715
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:25,278
Well, I hope so,

716
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:27,063
considering it's what
we're treating her for.

717
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:29,699
You--you hope
you're wrong

718
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:32,369

of the patient?

719
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:34,020
I hope that I'm right

720
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:37,357
but the aneurism bursts
without killing her.

721
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:38,792
Call me a softie.

722
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:43,079
Or the mom agrees
to an autopsy

723
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:44,414
so I can prove it.

724
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:52,989
Your patients love you
because you're empathetic.

725
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,077
I also have kind eyes.

726
00:31:57,144 --> 00:31:58,511
Why are you here?

727
00:31:58,563 --> 00:32:00,213
But you don't love
all your patients?

728
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:03,233
Of course not.

729
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:05,885
I'll--I'll bet

Why are you here?

732
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,991
But you...fake
an interest in them

733
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,659
because you needed to,
right?

734
00:32:12,726 --> 00:32:13,743
And if you do it
long enough,

735
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:14,995
it becomes real?

736
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:16,580
Well, no,

737
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:19,499
because the interest
isn't fake.

738
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:21,434
Really?

739
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:24,704
Because you realize
they're not dull.

740
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:26,790
It was just your
misinterpretation of them.

741
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:30,410
I just haven't found a way
to make them interesting yet.

742

common ground.

746
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:43,306
Sometimes, the best way
to connect with someone

747
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:45,892
is stop thinking about them
and focus on yourself.

on her way into a soup kitchen.

But once they hatched,

874
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:07,588
the worms got to work
on her lungs,

875

her ear,
the nerves in her legs.

876
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:11,959
The worms got agitated
by the steroids we gave her,

877
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,512
which started them on their
journey to the esophagus

878

and, ultimately,
to the heart.
