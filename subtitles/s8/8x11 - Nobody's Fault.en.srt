179
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,898
What explosion?

180
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,933
A chemistry demonstration
he was doing

181
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:36,368
for his class
went wrong.

182
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,003
Why was it not already
in the patient history?

183
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:41,206
Because the patient
was unconscious.

184
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:43,809
But I'm assuming
Dr. House spoke to the wife.

185
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:45,377
The wife didn't know
about the explosion.

186
00:08:45,428 --> 00:08:47,412
And I was the one
who questioned her,

187
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:48,630
so, if there was
an oversight,

188
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:52,417
it was mine.

189
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:55,604
Does Dr. House not attach
importance to patient histories?

190
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:57,189
No, he thinks
they're crucial.

191
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:59,224
He just doesn't think
being in the same room

192
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,943
as the patient is crucial.

193
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:04,863
House thinks avoiding
patients

194
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,934
allows him to stay
as objective as possible.

195
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:12,237
He's not wrong.

196
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:15,324
Sounds like a very diplomatic
way of saying he's lazy.

197
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,209
That's also true.

198
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:18,927
Either way, I'm covered.

199
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:20,796
If you want
an accurate patient history,

200
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:22,047
don't ever talk
to the patient.

201
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,499
Everybody lies.

202
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,668
Except me.

203
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:27,952
To you.

204
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:30,055
Would never do that.

205
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:31,840
Okay.
Say you're right.

206
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:35,060
If you had actually been
in the room,

207
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:36,461
questioning the patient,

208
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,063
you could read body language,

209
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,098
you could ask
follow-up questions,

210
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,935
warn him of the costs
of lying to you.

211
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:45,821
Don't forget the thumbscrews.

212
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,441
Can you dispute
the possibility that,

213
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,193
had you visited
the patient sooner,

214
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,728
maybe talked to the wife,

215
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:54,546
been directed
to one of the students,

216
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:57,416
that this case might have ended
very differently?

217
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:02,671
(Bill)
It wasn't exactly an explosion.

218
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:04,539
It was a controlled reaction

219
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:07,008
that went a little haywire.

220
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:08,827
It was too an explosion.

221
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:11,296
Simon Harris filmed the whole
thing on his camera phone

222
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:13,382
and posted it on YouTube.

223
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:15,600
It got, like, over 75,000 hits
already.

224
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:17,602
Looks like
you've gone viral, Hon.

225
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,806
[Coughs]

226
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:23,842
(House)
He had a loss of consciousness,

227
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:26,645
temporary paralysis...

228
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:29,648
But when I was told
the patient coughed up blood,

229
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,451
then things really started
to get interesting.

230
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:39,124
Your patient was doubled over
in pain and coughing up blood,

231
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:40,892
and you found that interesting?

232
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,861
Why, is that bad?

233
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,582
It's interesting.

234
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:55,620
I do this demonstration
every year.

235
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:58,008
<i>I usually have a student aide</i>
<i>help me set it up,</i>

236
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:01,428
<i>and apparently this year he</i>
<i>added extra hydrofluoric acid,</i>

237
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,964
which is why it exploded.

238
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:05,899
The student aide was just trying
to make a viral video,

239
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,251
not hurt anyone.

240
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,770
Ended up doing both.

241
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:12,222
So we figured the patient
inhaled the extra large dose

242
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,774
of hydrofluoric acid and...

243
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,025
Burned his lungs,

244
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,310
which is why
he coughed up blood.

245
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:17,561
If only burnt lungs explained

246
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:19,313
the passing out and paralysis.

247
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:21,348
The explosion does.
Check out the video again.

248
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,733
He smacked his head
against the wall.

249
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:25,185
If that caused swelling
in his brainstem,

250
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:26,987
that would have led
to eventual loss

251
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:28,689
of consciousness
and paralysis.

252
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,625
So we discussed it
a little longer,

253
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:35,662
and House decided
to treat with Heparin.

254
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:41,335
I wouldn't mind
a couple more details.

255
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:43,871
It was aerosolized Heparin.

256
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:46,640
You skipped
over the actual DDX,

257
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,276
and now you're averting
your eyes.

258
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:51,545
I'm growing more
and more curious by the moment.

259
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:57,717
He smacked his head
against the wall.

260
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,020
If that caused swelling
in his brainstem,

261
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:01,655
that would have led
to eventual loss

262
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,824
of consciousness
and paralysis.

263
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:04,891
- <i>[Muffled] Nobody move.</i>
- Aagh!

264
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:07,494
He--he had on a what?

265
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,229
Gas mask.

266
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,903
The stink bomb
was Chase's.

267
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:19,906
He was getting revenge
for the orange hair

268
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,542
and rigged it
in House's office.

269
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:26,813
But House found it.

270
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,448
Mm-hmm.

271
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,552
You can leave
when I have an answer.

272
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:34,271
It might help
if we knew the question.

273
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:35,472
How do we treat

274
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:38,591
chemical burns
inside the lungs?

275
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:41,228
Maybe we can use
a bronchoalveolar lavage

276
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,446
<i>to wash 'em out</i>
<i>with water.</i>

277
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,481
Sorry. My fault.
Should have clarified.

278
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,533
How do we treat chemical burns

279
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,318
inside the lungs
without killing the patient?

280
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:51,771
Silver sulfadiazine
works well on chemical burns.

281
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:53,790
Burn cream would drown him
faster than water.

282
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,877
Well?

283
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,712
Aerosolized Heparin.

284
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,282
Me likey.

285
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,917
<i>(Park)</i>
<i>But that's only experimental.</i>

286
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,100
It's never actually
been used before.

287
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,169
Not true.

288
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,554
Been used in sheep.

289
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:10,157
Uh-huh.

290
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:14,794
The guy was going downhill
fast.

291
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:16,963
We needed a treatment
that was a...

292
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:18,365
Slope changer.

293
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,200
So you busted out
the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?

294
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:22,352
It was a team-building exercise.

295
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:24,304
No. It was manipulation.

296
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:26,239
You were pressuring your team
into coming up

297
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,608
with unsafe medical ideas
just to get out of that room.

298
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,613
You say pressure,
I say inspire.

299
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:35,832
The usual safe ideas
were not gonna work.

300
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,367
Aerosolized Heparin might.

301
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,052
And everyone else
just went along with this?

302
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,654
No.

303
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:44,491
I told House I thought
it was a mistake.

304
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,026
And those were
your exact words?

305
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:49,629
I think
I might have said insane.

306
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,932
You thought it was insane,
and yet you let it happen.

307
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,500
No, I--
if you disagree

308
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:54,667
with Dr. House
on patient safety, Doctor,

309
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,553
it is your duty
to speak up.

310
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,055
Otherwise, you are equally
to blame.

311
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,206
I did speak up.
I tried.

312
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:02,192
And you failed.

313
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:05,278
And that's why
I went to Dr. Foreman.

314
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:11,101
The Heparin could cause
the patient to bleed

315
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:13,019
into his lungs even faster.

316
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:14,504
It is crazy,

317
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:17,040
but House doesn't do crazy
just for crazy's sake.

318
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,577
If he thinks this is the only
way to help your patient...

319
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,250
<i>(Cofield) You did not tell me</i>
<i>you were involved in this case</i>

320
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:29,503
when you
asked me to do this.

321
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:31,505
I wasn't.

322
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:32,956
The Heparin decision

323
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,976
didn't have anything to do
with the outcome.

324
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:38,929
If signing off on everything
House does is a pattern,

325
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:40,931
it affects
the way House behaves,

326
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,049
it affects the way
House's team reacts

327
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:44,434
to the way House behaves.

328
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,554
House...

329
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:49,589
is brilliant.

330
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:52,325
I give him the benefit
of the doubt most of the time

331
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,244
because I've seen
what he can do.

332
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,662
Getting House out of prison

333
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,581
is the biggest decision
you've made as Dean of Medicine,

334
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,399
right?

335
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,169
And if he's suspended
as a result of this hearing,

336
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,756
he violates his parole
and he goes back.

337
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,010
And that probably leaves you
as former Dean of Medicine.

338
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:14,181
I suppose so.

339
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,316
You didn't choose me
to oversee this

340
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:18,151
because you thought
I could be objective.

341
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:21,221
You chose me because
you thought I'd have your back

342
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,356
and I'd think twice
about making a decision

343
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,443
that would get you fired.

344
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:30,263
Eric.

345
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:31,765
I'm sorry.

346
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,568
But if your
get-House-out-of-jail-free

347
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:37,671
experiment
blows up in your face,

348
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:41,441
it's not my job
to get you out of it.

349
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:49,222
After you'd administered
the Heparin,

350
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:50,675
I see there was a discharge
order on the chart,

351
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:52,810
and yet the patient
never left.

352
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:55,430
House ordered
a therapeutic bath first

353
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:58,766
to wash off any residual
chemicals from the blast.

354
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:00,651
But we wound up
finding something.

355
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,403
You have a bit of a rash.

356
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:04,272
Can you raise
both your arms?

357
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:07,158
I just need to see
how far it goes.

358
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:11,496
<i>(Bill) You told me</i>
<i>i was going to be okay.</i>

359
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:14,582
And now there's
still something wrong with me.

360
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,667
It probably doesn't mean
anything,

361
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:19,253
but we want to
make sure.

362
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:21,255
Of course you do.

363
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,240
I got to get out of here,
okay?

364
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,625
Just relax.

365
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,294
Please just let me
get out of here.

366
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:27,512
It'll just take a minute.

367
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,647
We just need to get
a good look at the rash.

368
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:31,048
The rash?
That was nothing.

369
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,269
Just some irritation
from lying in bed all day.

370
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:37,438
The problem
was the patient's brain.

371
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:39,107
He freaked out.

372
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,925
I got to--I got to get out.

373
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:42,560
I got to get out of here.

374
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:44,612
"Freak out" is a little strong.

375
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,614
In my opinion at the time,

376
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:49,117
it was the rash
that was gonna kill him.

377
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,568
Invasive strep.

378
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:52,370
Reasonable theory,
supported by the evidence.

379
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:54,906
The evidence pointed
to psychosis.

380
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:56,824
We caused it
by giving him steroids

381
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,159
when he first came in.

382
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,944
What'd you think?

383
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:02,296
I thought Park and Adams
were both right

384
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:04,615
but that their conclusions
were both wrong.

385
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,335
The neuro symptoms
and the rash were both signs

386
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:08,786
of an underlying disease.

387
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:14,425
Together with the lung,
it added up to Wegener's.

388
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:18,930
How does Dr. House handle it
when three smart doctors

389
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:21,682
come up with three different
but equally valid ideas?

390
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,018
I run a diagnostic trial.

391
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:31,659
Start the patient
on high-dose steroids.

392
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:34,745
<i>Multiple birds,</i>
<i>single stone.</i>

393
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:38,199
<i>If Taub is right, then he</i>
<i>will walk out of here cured.</i>

394
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:40,001
<i>If Adams is right,</i>
<i>he'll spike a fever,</i>

395
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:41,452
get hypotensive,
we can treat it.

396
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:43,204
He can walk out of here cured.

397
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:44,872
If Park is right,

398
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:46,374
he goes all <i>Cuckoo's Nest</i>
on us,

399
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,626
we can cross "brain"
off the list,

400
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,661
diagnose him, and he can walk
out of here cured.

401
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:52,380
Are you trying
to make this easy for me?

402
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:53,798
By your own admission,

403
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,333
if you give
the patient steroids,

404
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,635
two of the three outcomes
are gonna make him worse.

405
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:58,519
What was making
the patient worse

406
00:17:58,604 --> 00:18:00,304
was not having a diagnosis.

407
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,139
This was the fastest way
to get it.

408
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,442
It was a perfect
diagnostic moment.

409
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:06,978
In light of what happened,

410
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:10,314
you still think it was
the perfect diagnostic moment?

411
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:15,069
Yes.

412
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:18,789
My theory accounted
for all the medical outcomes.

413
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:25,563
It did not account for
the disobedience of my own team.

414
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:31,368
What are you doing?

415
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,203
I think you're right
about the strep.

416
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:35,706
Can't hurt to biopsy the rash
while we're waiting.

417
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,642
Thanks.

418
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:45,066
At the time, it seemed
like a good idea.

419
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,718
I know this is hard,

420
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:52,256
but please tell me exactly
what happened next.

421
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:58,663
Draw up a little anesthetic.

422
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,583
Two ccs Lidocaine.

423
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:08,673
Get away from me.

Code Grey!

428
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:27,058
So your position
is that your team's disobedience

429
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,026
caused this?
That's not what I said.

430
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:30,795
You said you didn't anticipate
their defiance.

431
00:19:30,862 --> 00:19:33,497
You implied that all
would have been fine otherwise.

432
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:35,199
So who do you blame,

433
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,702
Dr. Adams
or Dr. Chase?

434
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:39,203
Or both?

435
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:43,908
I don't blame either one.

436
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:47,295
So who do you blame,
Dr. House?

Oh, my God,

Prep the O.R.

444

Start an I.V.

Come on.
The bleeder's got to be in here.

446
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:52,957
Got it.
Which artery?

447
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:54,792
It's his heart.

448
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:01,065
Fortunately, only the knife tip
reached the cardiac muscle.

449
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,601
Made a laceration
in the left ventricle

450
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:05,736
about the size of the tip
of my index finger.

At that moment,
he could only stay alive

452

as long as my finger
plugged the hole.

453
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:14,312
It could have been me
on the floor.

454
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:16,180
It should have been me.

455
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:17,548
It was my theory.

456
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,100
I held the needle
in front of the patient

457
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:22,236
that set off his paranoia.

458

My diagnostic test worked.

467

It proved the patient
had a steroid-induced psychosis.

468

And that's what you took away
from this situation?

469
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:52,967
The brain was not a symptom
of an underlying disease.

There really was nothing
for him to do.

501
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,492

callousness

don't you think?

Who cares
if House was callous?

504
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:13,664
Are you gonna punish
callousness?

505
00:23:13,732 --> 00:23:16,600

is a useful quality for doctors?

that Chase was at fault.

in there.

Well, it's not like I can

It was a prank.

It wasn't uncommon.

why that matters?

that my judgment
was compromised?

Who do you think was at fault

569
00:27:27,164 --> 00:27:28,998
for what happened to you,
Dr. Chase?

570
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:31,734

<i>You're a smart doctor.</i>

572
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:35,204
You know what happened here
better than anyone,

with Dr. House

574

575
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:41,944

to answer that very question.

577
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:51,270
I don't think
it was anyone's fault.

578
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,805
I was angry,

579
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:55,508
but I wasn't distracted.

580
00:27:55,576 --> 00:27:57,810
And I think that,
if there's any chance

581
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:59,345
I'm gonna walk again,

582
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:02,481
it's because
Dr. House is a genius.

00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:03,583
How about warmth?

591
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:26,355
That'd mean the damage

No.

<i>not necessarily.</i>

And if it's not a clot?

604
00:28:48,045 --> 00:28:50,046
Then you can ask Foreman

Dr. House's
complete lack of concern

636

Now that happened

that that's okay in his world,

661
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:54,980

<i>that you may never walk again</i>

666
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:07,443

Your husband has a tumor
in his lymph nodes.

712
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:00,734
You've been wrong
every time.

713

Yeah, well,
not this time.

The explosion

caused the cancer cells
to break open.

716
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:07,558
It's called
tumor lysis syndrome.

His body's flooded

all kinds of cancerous junk.

719
00:35:13,115 --> 00:35:15,249
It explains the paralysis,
the bleeding,

00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,568
the heart and kidney issues,
everything.

721
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:22,239
What about
the psychotic break?

722
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,044
Turns out we caused that.

This is treatable.
Okay?

725
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,585
You have to tell
the new doctors

726
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:36,187
that he needs
total body radiation

727
00:35:36,254 --> 00:35:37,521

729
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:54,538
Where's Cofield?

730
00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:56,207
He said you walked out.

731
00:35:56,274 --> 00:35:58,626
Well, I'm walking back.
I'm not done testifying.

732
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,943
Apparently you were.

733
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:02,796

tomorrow.

Dr. House

Well, I think

739
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:08,756
But Dr. House
is also a fiasco.

to all the other doctors

that it's okay
to act that way and--

746
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:22,753
Sorry.

747
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:23,971

And when they told me
he was in here,

751

I should say something.

They found the tumor.

757
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:48,962
They are removing it, and they
are starting plasmapheresis.

759

As I was saying,
Dr. House's process

to change that process.

that her husband's gonna live

And since there's no way
that you're doing her

794

without me knowing, it means
you were just doing her shampoo.

795
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:35,779
Which means you were out late
drinking with some new girl

there is no new girl.
