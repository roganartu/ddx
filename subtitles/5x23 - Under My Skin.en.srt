1
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,406
- It's way too fast.
- It felt good.

2
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:30,475
- If we could clear
the stage quickly, please.

3
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:31,910
- Maury, it's too fast.

4
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:34,279
- It's exactly the same.
- Then slow it down.

5
00:00:34,347 --> 00:00:35,347
- Everything
all right, Jeremy?

6
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:38,049
- Sure.
Ready whenever you are.

7
00:00:38,117 --> 00:00:39,951
- From the allegro, please.

8
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:47,392
- What's his problem?

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,027
- His back's not 100%.

10
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:50,762
- He can't talk
to the conductor like that.

11
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,763
- No, he can't.

12
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:54,599
She could.

13
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:01,740
- You okay with the lift?

14
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:03,007
- I'll be fine unless
you mess up the timing.

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,717
- My timing is perfect.

16
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:13,818
- It was last night.

17
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:19,491
- Moment of truth.

18
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:41,713
- Aah.

19
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:43,214
- Damn it.

20
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:48,153
- Penelope, are you all right?

21
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:58,296
- She--she can't breathe!

22
00:01:58,364 --> 00:01:59,230
Call a doctor!

23
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,713
- Are you gonna ignore me
all day again?

24
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,248
I help you.

25
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:52,050
- You tried to kill Chase.

26
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:53,718
- Doing what you wanted,
that's all, boss.

27
00:02:58,257 --> 00:02:59,858
- I exist.
- No, you don't.

28
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:03,228
I acknowledge
my subconscious exists.

29
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,729
Now go away.

30
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:06,865
Saying it is one thing.

31
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,800
Living it is another.

32
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,805
You're not rational...

33
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:15,373
not completely.

34
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:21,112
- Put the phone
on the receiver,

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,814
send the hookers home,
and get dressed.

36
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:24,315
We've got a case.
- I'm taking a personal day.

37
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:25,550
- 21-year-old star

38
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:27,252
at the New York Ballet
collapsed on stage.

39
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,620
- I love ballet.

40
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:30,055
But as someone
may have mentioned,

41
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,423
I'm taking a personal day.

42
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,825
- Cuddy said get your ass in
or you're fired.

43
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:35,860
- She's not gonna fire me.

44
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,595
- She's not gonna fire you...

45
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:39,831
if you don't go to work?
- Okay.

46
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:42,801
- How long do you figure
till I just disappear?

47
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:47,772
- Hold on.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,141
- No tumors or punctures
in the lungs,

49
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,445
no bruising,
no sign of trauma, no STDs.

50
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:55,080
- And supplemental oxygen's
only gotten

51
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:57,649
her saturation level to 60.

52
00:03:57,717 --> 00:03:58,516
Lungs keep collapsing
despite a chest tube.

53
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,185
- E.R. ruled out the obvious.

54
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,853
White count and temp
were normal, so no pneumonia.

55
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:03,254
- Coffee's burnt.

56
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:04,689
Thirteen's wearing
cherry-flavored lip gloss.

57
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:06,024
Foreman's staring at you.

58
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:07,192
Any of that helpful?

59
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:09,894
- House?

60
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,396
- STD?

61
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,031
- We just said the tests were
negative. You think we should--

62
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,332
- No.

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,935
- She's a dancer.
What about dehydration?

64
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:19,304
- What about
a pulmonary contusion?

65
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:21,806
C.T. showed no inflammation
on the lungs.

66
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,608
- What about dehydration?

67
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:27,178
- B.U.N. and Creatinine

68
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:29,380
are elevated but within range.

69
00:04:29,448 --> 00:04:32,751
- Hey, I'm just the irrational
part of your brain,

70
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:34,486
but elevated means high, right?

71
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:36,988
Dehydration
could hide an infection.

72
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,392
- Dehydration
could hide an infection.

73
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,861
Go treat her
for the obvious--

74
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:46,464
I.V. fluids and antibiotics
for the pneumonia.

75
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:51,703
- We're like Magic and Kareem.

76
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:55,173
- Mr. Pietramala,

77
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,175
you have kidney cancer.
- Wow.

78
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:58,910
Is that a bad one?

79
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:00,044
I mean, they're all bad, but--

80
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,981
- The door was closed

81
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,182
for a reason.

82
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,683
- Well, now it's open
for a reason.

83
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,684
We need to talk.

84
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:08,019
- H-he just told me

85
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,521
I have kidney cancer.

86
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:11,823
- Then you'll obviously need
a moment to process.

87
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,757
- House.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,060
- I'm hallucinating.

89
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:20,365
- I'm...

90
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:21,933
I'll be right back.

91
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,541
- I need you to sit in
on my differentials,

92
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,975
double-check everything I do.

93
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:32,076
- You can't treat
patients if--

94
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:33,678
- It's got to be sleep apnea.

95
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:35,480
I get a good night's sleep,
and I still feel exhausted.

96
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:38,216
Lack of delta sleep
can lead to hallucinations.

97
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:40,885
- Do you have
any other neurological symptoms?

98
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:42,120
- I don't think so.

99
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,254
- Aphasia?
- No.

100
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:44,556
- Memory loss?
- No.

101
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:46,291
- Irritability?
- Yeah, that one!

102
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:48,193
- Don't deflect.
He cares about you.

103
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,294
You care about him.
- You shouldn't be practicing.

104
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:50,195
At least--
- Tell him--

105
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,030
- Enough!

106
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,569
Don't give me the look.
I told you I was hallucinating.

107
00:05:57,636 --> 00:05:59,137
- Who were you talking to?

108
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:01,039
- Someone
who's not actually here.

109
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:02,607
Beyond that seems irrelevant.

110
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:04,843
- Your mind made a choice.
It means something.

111
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,011
- You know
he's just gonna keep asking.

112
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,046
- Kutner.

113
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,351
- Good choice.
He feels bad.

114
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:14,953
- You gonna help me or not?

115
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:17,889
- Yeah.

116
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:24,028
- I could eat from this place
seven days a week.

117
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:26,431
- We practically do.

118
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:27,899
- You can order
tomorrow night.

119
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,901
Do you want some wine?

120
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,302
- No, thanks.

121
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:34,272
I have my husband's sperm.

122
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:39,744
- Your dead husband's?

123
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:43,214
- We froze it
when he got diagnosed.

124
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:46,851
- And you kept it?

125
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,620
All this time?

126
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:51,089
- I used to think
if I didn't find anyone, then--

127
00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:52,557
- You found someone.

128
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,359
- I know,

129
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:55,627
But...

130
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:57,195
- What if it goes wrong?

131
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:59,464
What if I turn out to be

132
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:02,066
a-a radical anarchist
with a secret family

133
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:03,167
and that I-I age backwards?

134
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,539
- Nobody plans
on getting divorced.

135
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,809
I didn't plan
on my husband dying.

136
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:14,312
But he did.

137
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,916
- So you--you're saying
you want a prenup...

138
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,286
in liquid form.

139
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,560
- What if it's not
sleep apnea?

140
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:32,163
Trauma from
your motorcycle accident?

141
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:34,098
Vicodin abuse?

142
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,466
You need to be admitted.

143
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,001
- I know you're wrong
about sleep apnea,

144
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:39,237
which means <i>you</i> know
you're wrong about sleep apnea.

145
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:40,972
You're scared.
Tell him you're scared.

146
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,544
- I can't sleep with you here.

147
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:04,495
- Did it work?

148
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,965
- Do you see someone
standing beside me?

149
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,299
- No.

150
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,101
- Then, no.

151
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,271
- So what's next on your list
of things it's not?

152
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:15,306
- Patient's not responding
to the antibiotics.

153
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:16,607
Still can't breathe.

154
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,543
- So run a test
to confirm it's pneumonia.

155
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,777
- We can't do a bronc

156
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:20,812
because her lungs
are still collapsed.

157
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,014
- Transtracheal aspiration.

158
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,516
- That's basically
waterboarding.

159
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:26,651
- It is pretty radical.

160
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:27,685
- It's a great idea.

161
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,854
- Regular radical,

162
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,356
me radical,

163
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,257
or me out of my mind radical?

164
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,793
- Somewhere
between regular and you.

165
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:38,396
- So what's the problem?

166
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,298
- Everything okay?

167
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:41,699
- No.

168
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:44,635
Our patient can't breathe.

169
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:47,105
Either do the test
or come up with a better one.

170
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:55,213
So we're down to infection,

171
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,248
trauma, M.S., schizophrenia,

172
00:08:57,316 --> 00:08:58,783
or pills.

173
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,986
- Schizophrenia
usually manifests younger.

174
00:09:02,054 --> 00:09:03,755
- That's why
it's further down the list.

175
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:06,724
I can confirm an infection
with a simple blood test.

176
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,459
- An infection
can be treated...

177
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,494
cured.

178
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:10,995
Means you still got a job.

179
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:12,397
Means you still got a life.

180
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:15,967
It doesn't make it
a better idea, just a nicer one.

181
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:17,568
This the rational you talking?

182
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:21,839
- Can't do this on my own.

183
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:28,246
- When we inject the water,

184
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:29,881
it's gonna feel
like you're drowning.

185
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:31,682
But it'll be over
in a few seconds.

186
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,484
- Then it'll be better?

187
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:34,886
- A little.

188
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:38,022
- Hold her shoulders down
a little.

189
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:42,193
Ready?

190
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,037
- You're doing great.

191
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:55,106
Here comes the liquid.

192
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,380
- Taub.

193
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:03,614
- I slipped.

194
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:05,049
Oh, no.
- What?

195
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:06,551
- Her skin came off.

196
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,268
- Her skin is sloughing off

197
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:24,337
faster than we can replace it
with the artificial skin.

198
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:26,005
- Could be autoimmune.

199
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:27,173
- A.N.A. was negative.

200
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,675
- Focus on the lungs.

201
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:31,611
- You want us
to ignore the fact

202
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,145
that she's lost 80%
of her skin?

203
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:35,014
- We know
it's not lung cancer.

204
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:37,583
Could be a liver tumor,
eats through to the lungs.

205
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:39,752
Get an ultrasound of her liver.

206
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,921
If you find masses,
get a biopsy.

207
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,589
- We can't just ignore
the skin.

208
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:44,957
It's obviously
the most significant

209
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:46,659
and dangerous symptom
right now.

210
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,461
- I don't think
it is a symptom.

211
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,496
I think we caused it.

212
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:51,697
- By doing what?

213
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:54,166
- I prescribed antibiotics.

214
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:56,135
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis--

215
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:58,738
that's a one-in-a-million
reaction.

216
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:01,841
- Yeah, well,
maybe this is the one.

217
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,043
Get swabs
of her old skin to confirm.

218
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:23,829
Where the hell were you?

219
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:25,464
- I do have a practice.

220
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:28,234
- Ballerina
has toxic epidermal necrolysis.

221
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,236
- Are you sure?

222
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:32,104
- About to be.

223
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:37,643
- You didn't do anything wrong.
You prescribed antibiotics.

224
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,679
Any other doctor would've done
the exact same thing.

225
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:41,213
- Any other doctor?

226
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,648
Words can hurt, you know.

227
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:46,018
I have no reason
to feel guilty.

228
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:48,387
It doesn't make any sense...

229
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:51,023
unless there's something wrong
in the limbic area of my brain.

230
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:52,892
- Guilt as a symptom?

231
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,727
- It's consistent with M.S.

232
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,964
And since the blood tests
were negative,

233
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:00,900
I have to apologize.

234
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,301
If I feel better,
then you're right.

235
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:03,636
I was feeling an emotion.

236
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:06,238
If I feel nothing...

237
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:07,707
it means
my limbic brain is shot.

238
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:25,858
- I'm Dr. House.

239
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:29,528
Anyone explain
to you your status?

240
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:33,699
They found a mass
in my liver--cancer.

241
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,901
- They said they think
they can treat it

242
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:37,470
and that the skin
is starting to take.

243
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:38,804
- I'll be able to dance again.

244
00:12:38,872 --> 00:12:41,107
- She's half dead,

245
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:43,175
and she's wondering
if she'll ever plie again?

246
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:44,910
Healthy priorities.

247
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:47,012
Let the mocking begin.

248
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,383
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:54,553
I...

250
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:56,388
treated you for an infection

251
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,424
before confirming
that you had one.

252
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:00,926
That's why you lost your skin.

253
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:03,729
I know you're in pain.
I know that I caused it.

254
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:07,133
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,201
- Very nice.

256
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:14,540
- Thank you?

257
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:21,647
- Nothing.

258
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,458
- Maybe you didn't mean it.

259
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:34,426
- I meant it.

260
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,061
- Did you do a liver biopsy
to confirm--

261
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,164
- Couldn't. The artificial skin
was too thin.

262
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:40,065
She'd bleed out.

263
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:41,634
Why were you talking
to the patient?

264
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,136
- I think skinless women
are hot.

265
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:46,539
Do a transjugular liver biopsy.

266
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:49,341
If she bleeds,
at least it stays in her veins.

267
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,479
- Did you just check
with Wilson again?

268
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:55,080
- No.

269
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,655
I felt nothing.
It's M.S.

270
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,557
- Apologies aren't supposed
to make you feel better.

271
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:06,392
They're supposed to make
the other person feel better.

272
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,860
- In order
to make you feel better.

273
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:09,695
- Fine. You want to do
an L.P. to confirm,

274
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:12,798
or is guilt enough
to start filling prescriptions?

275
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:19,371
- Last mass about a centimeter
to your right.

276
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:23,375
Problem?

277
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:24,977
- Short burst of flutter.

278
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:26,111
We're almost done.

279
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,613
- Entering
the right hepatic vein.

280
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:32,218
Cameron kept
her dead husband's sperm.

281
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,956
- She doesn't like yours?

282
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:38,724
- She likes his better.

283
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,393
Or at least she...

284
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,996
wants to hang on to it
in case mine is...

285
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:45,531
unfaithful or something.

286
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,968
- Wow.

287
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:53,339
- Advancing two centimeters.

288
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:55,107
- You got to let her do it.

289
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:56,675
If you don't,

290
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,177
you'll be stuck
with her forever.

291
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,846
- I want to be stuck
with her forever.

292
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:03,782
- She married a dying guy.
She has issues.

293
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,584
You...

294
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,786
cannot leave her...

295
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:10,389
ever, for any reason,

296
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:12,191
'cause then you're not just
the guy who left her,

297
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,993
you're the guy
who killed her kids.

298
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:17,997
That's not a good rhythm.

299
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:19,365
Get out.

300
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,834
- Narrow complex tachycardia--
she's gonna crash.

301
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,683
- The biopsy was negative for cancer

302
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:31,085
but the procedure
sent her heart into a-fib.

303
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:32,620
- We don't know
it was the biopsy

304
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:33,921
that caused the heart problem.

305
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:35,256
Maybe the heart
caused the lungs to collapse.

306
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:36,858
- Why is Wilson here?

307
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:39,293
- You were looking for cancer.
Thought it'd be helpful if--

308
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:40,661
- We didn't find cancer.

309
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:43,064
- Yes, which you reported
to me five seconds ago.

310
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:44,565
Thought I'd let him finish
his hors d'oeuvre

311
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,200
before getting the bouncer
to take care of him.

312
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:48,236
- Until we can regulate
the heart,

313
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:49,604
we can't get
any meaningful pictures.

314
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:50,938
So we can't tell--

315
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:52,707
- Metoprolol
can correct irregular heart--

316
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:54,709
- Tried it.
Didn't work.

317
00:15:54,777 --> 00:15:55,910
Is Cuddy making him oversee--

318
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:57,045
- No.

319
00:15:57,112 --> 00:15:58,312
- Heart's too irregular
for MRI.

320
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,448
Other scans would--

321
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,483
- Then you're making him
oversee your choices.

322
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:05,486
You don't trust yourself.

323
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:06,821
Why?

324
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:11,125
- Wilson, get out.

325
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:12,794
- Are you sure?

326
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,196
- Do I need your approval
to throw you out?

327
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:22,637
- You happy now?

328
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,674
- There's only one time her
heart's gonna be perfectly still

329
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:28,876
for our pictures,
and that's when she's dead.

330
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:31,612
- If it's not M.S.,

331
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,481
severe mental illness

332
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:35,283
and vicodin
are all that's left.

333
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,419
Mental illness means...

334
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:39,954
you can no longer
practice medicine.

335
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:42,123
Vicodin means detox,

336
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:43,324
which means pain

337
00:16:43,392 --> 00:16:45,460
for the rest of your life,

338
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:48,529
which means you can no longer
practice medicine.

339
00:16:57,005 --> 00:17:00,041
- Are you saying
we should kill her?

340
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:01,809
- No.

341
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,013
- If we stopped her heart,

342
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,582
we could get our pictures
and then restart it.

343
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:10,184
- What if we can't restart it?

344
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:11,986
- Then she stays dead.

345
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:14,789
- We restart hearts
all the time.

346
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:16,757
- It'll take four minutes
for us to MRI

347
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:17,925
her entire heart.

348
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:19,260
- And we only have
three minutes

349
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,929
until there's brain damage.

350
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,197
You sure about this?

351
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,702
- Yeah.

352
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:31,572
We're gonna stop her heart
so I can MRI it.

353
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,040
I think it was her idea.

354
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:35,710
Pneumonia was her idea, and it
almost killed the patient.

355
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:37,478
- Her?

356
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:40,581
- Oops.

357
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:43,784
- Kutner was secretly a woman.

358
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:45,620
That's why he killed himself.

359
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:48,656
It's Amber.

360
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:51,893
- Your subconscious

361
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,895
picked my dead girlfriend?
- Yeah.

362
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:56,230
The irrational part of my brain

363
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:57,632
works like the rational part
of yours.

364
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,501
How about that?
- It...raises questions.

365
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:03,004
- It answers questions.
- Who cares?

366
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:05,606
I've got competing ideas.
They can't both be right.

367
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:07,608
- Everybody gets competing
ideas. Everybody has doubts.

368
00:18:07,676 --> 00:18:09,911
- So is it regular radical,
me radical,

369
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:11,512
or me out of my mind radical?

370
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,748
- It's on the upper end
of you radical.

371
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:15,183
Do you have any alternative?

372
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,986
- Nothing that anyone
in my head has come up with.

373
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,855
- Then you're
as safe as you can be.

374
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:22,323
- Great.

375
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:27,762
You get the L.P. results back?

376
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:29,197
Yeah.

377
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:30,831
It's a big shock.
You don't have M.S.

378
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:32,099
But while I had
your blood sample,

379
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,768
I checked vicodin levels--

380
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:35,102
way too high.

381
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,504
- I need the pills.

382
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:38,673
- Not an argument.
He knows that's not an argument.

383
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,007
- It could still be
schizophrenia.

384
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,008
- House...

385
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,044
if you're on anti-psych meds,

386
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:44,412
you're not gonna
be able to practice.

387
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,147
- I know.

388
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:48,683
- You'd prefer
electroshock therapy to rehab?

389
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,651
- I'd prefer something
that could actually work.

390
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,086
- You're rationalizing.

391
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:53,688
- No kidding.

392
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:57,258
- I know that you're afraid
of the pain, but electroshock--

393
00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:59,060
- Don't give me
the cancer voice,

394
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,462
that overly earnest tone.

395
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,197
- Heart attack, stroke,

396
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,066
seizure, death, or worse.

397
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,635
- Worse?
Double death?

398
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:09,904
- You live, but you damage
the only thing you care about--

399
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:10,938
your rational mind.

400
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,547
I'll make some calls.

401
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,855
- I'll actually be dead?

402
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:30,625
- Just your heart,
just for a little while.

403
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:31,692
- Hopefully.

404
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,113
- I had an idea.

405
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:55,383
- Stop having ideas.

406
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,751
- Insulin shock.

407
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:58,653
- Yes.

408
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,821
That's marginally
less dangerous than E.C.T.

409
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:02,089
puts you in a coma.
Could cause--

410
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,357
- Could work.

411
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:05,559
- If you had psychosis,
which you don't.

412
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:08,562
- I've had no diarrhea,
no sweating, no vomiting,

413
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,831
none of the symptoms
of vicodin overdose.

414
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,301
- Yeah, except
the "I see dead people" thing.

415
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:15,336
- I've been popping pills
for years.

416
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:17,071
I've only been seeing things
for days.

417
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:18,372
Something changed.

418
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,841
- Vicodin addiction
is still more likely.

419
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:23,711
- So we're no longer dealing
in absolutes.

420
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:25,146
- House, I'll be up
in five minutes.

421
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:26,314
Then we can talk
about how you'd rather be

422
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:28,049
in a coma than in rehab.

423
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:30,985
- Actually, if you could be
up here in two,

424
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:32,253
that'd be really helpful.

425
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:33,554
- Why?

426
00:20:33,622 --> 00:20:35,990
- 'Cause I'm about
to put myself

427
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:38,059
into insulin shock.

428
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:39,393
- Left atrium is fine.

429
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,495
- Left coronary artery
also fine.

430
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:42,630
We're almost at three minutes.
- Keep going.

431
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:44,065
- Chordae tendineae clear.

432
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:45,800
- Right atrium is fine.
- I got to start her back up.

433
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,168
- We have some time.
- We're over.

434
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:48,569
- Right coronary artery
is fine.

435
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:50,004
- The three-minute threshold
is a guideline.

436
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:51,572
- She might have less.
We have to stop.

437
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,607
- What's that by the aorta?

438
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:55,443
- I don't see anything.
- I'm restarting her heart.

439
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,711
- That's a shadow.
Two centimeters--

440
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:01,782
- You're only scared

441
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,684
because you know
this is gonna work.

442
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:15,262
- We're over three minutes.

443
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,680
- I need glucose in here!

444
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:32,229
You could've died.

445
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:42,539
- It worked.

446
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,643
Where are my pants?

447
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:50,547
- Are you sure?

448
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:52,449
- She's been everywhere
I've been for days.

449
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:55,686
She's not here, ergo...

450
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:57,521
- This was not
the next rational step.

451
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:58,922
- Now who's being biased?

452
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,426
You wanted me to detox
as much as I wanted--

453
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:05,462
I forgot how to do my zipper.

454
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,230
- Any other
neurological deficits?

455
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:10,100
- You don't seem to annoy me
as much as usual.

456
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:11,635
Not sure that's a deficit.

457
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:13,904
and...

458
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:16,106
I'm all better.

459
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,644
- Is she really gone?
- Absolutely.

460
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:24,381
I can feel myself repressing
all kinds of icky things.

461
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:25,615
I check out, don't I?

462
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:32,823
Damn.

463
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:39,896
- He didn't see anything.

464
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,231
He saw an artifact
on the monitor.

465
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:43,166
- It was a shadow
on her heart.

466
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:44,668
- She'd already been
technically dead

467
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:45,936
for three minutes.

468
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:48,305
I thought keeping her alive
took precedence

469
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:49,473
over prolonging the photo op.

470
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,640
- Any brain damage?

471
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,075
- No, all tests indicat--

472
00:23:52,143 --> 00:23:53,110
- Obviously you had more time.

473
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:55,946
Best of luck.

474
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,651
- I assume we can't kill her
again and take more pictures.

475
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,253
- Uh, you'll want to check
with Wilson?

476
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:04,788
- Good one.

477
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:06,590
- It's something, a lesion.

478
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:07,824
- Tumor, scar tissue.

479
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:09,126
- Could be an abscess,
infection.

480
00:24:09,193 --> 00:24:11,361
Explains why it's invisible
in the blood.

481
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:12,896
It's doing its damage
behind closed doors,

482
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:14,097
sealed off.

483
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:16,066
- See, the problem
with speculation

484
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:19,603
is you make a spec out of "u"
and some guy named "lation,"

485
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,538
which really
doesn't affect me at all.

486
00:24:21,606 --> 00:24:23,507
- We have to guess.
It's all we've got.

487
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:24,674
We can't do a biopsy.

488
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:25,742
Last time we went
into her heart,

489
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,412
she had a major cardiac event.

490
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:30,981
- Which just leaves...

491
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:37,687
- What are you looking for?

492
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:40,257
- I don't know yet.

493
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:42,292
- The picture doesn't change.

494
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,127
She lies there in pain.

495
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:46,963
He sits there worried.

496
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,802
- Nothing changes.

497
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,707
I just had an epiphany...

498
00:24:57,775 --> 00:24:59,576
all by myself.

499
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:01,144
Popped into my head
out of nothing.

500
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:02,379
- Care to share?

501
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:03,580
- He's too devoted.

502
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:06,183
- Too devoted?

503
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,350
You think he feels guilty?

504
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:08,885
- Right, I'm being cynical.

505
00:25:08,953 --> 00:25:11,254
People can care because they
care, not because they cheated,

506
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:12,923
theoretically true.

507
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,324
But gonorrhea fits better.

508
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:16,493
- No. No STDs.
We tested her.

509
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:17,761
- You tested her blood.

510
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:19,362
- That is the test.

511
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,499
- That's not
where her problem is.

512
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:25,101
Gonorrhea disseminated
to her heart,

513
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:26,770
got walled off in an abscess.

514
00:25:26,838 --> 00:25:27,904
It'd be invisible.

515
00:25:27,972 --> 00:25:29,105
- And...

516
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:30,807
would look like a shadow.

517
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,375
- No need to test her again,

518
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,277
but we can check
Prince Charming.

519
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:35,679
Once you confirm,

520
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:37,080
cut the abscess
out of her heart.

521
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:43,887
- Here are your onion rings,
extra well-done.

522
00:25:43,955 --> 00:25:45,455
- Thank you, Molly.

523
00:25:45,523 --> 00:25:46,823
And another beer
when you get a chance.

524
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:47,891
I'm celebrating.

525
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:49,893
- Alone?

526
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:51,628
- Thank goodness.

527
00:25:58,369 --> 00:25:59,669
Don't tell me.
I was right.

528
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,905
- Yep.
Boyfriend has gonorrhea.

529
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:04,574
- And everyone's a winner.
- He's not too happy about it.

530
00:26:04,642 --> 00:26:06,443
He insists he's never cheated
and must've gotten it from her.

531
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,445
- Don't think so.

532
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:09,846
- Timing would fit.

533
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:11,348
He's got no symptoms,
and she's dying.

534
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:13,316
- Lying would fit too.

535
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:15,652
- He's not hanging out
in her room anymore.

536
00:26:17,555 --> 00:26:19,022
What does it matter?
You were right.

537
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,658
We're prepping her for surgery.

538
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:26,997
- I saw guilt in him.

539
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,768
If he's not actually guilty...

540
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:33,103
then I wasn't right.

541
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,038
I was lucky.

542
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:36,339
- House,

543
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:38,108
you made a brilliant deduction
about her heart.

544
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,278
- And if I was just lucky...

545
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:53,957
- # enjoy #

546
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:57,294
# yourself #

547
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:01,898
# it's later than you think #

548
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:04,134
# enjoy #

549
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:07,070
# yourself #

550
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:10,574
# while you're still
in the pink #

551
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:13,543
# the years #

552
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:15,612
# go by #

553
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:21,651
# as quickly as a wink #

554
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:23,753
# enjoy yourself #

555
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:25,422
- Wilson...

556
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:27,524
come get me.

557
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:29,859
# it's later than you think #

558
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:48,058
- I know a nice facility
outside Philly.

559
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,694
I went to undergrad
with one of the directors.

560
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,931
- Thanks.

561
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:08,979
How many shirts do I need?

562
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:11,481
- They said three.

563
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:12,749
They have laundry.

564
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,685
- Like living with mom again--

565
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:16,787
delightful.

566
00:28:18,223 --> 00:28:19,556
- It's probably Foreman.

567
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:24,027
- He's unavailable.

568
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:25,929
- Tell her the infection's
made her septic.

569
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,898
We can't remove the abscess
until we get her B.P. up.

570
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:29,700
And it's not responding
to fluids. It's not--

571
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:31,101
He's off the case.

572
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:35,439
- Patient okay?

573
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,406
- Yeah.

574
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:37,741
- He's lying.

575
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,620
- Why don't I feel scared?

576
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:52,256
- I'd say you're unaware
of what you're feeling

577
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:54,725
at this moment.

578
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:56,226
- I feel like crap.

579
00:28:56,294 --> 00:28:59,796
My life is falling apart,
but I don't feel scared...

580
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,399
not of the rehab anyway.

581
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:04,101
- We've always been able
to find a way to cheat.

582
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,909
- It won't work.

583
00:29:11,976 --> 00:29:13,844
- You want it
to work this time.

584
00:29:13,912 --> 00:29:15,345
- Do we?

585
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,514
- House...

586
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:19,216
it's your only option.

587
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:22,486
- What do I do
if my only option won't work?

588
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,623
- You don't give up.

589
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,227
- Hmm.

590
00:29:30,295 --> 00:29:32,829
It's either that
or electroshock every six hours.

591
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,335
Good night, Wilson.

592
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,170
- What if we put her
on a heart-lung machine?

593
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:41,972
- She's septic.

594
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,340
We don't need
a heart-lung machine.

595
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,075
We need a "blood vessel
holder together" machine.

596
00:29:45,143 --> 00:29:46,743
- We could try
high-dose dopamine.

597
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:48,278
It's a vasoconstrictor.

598
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,747
It'll close the blood vessels
so she won't bleed out.

599
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:51,915
- Her heart can't take
that much dopamine.

600
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:53,183
It'll explode.

601
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,818
- And if we don't use
the dopamine,

602
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:55,919
it'll implode.

603
00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:58,155
- Is House really done?

604
00:29:58,222 --> 00:30:00,090
- It sounded that way.

605
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,494
- Dopamine it is.

606
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:25,782
- It's late, and I'm tired.

607
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,285
Can we get to the talking part
of this conversation?

608
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,556
I quit.

609
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,224
- Great.

610
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:39,363
My nanny
is off the clock at 7:30,

611
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,964
so...

612
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:42,966
your week off,

613
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:45,502
bigger desk...

614
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,704
tighter nurses uniforms,

615
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:51,174
or whatever other stupid thing
you're about to demand

616
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:53,610
is gonna have to wait until--

617
00:30:53,678 --> 00:30:55,545
- You can go suckle
the little bastard child

618
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:56,980
who makes you feel good
about yourself.

619
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:01,084
- Screw you.

620
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,791
- Don't do this.

621
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:09,359
- I'm hallucinating.

622
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:13,663
- From the vicodin?

623
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,068
- Ruled out everything else.

624
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,477
- We can, uh...

625
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:30,480
admit you through the E.R.
under a pseudonym.

626
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:32,883
No one has to...
- I'll cheat...

627
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,984
Scam,

628
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:35,619
find some way to keep using.

629
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,120
- These people
know what they're doing.

630
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:38,522
- These people don't know me.

631
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,926
You do.
- She's not your keeper.

632
00:31:42,994 --> 00:31:45,862
She has no responsibility
for you.

633
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,866
- I need you.

634
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:57,441
- Let me call my babysitter.

635
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:14,582
- Blood pressure's 90 over 60.
- We know.

636
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:16,317
- I'm just saying.

637
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:18,619
It's still 90 over 60.
It's holding.

638
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,154
- Abscess is intact.

639
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:22,056
Doesn't look like any of the
surrounding tissue is affected.

640
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:23,657
She's gonna be fine.

641
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:25,760
- Doctor.

642
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:40,808
- We've got a problem.

643
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:50,951
- Lie down.
I'll get you some tea.

644
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:54,555
Yeah...

645
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:56,757
then I'll be better.

646
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,367
- Do you really think
she hasn't searched this place

647
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:08,135
for your secret stash?

648
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:15,176
- I already did this room...

649
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:19,146
and the bathroom
and your bedroom.

650
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:21,182
Where should I look,
in the kitchen?

651
00:33:24,386 --> 00:33:27,388
Coffee cup in--
in the top shelf.

652
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,123
- That was a test.

653
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:30,458
I already did the kitchen.

654
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,092
- Nicely played--

655
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,396
She'll think you've come clean,
given her everything.

656
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:38,098
There's more.

657
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:40,401
- Don't!
You're hurting already.

658
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:42,636
It'll only get worse.

659
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:45,139
- House, you should tell me
where it is now,

660
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:47,842
because you won't have the will
to tell me in two hours.

661
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,315
My shoes in the closet.

662
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:59,420
- It's like I don't even know
who you are anymore.

663
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,996
Aah!

664
00:34:09,064 --> 00:34:10,431
- It's okay.
Shh.

665
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,299
Hold my hand.

666
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:33,988
- Am I okay?

667
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:36,357
- We were able to
successfully remove the abscess

668
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:37,625
from your heart.

669
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:39,326
But the dopamine
caused the blood vessels

670
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:40,661
in your hands and feet

671
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:42,630
to clamp shut.

672
00:34:42,697 --> 00:34:45,666
We need to amputate,
or the gangrene will spread.

673
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,535
You'll die.

674
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:50,704
My feet?

675
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:52,673
- And your hands.

676
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:54,074
I'm sorry.

677
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,347
- No.
I'm a dancer.

678
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:02,816
- The tissue can't be saved.

679
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:05,586
- No.

680
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,726
- We know what House would do.

681
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:14,962
- House would have never woken
her up to ask for consent.

682
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,997
If you can't live with the
answer, don't ask the question.

683
00:35:17,065 --> 00:35:18,899
- You're saying we should
accept her decision?

684
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:20,167
- Bold idea, I know.

685
00:35:20,235 --> 00:35:21,468
- Maybe we can get
the boyfriend

686
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,836
to convince her to do it.

687
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:24,705
- Yeah, boyfriends
get everything they want.

688
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:27,875
- Forget it.

689
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:29,310
The boyfriend doesn't want
to talk to her anymore.

690
00:35:31,313 --> 00:35:33,647
- Where are you going?
- Home. The case is over.

691
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,249
- No, it's not.

692
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:38,419
Not until we come up
with something that might work.

693
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:40,054
It's a shame
that she might die

694
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,957
because House has some
personal crap to work through.

695
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:44,758
- Technically, if she dies,

696
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:46,994
it's because House has some
personal crap to work through,

697
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,730
<i>and</i> we weren't smart enough
to get the answer without him.

698
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:08,248
False alarm.

699
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:10,384
- Drink this.

700
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:12,686
- That's your advice--
drink this?

701
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,855
It's Ginger.

702
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,657
It'll ease the nausea.

703
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:18,125
- You know
what would calm the nausea?

704
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:20,561
Vicodin...

705
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:22,696
marijuana...

706
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,164
a coma.

707
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:28,802
- Oh, don't pretend
you didn't see it.

708
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,237
I saw it,
which means you saw it.

709
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:33,407
Send her away.

710
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:40,781
- Too bitter.

711
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:43,150
I already had enough bitter.

712
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:44,952
- I'll add some Honey.

713
00:36:51,593 --> 00:36:53,627
- You're pathetic.

714
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:55,496
If you want the pill,
just send her home.

715
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:58,132
But you can't,

716
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,601
because that would be
admitting defeat to her.

717
00:37:14,616 --> 00:37:16,216
Now, this is interesting.

718
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:19,753
If you take the pill,
you don't deserve her.

719
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,722
If you secretly
take the pill,

720
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,158
you don't deserve anyone.

721
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,165
- No!

722
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:33,400
- Aah!

723
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:34,435
No!

724
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,436
No!

725
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,024
- This isn't gonna work.

726
00:37:57,092 --> 00:38:00,094
- It might work.
That's all we're going for.

727
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:01,862
Vasodilators can--

728
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,398
- Big jump from reopening
to reanimating.

729
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:07,634
I'm out of the ulnar.

730
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,204
I'm not seeing any clearing.
This won't work.

731
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:12,139
- This probably won't work.

732
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,440
- Radial artery's
really tight.

733
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:14,842
- Don't go too fast.

734
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:16,477
If it clots,
she loses the hand.

735
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,879
- If it clots, she's dead.

736
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:24,585
- I can't believe it.

737
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:26,286
- What?

738
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,257
- It might be working.

739
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,974
- Can you stop?

740
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:50,577
The breathing.

741
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:52,980
- Air goes in,
air goes out.

742
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:55,616
- Then use your nose.

743
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:57,851
- You're supposed to feel
like crap.

744
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,387
You're doing great.

745
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:02,990
- And after?

746
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:05,692
- You come back to work.

747
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,261
- What if I can't?

748
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,600
- Opioid dependency can make

749
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:17,404
you think you have more pain
than you really have.

750
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:19,106
You're gonna be okay.

751
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:21,542
- You're telling me what I want
to hear with no evidence.

752
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,877
- I'm telling you
what I believe to be the truth.

753
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,279
- With no evidence.

754
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:27,514
- You're hardly
the most unbiased observer.

755
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:28,816
- Neither are you.

756
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:34,221
I'm your hospital's
biggest asset.

757
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:37,524
- Is that
why you think I'm here?

758
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,326
- It's why you're here.

759
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:40,861
It's why you're lying
to me about--

760
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:44,097
- I haven't lied to you
in 20 years.

761
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:45,132
- Sure you have.

762
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:50,671
Which means
that you just said that

763
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:52,239
because you want to tell me
what you lied to me about

764
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,340
20 years ago.

765
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,245
You're an ass.

766
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,113
- Am I wrong?

767
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,818
- I wasn't
in your endocrinology class.

768
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:10,190
- You sat next to me.
I cheated off you on--

769
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:11,625
- I audited
your endocrinology class.

770
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,995
- Why would you--

771
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:19,967
- Because I thought
you were an interesting lunatic

772
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:21,668
even then.

773
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,807
- I'm not here
protecting hospital property.

774
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:40,053
- We're alone.

775
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:44,691
- We've been alone all night.

776
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:48,629
- No, I mean Amber.

777
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:51,899
She's gone.

778
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:12,819
- Where's Jeremy?

779
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,322
- He left.

780
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,228
You okay?

781
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,342
- The surgery worked.

782
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,878
- Congratulations.

783
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:42,716
- # you've had a hard time #

784
00:41:42,784 --> 00:41:44,284
- I can't do it.

785
00:41:44,352 --> 00:41:47,020
- # living with a hard heart #

786
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,556
- You have doubts.

787
00:41:49,624 --> 00:41:51,558
- You don't?

788
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,527
- # you hardly feel #

789
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,728
- No.

790
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:55,963
- # a thing #

791
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,064
# and you don't know where #

792
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:58,298
- Well, that's...

793
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:01,201
# to start #

794
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,235
naive.

795
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:04,805
I-I want to spend

796
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:06,073
the rest of my life with you.

797
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,174
I love you.

798
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:08,775
That's how I feel right now,

799
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:10,243
but...

800
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:12,746
I don't...

801
00:42:12,814 --> 00:42:14,781
know.

802
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:18,986
- I'll wait until you do.

803
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:21,188
- # it won't be long, long #

804
00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:23,090
- I ca--I can't know.

805
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:27,227
No--no one knows.

806
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:31,698
- I do.

807
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:35,702
- # it's coming
after you all day #

808
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,870
# surrounding #

809
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,974
- I'll see you in later?

810
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:42,709
I have some papers
to push for you.

811
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:45,178
- # when you look
at me that way #

812
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:46,380
# I don't know
the thing to say #

813
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:47,781
- Thank you.

814
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:54,121
- You want to kiss me,
don't you?

815
00:42:56,724 --> 00:43:02,229
- I always want
to kiss you.

816
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:05,032
- # come on,
come on and try #

817
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,668
# ooh ooh ooh ooh #

818
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:10,971
# come on,
come on and sail away #

819
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,977
# sail away sail away
sail away #

820
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:20,814
# sail away sail away
sail away #

821
