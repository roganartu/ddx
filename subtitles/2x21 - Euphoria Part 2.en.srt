1
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:06,336
Previously on "House".

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,642
You high, Popo?

3
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:11,953
Caught with a sense of humor.
You can check the cop car.

4
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:15,330
Also check
his personal car, work, home.

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,316
Foreman, get out!

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,659
Am I the only one
who finds this funny?

7
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:20,650
- You stole my article.
- I wouldn't do that.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,731
We're not friends,
we're colleagues.

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,369
Ow! Son of a bitch!

10
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:25,515
Now we're both exposed.

11
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:28,024
- I'm gonna die.
- You die, I die.

12
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:29,425
It's not gonna happen.

13
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:33,495
Time of death,
12:26 p.m.

14
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,825
I need a bone saw.

15
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,358
- I'm sorry.
- You said you--
- I wish I could.

16
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:42,358
I just want a little tiny slice of
this guy's brain, that's all I need.

17
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,374
Just enough to tell me
what's killing Foreman.

18
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,931
A thin slice of Joe's brain could
also causea public health crisis.

19
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,190
It's not a good idea to scream "fire"
every time somebody lights a match.

20
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:52,853
Don't downplay this, House.

21
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:55,601
You put both of them
in isolation for a reason.

22
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:58,649
Joe's death elevates this situation
to a biosafety level 3.

23
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,248
Ooh, level 3.

24
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:02,771
- You should call Jack Bauer.
- I called the CDC.

25
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,609
Well, tell them
I'll be really, really careful.

26
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:07,460
We don't have the proper equipment
for you to be really, really careful.

27
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:10,554
You can do whatever you want to Foreman,
but the CDC will do this autopsy.

28
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:13,319
Whatever. The point is,
we'll be lucky to get results in 3 days.

29
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:14,813
I told them
how urgent this is.

30
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:15,780
And they told you?

31
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:17,403
We'll have the results
in 3 days.

32
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:18,938
Aw, that's a shame.

33
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:23,053
Because Foreman will
never get to know what it was.
He'll be dead in 36 hours.

34
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:25,770
Maybe this is a toxin.
Maybe it's notcontagious at all,

35
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:27,975
and you're killing Foreman
because of a maybe.

36
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:31,028
Well, you have 36 hours
to figure out which one it is.

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,261
Foreman.
Come here, fast.

38
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:42,738
What's going on?

39
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,042
When are they
doing the autopsy?

40
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:45,388
You're doing it. Now.

41
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,903
You ever study how they used
to do ice pick lobotomies?

42
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:49,478
I read about it in med school.
Why would I--

43
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:52,351
Shove an ice pick into the eye socket.
Just above the tear duct.

44
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:54,526
Bang it a couple of times
with a hammer, get a sample.

45
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,214
What's going on, man?

46
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,950
Foreman, you can't do it.
You'll be in violation of--

47
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,190
Can't do the time
if you're not alive.

48
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:03,996
You. I need you to suit up.
Get that equipment away
from Dr. Foreman.

49
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,699
House:
Take your time, guys.

50
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:07,112
Why don't you just
tell him to go slow?

51
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,700
- Won't be your fault.
- Foreman.

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,621
We don't even know what kind of
contagion we're dealing with.

53
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,650
Which is why we need
to chop into the guy's head.

54
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,408
- It's dangerous.
- Not to you, Foreman.

55
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:16,160
There are other ways
to diagnose you.

56
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:18,385
Yeah?
You have the answer?

57
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:22,684
- Foreman, do it now.
- I am warning you, do not--

58
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:28,471
What are you doing?

59
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,390
That didn't feel right.

60
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:32,488
He's blind.

61
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,111
He thinks he can see.

62
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:36,714
Same as the cop.

63
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,030
I need something
to bag the sample.

64
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:40,637
Forget it.
You just biopsied a mattress.

65
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:42,119
No, no, no. I'm fine.

66
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,679
House, there's the sample.
Get it, test it.

67
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:46,713
You gotta test that sample!

68
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:50,232
Apparently I was optimistic
about the 36 hours.

69
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:54,194
Intractable, unbearable pain
is up next.

70
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:57,565
Sure you don't want to reconsider
that whole autopsy thing?

71
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:06,535
2X21 - Euphoria, Part 2

72
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:31,990
Original Airdate (FOX): 3 MAY-2006

73
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,777
Physically,
his eyes are fine.

74
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,976
Problem's isolated
to his brain.

75
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,486
Damage to the occipital lobe
extends from the primary visual cortex--

76
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,385
Should we test him
for bacterial meningitis?

77
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,507
If it was meningitis,
we'd all be sick.

78
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:50,227
- His CSF could show signs--
- That would be pointless.

79
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:52,907
We already did a brain biopsy.
It was negative.

80
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,527
- Toxic mold?
- If it was toxic mold, I'd be sick.

81
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,102
How do we know
you're not sick?

82
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:01,609
Do I seem happy to you?

83
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:02,648
Never.

84
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,788
[Snorts]

85
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:05,654
It was funny.

86
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,469
Well, let's assume
it's not blood-borne.

87
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:10,263
If you start cracking jokes,
we can re-assess.

88
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:13,665
In the meantime,
stay away from people and animals
that you care about.

89
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,012
Guillain-Barr.

90
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:23,211
Neither of them had
any sort of paralysis.

91
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,980
Joe could have died before
the paralysis had a chance to present.

92
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,702
What about arbovirus?

93
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:28,933
Start treatment.

94
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:30,218
For arbovirus?

95
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:33,932
You think our Jersey beat cop
has been spending a lot of time
exploring deep, dark Africa?

96
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,530
Treatment  for everything.

97
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:38,219
Likely or unlikely.
If you can think of it, treat for it.

98
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:41,466
Mixing that many meds will
create all sorts of toxic interactions.

99
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,499
We'll box his liver, trash his kidneys.
There's got to be a better way.

100
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,201
Of course
there's a better way!

101
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:50,162
It's that body
sitting in the room with him
that Cuddy won't let us touch.

102
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:56,395
Bacterials, virals,
toxins, fungals, parasites.
It's got to be one of them.

103
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,531
Where are you going?

104
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,523
To see if I can find
another brain to biopsy.

105
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:05,383
We're going to lock Joe up downstairs
until the CDC gets here.

106
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:09,174
Foreman, you can't see.

107
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:11,133
Right.

108
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,230
House wants
to start you on some meds.

109
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,384
They're in the airlock.

110
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:15,412
For what?

111
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,768
Leading candidate
is toxic mold.

112
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:19,244
Is Cameron sick?

113
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:21,665
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

114
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:25,018
You're  casting your net a little wider
than toxic mold, aren't you?

115
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:26,889
Guillain-Barr
is also on the table.

116
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:32,133
This is an oval shape...
Has either an L or a 7.
I'm guessing an L.

117
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:35,011
Levofloxacin, because
you can't rule out bacteria.

118
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:39,540
8, 0, 0.
That's the dosage for
the acyclovir in case it's viral.

119
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:44,310
Square...
No, more like a rhombus.
That's fluconazole for fungus.

120
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:45,699
There's about 8 others here.
You--

121
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:47,078
You're treating me
for everything.

122
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:48,521
You have no idea
what I've got.

123
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,302
House thinks this is
the best course of action.

124
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:52,908
House is desperate.
House is never desperate.

125
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:54,332
Something we give you will work.

126
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:57,144
Yeah, we should start
treating all patients this way.

127
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:59,117
When they get sick,
they just take everything.

128
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:01,684
It's better than doing nothing.

129
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,413
[Phone rings]

130
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:33,102
Hello?

131
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:34,966
I'm at the cop's place.

132
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,049
I need to retrace your steps.

133
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:39,597
You don't think the
"treat him for everything" approach
is enough?

134
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,353
Where did you
start your search?

135
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,184
The kitchen.

136
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:44,713
You will tell me
everything you did,
everything you touched.

137
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:47,000
If you went to the john,
I want to know when and why.

138
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:49,655
I started with samples
from the mold in his sink.

139
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:06,438
- What next?
- That's it. Then I left.

140
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,564
Foreman:
<i>What do we do now?</i>

141
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,640
Wait for Steve McQueen
to get giddy.

142
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,957
[Calling]

143
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,389
Hey, Dad.
It's Eric.

144
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:33,054
I'm not doing too good.

145
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:38,485
How's Foreman?

146
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,455
You're accessing a webcam?

147
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,403
Cuddy's shower.

148
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:46,816
Are you a fan of the Brazilian?
I-I--

149
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,746
Is that your kitchen?

150
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,629
Well, obviously
I couldn't bring him here.

151
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:52,414
He's been exposed to
whatever Foreman's got.

152
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:54,026
You infected Steve?

153
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,678
Why didn't you just get
a rat from the pet store?

154
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:59,540
Because... I needed one
with a clean medical history.

155
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:02,867
Who knowswhat kind of antibiotics they give those rats?

156
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:06,331
So this is your plan? Just sit here
and watch your rat all day?

157
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:08,355
Well, it shouldn't take long.

158
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:11,904
Got the AC blasting,
I soaped the floor of his cage...

159
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,483
As soon as he gets sick,
I do an autopsy.

160
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:15,754
As soon as he's dead.

161
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:19,861
Right after he gets sick,
there's a good chance he'll
get hit in the head with a...

162
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,784
cane-shaped object.

163
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:24,763
Normally you just use
your patients as lab rats.

164
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,437
It's a nice change.

165
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,558
First symptom is euphoria.

166
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:36,613
How do you know
if a rat's euphoric?

167
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:40,402
He doesn't usually climb
on his water bottle like that, does he?

168
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:49,616
The seizures only seem to happen

- She starts to rock and grunt.
- She responsive?

170
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:55,846
No, no, it's like she's in a zone.

171
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:59,365
And her abdominal muscles
become dystonic.

172
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,222
Big word.

173
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:02,847
Someone's been
on the InterWeb.

174
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:05,375
I looked up
a few articles on epilepsy.

175
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:07,681
You  know,
there's actually some really
great youth soccer leagues,

176
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,344
that would cater specifically
to her special needs, and...

177
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:14,051
I think it might explain
why she's been having
a hard time in preschool.

178
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,508
Let's confirm your diagnosis
before you have her held back.

179
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,628
Strobing lights and
high-pitched sounds
can provoke a seizure.

180
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:26,602
[Silly ghost noise]
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

181
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:28,024
You're a goof.

182
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:30,267
Takes one to know one, loser.

183
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:33,108
Wait, that means I'm a loser.
Scratch that.

184
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:36,685
These episodes.
She get sweaty afterwards?

185
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:38,214
Soaking wet.

186
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,585
And does she seem
upset by them, or just tired?

187
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,292
No, she kind of thinks it's funny.

188
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:48,518
You mix rocking, grunting, sweating,
and dystonia with concerned parents,

189
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:51,526
and you get
an amateur diagnosis of epilepsy.

190
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:58,002
In actuality,
all your little girl is doing is
saying "yoo hoo" to the "hoo hoo."

191
00:09:58,086 --> 00:10:00,317
- She's what?
- Marching the penguin.

192
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:03,628
Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood.

193
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:07,156
Finding Nemo.
[Chuckles]

194
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:09,231
That was funny.

195
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:11,006
It's called
gratification disorder.

196
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,019
Sort of a misnomer.
If one was unable to gratify oneself,
that would be a disorder.

197
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:17,020
Are you saying
she's masturbating?

198
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,459
I was trying to be discreet.
There's a child in the room.

199
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,147
- Oh, this is horrifying.
- Epilepsy is horrifying.

200
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:26,867
Teach your girl about privacy
and he'll be fine. Here you go.

201
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:28,436
Thank you.

202
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,016
One afternoon, and
you're on pace to set the record
for most patients seen in a month.

203
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,923
You're upset that I'm doing clinic hours?
Wow, that is so like rain on your wedding day.

204
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:41,801
For the past 3 hours,
I have been on the phone with the CDC,
while you are--

205
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:43,555
Yeah, how's that going,
by the way?

206
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:44,631
They promised to expedite--

207
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,891
Tough to do an autopsy when
they haven't even picked up the body.

208
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:49,047
It's tough to treat your patient
when you're not even on the same floor.

209
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:50,630
Go. Clinic is covered.

210
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:53,947
I go watch the meds drip into his IV.
You think that'll make the treatment work faster?

211
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:55,980
Go to your office.
Play with your ball.

212
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:58,101
Write on your whiteboard.
Insult your team.

213
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:00,920
Do whatever it is that you do
to figure things out.

214
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:01,885
Feeling guilty?

215
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:03,360
It's not too late
to change your mind.

216
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,520
Go call the CDC.
Tell 'em you were just joshing.

217
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:07,961
Keep avoiding Foreman's case
until he dies.

218
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:09,767
Then I'll drown in guilt.

219
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,876
Feeling any better?

220
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,149
How are you doing?

221
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,779
I'm not the patient.

222
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,832
Is your sed rate elevated?

223
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,197
No.

224
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:22,873
So far, it looks
like I lucked out.

225
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:24,640
C ameron.

226
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:28,045
Looks like you left
a tourniquet on the bed.

227
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:31,529
You can see again?

228
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,982
The treatment's working.

229
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,433
The question is,
which treatment?

230
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:38,216
We'll start weaning him off
one at a time.

231
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,136
Which one do we start with?

232
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,610
I don't care
if you do it alphabetically.
Just stay on top of his vision.

233
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,067
First sign of regression means
we've taken him off the wrong one.

234
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:47,095
The latest blood work.

235
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,907
Foreman's  amylase and lipase levels
are 3 times normal.

236
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:52,633
Pancreas is failing.

237
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:55,219
A toxic side effect of his meds.

238
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,960
[Retching]

239
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,553
House:
Philosophical question.

240
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,412
How do you want to die?

241
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:24,853
Old age.

242
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:29,306
Your choice is currently
between 4 hours from now
and 14 hours from now.

243
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,404
So I'm assuming that means
you want the latter.

244
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:33,157
The cocktail's working.

245
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:35,218
My vision's almost
completely restored.

246
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:38,685
The meds are curing what's in your head,
but they're trashing your pancreas.

247
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:41,600
That's why you're puking and
you can't stand up without screaming.

248
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,342
So lower the dosages.

249
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:45,987
Less stress on my pancreas,
still battle the infection.

250
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:47,602
Lower dosages
will still be toxic.

251
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:49,219
I don't care!

252
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,710
I can handle the pain
of the pancreatitis.

253
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:55,021
I don't think
you can handle life
without a pancreas.

254
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:04,285
We keep you on these meds,
you'll spend the last 4 hours
of your life being able to see.

255
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:07,343
Take you off,
you'll go blind again.

256
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:11,741
But it'll give us time
to figure out what's eating your brain.

257
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,889
Fine.

258
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:18,710
What do we do next?

259
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:20,629
Man:
Eric?

260
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:25,910
Dad?

261
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,410
Yeah, you two can get caught up later.
Sir, I need you to come with me.

262
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,237
House.
Uh...what is this?

263
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,079
He isn't a what, he's a who.

264
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:43,868
They even have
the right to vote now.

265
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:47,381
Rodney Foreman, Cuddy.
Cuddy, Rodney Foreman.

266
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,971
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.
- This is Foreman's dad.

267
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:52,469
Yeah, I got that.

268
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,616
And Dr. Cuddy, here,
is the Dean of Medicine.

269
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:58,782
Remember that cool autopsy
I was telling you about, the one
that would save your son's life?

270
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,921
She's the one can give us
the green light to do it.

271
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:04,838
I understand
you don't want them to do it.

272
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,848
Dr. House didn't
seem to know why.

273
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:13,977
Mr. Foreman, I am doing
everything I can to get the CDC--

274
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:14,973
Won't be soon enough.

275
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:18,383
And my decision to follow
public health safety protocols--

276
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:23,163
Oh, don't blame the rules.
Don't want to hang this
on policy and protocol.

277
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:25,982
I'm well aware that
it may cost your son his life,

278
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:32,958
just as I am well aware that my decision has
a devastating effect on family and friends
without having them paraded in front of me.

279
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:39,955
Your son has an unknown,
contagious, deadly infection.

280
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,193
If we don't contain it here,
even more people could be at risk.

281
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:50,264
And I am capable of
empathizing with those people too
without having them paraded in front of me.

282
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:04,044
I understand.

283
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:22,772
What's wrong with your hand?

284
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,345
It's--it's called
a muscle contraction.

285
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:28,184
I thought this thing
was in your brain.

286
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:29,222
It is.

287
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:34,464
It just means the infection's moved
to the primary motor cortex,
which controls the muscles.

288
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:37,748
Aren't you glad
you sent me to med school?

289
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:39,573
Does it hurt?

290
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:40,675
No.

291
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:43,133
Is it gonna?

292
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,949
The-- the other guy...

293
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:53,567
He didn't seem to suffer too much,
he--just went in his sleep.

294
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,146
Steve still acting normal?
No sign of contractures.

295
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:12,005
They got the cop's body
in a locked, airtight bag.

296
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:16,031
And a guard on the door.
These Feds are seriously paranoid.

297
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,962
He hasn't gotten up
to peein hours. He's due.

298
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:21,395
You haven't sprinkled
Senokot granules on his doughnut?

299
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,211
His bowels would open up
like the Red Sea.

300
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:24,924
He wouldn't eat the doughnut.

301
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,435
Have you seriously
been down here for hours?

302
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:29,316
No.

303
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:32,430
I had to pee a couple times.

304
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:34,370
You've got to stop
blaming Cuddy for this.

305
00:16:34,436 --> 00:16:36,442
Given that it is her fault,
that seems appropriate.

306
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:37,740
That part is her fault.

307
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,101
The part where somebody
wasted his time in the basement,

308
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:43,014
plotting the overthrow of
a government agency, that one's on you.

309
00:16:43,098 --> 00:16:46,270
The only think I can do is think.
I can pretty much do that anywhere.

310
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:49,890
As long as no one's bugging me.

311
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,295
Rodney:
Did you call your brother?

312
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:55,075
No.

313
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:58,535
Did you?

314
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,034
No.

315
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,505
It's not a big deal.

316
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:07,639
I sure would have liked
to see Mom, though.

317
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:13,719
You know
she can't travel anymore.

318
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:16,354
You tell her?

319
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:19,358
Why?

320
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,200
Just upset her for a while.

321
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:28,790
Then she wouldn't
remember for a while.

322
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:35,483
Think she should know?

323
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:39,996
She's lost
a lot of who she was.

324
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:47,686
She can't deal
with something like this.

325
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,159
And you can?

326
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:58,654
I still know you're
going to a better place.

327
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:05,260
It's easy for you, isn't it?

328
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:12,113
As long as you believe
I'm going to a better place,
dying ain't so bad.

329
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:16,919
I don't want you to be afraid.

330
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:22,680
If I'm not afraid of dying,
what the hell should I be afraid of, Dad?

331
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:27,194
I thought you believed.

332
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,911
I did.

333
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,769
I'm not so sure anymore.

334
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,875
I'm going to
pray for you, son.

335
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:48,389
I suggest you do the same.

"One Safe Place"
by Marc Cohn

337
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:59,785
<i># How many roads you've traveled #</i>

338
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:06,455
<i># How many dreams you've chased #</i>

339
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:13,504
<i># Across sand and sky and gravel #</i>

340
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,618

00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:19,253

344
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:25,693

[Phone rings]

350
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,847
Chase:
Field of vision is regressing.

351
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,076
And he's reached an 8
on the pain scale.

352
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,462
The disease pattern is following
the exact course as Joe's.

353
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:46,344
Only it's moving much faster
in Foreman.

354
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:48,811
Good! It's an anomaly.

355
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,282
Anomalies tell us things.

356
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:52,629
Why is this moving faster
in Foreman? What's different?

357
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:54,425
Could be a different strain
of the same disease?

358
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,251
Right-- we were wasting all this time
looking for an unknown disease.

359
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:59,954
We should have been looking for
a different strain of an unknown disease.

360
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:03,734
Joe's a cop.
He's into physical fitness,
he could have had a...

361
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:06,288
more powerful immune system, stronger metabolism.

362
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:07,883
Foreman's black.

363
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:09,098
What?

364
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:10,819
How long have you been
sitting on this information?

365
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:15,326
Lupus,  gout, glaucoma,
osteoarthritis, hypertension,
diabetes, stop me any time,

366
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,212
they all affect black people
more than whites.

367
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,478
Check everything.

368
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:21,221
Bacterials, fungals,
toxins, parasites.

369
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:24,132
Look for anything with
a documented racial disparity.

370
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:28,606
Wait.

371
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:30,931
The rat's showing symptoms?

372
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:31,982
No.

373
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:34,519
He's completely healthy.

374
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:37,955
Maybe that's the difference
between Foreman and the cop.

375
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:44,345
How are you feeling?

376
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,159
Why are you here?

377
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:50,558
Because you're a friend.
And I should be here.

378
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm sorry House used my dad
to try and manipulate you.

379
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:04,142
You've got integrity, you aren't going
to change your mind just because
you're confronted by my father.

380
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:05,025
Thank you.

381
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:10,767
Just like I'm not going to forgive you
just because you come by here
and ask how I'm feeling.

382
00:21:10,851 --> 00:21:12,109
You know I've had no choice.

383
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,114
Of course
you had a choice!

384
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:15,880
Regulations are clear.

385
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,741
And the punishment for
violating those regulations!

386
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,391
Is it death? Hmm?

387
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:26,581
Because frankly, I'm okay
if you get a fine, a suspension--

388
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,495
Hell, you can spend
a couple of years in jail

389
00:21:29,562 --> 00:21:32,458
if it saves my life!

390
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,167
- You're dying too fast.
- Couldn't agree more.

391
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:39,004
Hey, Cuddy.
Having a nice visit?

392
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:41,748
What's that?

393
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,237
[Garbled]
Legionel--

394
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:45,329
Legionella pneumophila.

395
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:48,196
And why are you carrying
a vial of it around with you?

396
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:51,202
Foreman was perfectly healthy
before he got this infection.

397
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:53,926
Our cop wasn't.
He had Legionnaire's disease.

398
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:57,466
Our cop didn't turn into brain food
until we cured the Legionella.

399
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,165
Legionella
slowed down the disease.

400
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:04,229
- Why would that happen?
- No idea. I just know that it did.

401
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:07,574
- So you want to infect Foreman?
- Gonna tattle to the CDC?

402
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:10,120
Meds can't help me,
but a disease can?

403
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:12,764
Forget it!
Just take the pain away
and put me under.

404
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:15,585
If I put you under,
I can't monitor your pain.

405
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:18,566
If I can't monitor your pain,
I won't know if the Legionella's working.

406
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:20,350
I'm not consenting
to you giving me--

407
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:21,546
[Crash!]

408
00:22:22,153 --> 00:22:23,449
Foreman:
What was that?

409
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:24,750
House:
Hmm.

410
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,317
I wish there could have been
a puff of smoke or something.

411
00:22:27,374 --> 00:22:29,040
Would've been
much more dramatic.

412
00:22:30,193 --> 00:22:32,135
Keep your slippers on.

413
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,703
Wouldn't want you
to cut your foot.

414
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,730
Are you feeling any better?

415
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,484
I can't breathe.
I'm dizzy.

416
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:43,374
And I can barely hear anything
over the sounds of my lungs crackling.

417
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:46,013
- That's the Legionella.
- Wow.

418
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,242
You figure that out from the symptoms,
or from the vial of stuff tossed in my room?

419
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,089
I'm trying to be professional here.
There's no reason to be nasty.

420
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:53,036
I'm in pain.

421
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,970
- So is House.
- And he's a delight.

422
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:57,881
He doesn't try
to kill his colleagues.
[Thermometer bleeps]

423
00:22:57,974 --> 00:23:00,375
You can remove
the thermometer now.

424
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:08,994
It's down almost
a whole degree.

425
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,337
How's the pain?

426
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:13,311
Great. [Coughs]
This is the good kind.

427
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,741
How bad is it
compared to an hour ago?

428
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,548
No worse.

429
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:28,945
Wilson:
The Legionella helping?

430
00:23:31,414 --> 00:23:32,404
Yeah.

431
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:34,797
- Good.
- Not great.

432
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:37,241
Didn't fix anything,
it just slowed it down.

433
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:39,853
The point was to give Steve
a little more time to get sick.

434
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:42,353
What are you going to do
if he never gets sick?

435
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,339
Brilliant.

436
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:51,661
Cameron, what type of illnesses
affect humans, but not rats?

437
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:52,924
Why are you asking me that?

438
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:56,986
Because I'm sure that
you spent the first 12 years of your life
dreaming of being a vet.

439
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:58,521
The rat is not getting sick.

440
00:23:58,626 --> 00:23:59,955
Cameron is not getting sick.

441
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:00,643
Sorry.

442
00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:02,742
It's okay,
it's not your fault.

443
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:06,253
Presumably, you're still healthy
because whatever it is, is not bloodborne.

444
00:24:06,337 --> 00:24:08,667
Steve has no excuse.
He did everything that Foreman did.

445
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,965
Some bacterial infections
don't infect rats.

446
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:14,131
Foreman tested negative
for every bacterial infection
that would affect his brain.

447
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:18,542
And what infections
could he be positive for,
but test negative for?

448
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:22,808
When we test for infections,
we look for antibodies.

449
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:25,889
But what if the patient is infected,
but has no antibodies?

450
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:28,271
What if the body is
not fighting the infection?

451
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:30,957
- Why would--
- Eeeeh. I asked first.

452
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,999
Let's start with what,
we'll deal with the why later.

453
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:36,179
If the body doesn't recognize the infection,
our tests come back negative,

454
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:38,305
and the disease rampages
through the body unstopped.

455
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:41,345
Exactly like the cop
and exactly like Foreman.

456
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:44,202
And what if the patient was then
exposed to a second infection?

457
00:24:44,286 --> 00:24:45,210
Like Legionella?

458
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:49,581
The body would recognize that infection,
increase the white count,
send in the troops to start fighting,

459
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:52,345
and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire.

460
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:56,535
So the question becomes,
what type of bacteria infecition
affects humans but not rats,

461
00:24:56,604 --> 00:24:59,777
and the human body
would be unlikely to recognize?

462
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:02,535
The answer is listeria.

463
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:04,428
I'm starting you
on *Ampengent.
(*AMP and gent?)

464
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:09,265
So you're basing this theory
on the test being negative
and your rat being healthy?

465
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:11,461
And in fact that
Legionella is helping you.

466
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:15,015
But the medicine
you want to give me
put an end to that.

467
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:15,864
Yeah.

468
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:20,458
And if it's not listeria,
the gent will do is cure
the Legionnaire's disease

469
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:23,021
and put
whatever is killing me
back into overdrive.

470
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:26,993
Stop asking me questions based
on the premise that I'm wrong.

471
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:32,993
The antibiotics are in the airlock.

472
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:41,606
I think the first biopsy
didn't give us the answer
because you didn't go deep enough.

473
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:46,077
I want you to do
a white matter brain biopsy.

474
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,193
Absolutely.
Don't blame you.

475
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:51,361
The world is such a complicated place
if you've got higher reasoning skills.

476
00:25:51,445 --> 00:25:54,532
I'm often jealous of
small animals and retarded children.

477
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:56,364
Take the antibiotics.

478
00:25:56,448 --> 00:26:00,134
There can be minimal damage
if it's done right.

479
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:02,813
If the surgeons drill
where I tell them to drill.

480
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:06,996
One slip--
you could spend the rest of your life
not being able to keep your drool in your mouth.

481
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,700
I'd rather be disabled than dead.

482
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:11,141
Sure, I make it look oh so sexy.

483
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:13,177
It's actually not as glamorous
as you might think.

484
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:16,269
The biopsy will tell us
for sure what's wrong.

485
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:18,367
The antibiotics
could do the same thing.

486
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:20,916
- Could, not will.
- We try it, we see.

487
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,971
The antibiotics will
bring back the pain.

488
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:35,368
Pain makes us bad decisions.

489
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:41,603
Fear of pain...
is almost as big a motivator.

490
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:45,999
Look, we still have time.

491
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:49,454
I will do that biopsy
if I have to.

492
00:26:49,622 --> 00:26:51,884
But not a moment before.

493
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:12,504
Start Foreman
on I.V. antibiotics.

494
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:13,716
Where's his dad?

495
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:15,699
Where you supposed to be
when your son is dying?

496
00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:16,769
He's not with him.

497
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,671
He's in the chapel.

498
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:27,126
I started your son
on a new course of treatment.

499
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:30,446
If it works, he'll get better.

500
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:32,930
If it doesn't, he won't.

501
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,283
While he's not getting better,

502
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,958
he's going to experience so much pain

503
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:41,782
that will have to put him
on a chemically-induded coma

504
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:43,985
while we figure out what to do next.

505
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:47,123
My son says you're
a manipulative bastard.

506
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,231
It's a pet name.

507
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,396
I call him Dr. Bling.

508
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:55,686
I assume you're here for a reason.
What do you want from me?

509
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:59,082
When your son is in a coma,

510
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:02,745
you're the one who's gonna have to
make the medical decisions for him.

511
00:28:02,787 --> 00:28:05,201
Oh, whatever you decide is fine.

512
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,225
- You don't care what I do?
- I'm not a doctor. What do I know?

513
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,001
Except what Eric tells me.

514
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:18,017
He says you're the best doctor
he's ever worked with.

515
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:33,542
I need your help.

516
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:35,547
There's nothing
I can give you for the pain.

517
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,621
I want to be put out.

518
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:39,383
I can have a nurse in here
in 5 minutes.

519
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,289
No.

520
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:42,190
Want some help.

521
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,280
I might not come back.

522
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,353
I've never done a will.

523
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:51,106
I'll call a lawyer for you.

524
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:54,394
I want you to be
my medical proxy.

525
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,670
All the things that piss me off
about you in House's office--

526
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:02,569
you're too emotional,
too caring, too cautious--

527
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:05,407
they're all good things
on this floor.

528
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:09,143
- Your dad is--
- No.

529
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:11,726
- He cares about you.
- So do you.

530
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:13,567
I can't do this.

531
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:19,075
We expect family members
to make decisions about their loved ones

532
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:24,841
after a 10-minute briefing that
we're agonizing over even
with years of medical experience.

533
00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:27,614
That's from my article.

534
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:32,014
I'm sorry, Allison.

535
00:29:32,424 --> 00:29:36,205
I shouldn't have stolen your article.
I shouldn't have exposed you.

536
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:41,550
You were a friend.
I need to know that we're okay.

537
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:50,071
No.

538
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:53,542
I'll be your proxy,
but we're not okay.

539
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:59,878
You're scared you're dying.
and that's the only reason
you want to set things right.

540
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,475
We're going to
get you better first,

541
00:30:03,144 --> 00:30:04,599
and then,

542
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:08,414
if you still want to apologize,
I'll be around.

543
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:12,327
I'll call that lawyer.

544
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:28,756
Any improvement?

545
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:32,844
Well, as far as we can tell,
the only thing the antibiotics
are treating is the Legionella.

546
00:30:32,995 --> 00:30:35,337
I think we need to consider
alternate theories.

547
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:36,279
Like what?

548
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:39,450
- We do the biopsy. We--
- Give the antibiotics more time.

549
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:42,022
There is no more time.
The pain is almost unbearable already.

550
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:46,119
So he's almost in unbearable pain.
He's not almost dead.

551
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:49,079
Which means
we have more time.

552
00:30:57,724 --> 00:30:59,390
Mr. Foreman?

553
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:06,174
We need to
put your son in a coma.

554
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:09,859
You should be there.

555
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:13,067
It's a medical procedure, right?

556
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,754
Yeah.

557
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:19,780
But once we put him out,
if--if we don't solve this,

558
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:22,734
he won't wake up.

559
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,195
What should I say?

560
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,007
Should I talk to him
like it's going to be... okay?

561
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,479
Or should I be
saying good-bye?

562
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:40,252
I need... to know
what people say when--

563
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:42,674
Just tell him you love him.

564
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:07,491
Hey, son.

565
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:09,427
Hey, Dad.

566
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,636
It's going to be okay.

567
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:17,845
You don't know that.

568
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:23,222
I.. know.

569
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,469
You don't.

570
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:38,060
I don't want to miss you.

571
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,748
I love you too, Dad.

572
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:51,499
[Sobs quietly]

573
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,729
Hey.

574
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:56,722
It's going to be okay.

575
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,119
- Can we do this now?
- Yeah, of course.

576
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:18,330
I accept your apology.

577
00:33:24,744 --> 00:33:26,104
[Sniffles]

578
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:42,121
Why weren't you with Foreman?

579
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:46,640
I hang out in the basement, you rag on me.
I stay in my office, you rag on me.

580
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,734
- Honkey just can't buy a break.
- Do the biopsy.

581
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:53,414
Based on the cop's progression,
I figure he's got
about another 4 hours before--

582
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:54,963
You figure?

583
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:57,771
You're playing Russian roulette,
but the gun's pointed at him.

584
00:33:57,855 --> 00:34:00,603
No, cutting open his head
is what's dangerous.

585
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,462
Oh, it's dangerous.
Well, what would people think?

586
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:06,874
The reason you don't see patients is
because if you know them,
you'll give a crap about them.

587
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:07,526
I know you.

588
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,519
If you give a crap,
you stop making outrageous calls.

589
00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:14,280
If this was any other patient,
you'd have damned the risk and
cut their head open a long time ago.

590
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:16,755
He's out.
The EEG shows he's still in pain.

591
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:19,994
The antibiotics have had
more than enough time.
We're doing the brain biopsy.

592
00:34:20,078 --> 00:34:22,934
Not unless you people can't
come up with something clever
in the next 3 hours.

593
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:24,767
Now.
We're doing it now.

594
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:27,123
Who died and made you boss?

595
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:28,526
Foreman.

596
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:38,098
It's legal.

He's out of his mind.

598

Yesterday he was giggling
about a hole in a guy's head.

599
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:44,511
Then hire a lawyer
and challenge it.

600
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:46,354
In the meantime,
Cameron's in charge.

601
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,332
Why would he sign that?

602
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:49,963
It's nothing personal,
Mr. Foreman.

603
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:54,995
My son doesn't trust me.
How exactly is that not personal?

604
00:34:55,662 --> 00:34:57,233
I'm sorry.

605
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:58,541
You're sorry?

606
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,208
You're talking
about this man's son.

607
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:01,771
You're denying him the right
to be a part of--

608
00:35:01,855 --> 00:35:03,618
Oh, shut up, House.

609
00:35:04,212 --> 00:35:06,471
If you want to do the biopsy,
do the biopsy.

610
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:09,982
If House tries to interfere,
let me know and I will take care of it.

611
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:15,229
Yeah. You're a hero. If it wasn't for you,
we'd be cutting into a dead guy's head
instead of Foreman's.

612
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:18,986
Sorry.

613
00:35:19,862 --> 00:35:21,164
Thanks.

614
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,197
- That was great!
- It was rude and unnecessary.

615
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:28,038
- Yeah.
- Go away.

616
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,662
Give me time.

617
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:31,651
- We're out of time.
- An hour.

618
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:33,375
What does "out of time" mean?

His O2 stats are
94 right now.

620
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:38,175
His lungs are about 90.
The danger of fatal arrhythmia
doesn't increase.

621
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:39,955
So what?
There's no point in waiting.

622
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,486
You were right. We should be
cutting into a corpse's head.

623
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,532
Yeah, we should be,
except the CDC's got
the cop's body and--

624
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:48,630
There's got to be
other bodies.

625
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,639
You think this thing
has killed other people?

626
00:35:50,745 --> 00:35:51,680
No.

627
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:54,994
That apartment was a dump.

628
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,635
Just because Steve McQueen
didn't get sick doesn't mean
some other vermin didn't.

You give me an hour.
I go back there, I find a dead animal,
I cut its head open instead of Foreman's.

through this place.

and migrates into the brain,
where it feeds on brain cells.

00:40:36,325 --> 00:40:38,454
But the surgery?

672
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:42,846
We don't know.

673
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:56,116
# How many roads we've traveled #

674
00:40:58,835 --> 00:41:03,105
# How many dreams we've chased #

675
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,886
# Across sand and sky and gravel #

676
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:13,696
# But looking for one safe place #

677
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,088
# Yeah #

678
00:41:15,418 --> 00:41:17,608
# Hey yeah #

679
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:20,316
# One safe place #

680
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:21,611
# Yeah #

681
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,600
# Hey yeah  #

682
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,507
Up and at 'em.

683
00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:30,880
How are you feeling?

684
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,704
Can you talk?

685
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,135
I don't feel anything.

686
00:41:39,616 --> 00:41:41,457
Are you numb?

687
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:43,366
No, I--

688
00:41:43,857 --> 00:41:47,535
I mean...
I don't feel any pain.

689
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:53,573
Keep your head still.
Follow my finger.

690
00:41:57,212 --> 00:41:58,242
I'm okay.

691
00:41:58,312 --> 00:42:01,329
Your breath stinks.
And you're peeing into a bag.

692
00:42:01,544 --> 00:42:03,692
What are our names?

693
00:42:05,297 --> 00:42:07,674
You did the biopsy?

694
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,523
Thank you.

695
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:12,067
Names?

696
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,695
Cameron.

697
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:16,486
My dad.

698
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,821
And the manipulative bastard.

699
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:20,232
You remembered.

700
00:42:20,401 --> 00:42:21,653
[Laughs tearfully]

701
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,584
How you doing, Dad?

702
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:24,994
Great.

703
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:28,469
Relieved. Great.

704
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:31,215
What did I have?

705
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,019
Naegleria.

706
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:34,813
Biopsy showed the amoeba.

707
00:42:34,897 --> 00:42:36,851
CDC autopsy eventually
found the amoeba.

708
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:40,031
And House found it
in the water on the cop's roof.

709
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:41,903
Wiggle your left toes.

710
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:43,485
Foreman:
Wait, wait.

711
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:46,420
You went back and
she did the biopsy?

712
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,381
Your left toes, Foreman.

713
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:51,352
I just did.

714
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:55,021
No, you didn't.

715
00:42:56,505 --> 00:42:57,688
He can't move his toes?

716
00:42:57,797 --> 00:42:59,190
He can move them.

717
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:01,500
Raise your right arm.

718
00:43:04,105 --> 00:43:05,324
What?

00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:08,417
