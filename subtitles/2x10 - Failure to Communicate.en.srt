1
00:00:02,786 --> 00:00:10,568
So there I am, on my 25th birthday,
driving from Wheeling, West Virginia
to Bensonhurst in a Dodge Dart with no radio

2
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:13,014
and a gun runner
named Barrelhead,

3
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:16,950
[Laughter (o<)]
who insisted we sing
every Jimmy Buffet song he could recall.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,006
What can I say?
The man was heavily armed. [(o<)]

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,630
So 500 renditions of
Margaritaville later,

6
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:30,446
my first cover, 8,000 words on
how Barrelhead and his friends were
transporting handguns for sale to New York city.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,644
The day the magazine hit the stands,
the D.A. hit me with a subpoena.

8
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:36,085
He wanted to know
Barrelhead's real name.

9
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:39,504
Greta had been managing editor
for three whole days.

10
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:44,564
So she invited me
across the street to the fancy bar,
where they use real glasses. [(o<)]

11
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:47,576
And after about the sixth
vodka and tonic,

12
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:50,697
she said,
"Fletch, I want you to know
the magazine is behind you."

13
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:52,486
Well, I was impressed.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,528
I said,  "Do you think
you can get the DA off my back?"

15
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,001
And she said,
"No. But when you get out of jail,
you'll still have a job." [(o<)]

16
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:05,502
I'm 45. I've given up a lot.
I've given up the road, that life.

17
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:09,120
Thanks,  Elizabeth.
No regrets. My lovely wife.

18
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:11,915
I've given up drinking.
I've given up drugs.

19
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:14,481
Greta taught me there's
two things you never give up.

20
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:16,849
One's rock and roll.
The other's a source.

21
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,125
Greta Sims.

22
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,601
[Cheers and applause]

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,578
Great memories, Greta.

24
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:20,633
We'll miss you, Greta.

25
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:21,565
We'll miss you.

26
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:24,319
I only hope you can adjust
to the lack of stress in your...

27
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,163
Fletch!

28
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:28,668
Fletch!

29
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:30,786
Fletcher.

30
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:32,918
Fletch.

31
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:34,744
Fletcher.

32
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:35,835
Fletcher!

33
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:38,600
Honey, sweetie.
Are you okay?

34
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,406
Oh!

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,317
Are you okay?

36
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,569
I flung the investment.

37
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:52,303
[Laughter]
What did you say?

38
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:00,952
I flung the investment.

39
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:04,404
Why consign?

40
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,909
Why consign?

41
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,813
I'll call 911.

42
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,970
It's proficient.

43
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:21,388
Why disqualify the rush?
I'm tabled.

44
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:25,839
I'm tabled.

45
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:31,473
2x10 - Failure to Communicate

46
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:56,834
Original Airdate (FOX): 10 JAN-2006

47
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,320
[Whistles]

48
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,830
I need your advice.

49
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:15,650
What's the best diagnostics department
within 60 miles of here?

50
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:16,831
We are.

51
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,163
"We" aren't here.

52
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:20,608
House is in Baltimore lying
to Medicaid about his billings.

53
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:24,384
- So? I'm board certified.
- You are not House.

54
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:27,417
Why'd you put me
in charge of the department
if you think I can't handle it?

55
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:30,662
Because it's temporary,
and because I was ordered to.

56
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,503
- What are the symptoms?
- Oh, come on.

57
00:03:35,503 --> 00:03:37,562
You're gonna diagnose him
without meeting him?

58
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:40,381
Prove that you're
as brilliant as House?

59
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:44,094
I need to know the symptoms to
know which hospital to recommend.

60
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:49,297
EMT's report...
patient struck his head
and is suffering from aphasia.

61
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,880
Hmm, neurological problem.

62
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,972
You know, I know a lot of
good people in that field seeing
as I happen to be a neurologist.

63
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,788
- You're pouting.
- Not at all.

64
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,099
Taylor's pretty good.

65
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,492
House was ready to hire him
till he got my resume.

66
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:06,121
It's Fletcher Stone.

67
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:09,488
Wrote 12 books.
Exposed three administrations.

68
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,149
- Before he exposes us...
- I get it. Famous patient needs
famous doctor.

69
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:16,086
- I'll call Taylor.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,882
Or maybe you should call him.

71
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,179
What if I say something stupid?

72
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:25,433
Oh, God.

73
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:27,435
House is easier.

74
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:36,527
Have you been taking any drugs?

75
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,970
I displaced my function.
Accolade.

76
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:44,709
He used to drink regularly,
but he's been clean and sober
for nearly a year.

77
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:49,312
Mr. Stone, you think
you're speaking normally,
but your speech is impaired.

78
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:54,363
He knows what he wants to say,
but when he reaches for a word,
he finds something else.

79
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:57,345
I grapple average.

80
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:00,186
Tanzer glisten.

81
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:03,010
He doesn't know
that he's saying it wrong?

82
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,544
It all sounds right to him.

83
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:09,590
I want you to write
your name and draw a face.

84
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:29,621
It's called agraphia.
Loss of ability to write.
Most often it's temporary.

85
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,430
How hard did he hit his head?

86
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:35,548
It was a pretty good crack.
It made a really ugly sound.

87
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,079
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

88
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:38,652
Of golf.

89
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:41,991
Don't give me a sentence.
Just say yes or a no.

90
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,416
You understand me?

91
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,161
Yes.

92
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:50,078
Elizabeth. Fletch.

93
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,378
Is he okay?

94
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:54,668
We  don't know.
This is Fletch's editor.

95
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,716
Greta Sims.
I wanted to make sure that
the EMTs told you the right story.

96
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:00,224
How many stories are there?

97
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:01,582
He didn't trip.

98
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,981
He just fell.
Out of the blue.

99
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:07,798
His foot jerked a little bit first.
That's what made it look like a trip.

100
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,076
Stacy:
Don't say anything.

101
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,874
Don't attempt to defend
your billing practices.

102
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,615
Your billing practices
are indefensible.

103
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:20,927
We've  been over this.

104
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,376
If I thought you were capable
of listening, I'd shut up.

105
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,404
That makes no sense at all.

106
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:34,252
- [Sighs] Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

107
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,389
Every case you have rates a five
on the complexity scale?

108
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:47,771
Dr. House has a rather
specialized practice.

109
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,828
Ah. Okay.

110
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:54,048
Then let's go through these.

111
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:55,808
All of these?

112
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,128
If you have lunch reservations,
cancel them.

113
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:02,299
All right. Patient...

114
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,436
If he didn't trip,
something made him fall.

115
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,186
Stoke? Seizure?

116
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,978
30  people saw him trip.
One person says he didn't.
Who you gonna believe?

117
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:14,117
His symptoms can all be
explained by the head trauma.

118
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:17,164
Causes a contusion or a seizure.
That causes the aphasia.

119
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:18,225
We should get an EEG.

120
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,899
If it was a stroke,
it could be a clotting issue.

121
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,603
Even if he fell,
drug use is far more likely.

122
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:23,946
I'm ordering a tox screen.

123
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,304
Chase, we're not done
with the differential.

124
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:28,432
You're not my boss.

125
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,555
I'm House's boss.
House is your boss.

126
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,820
The math is pretty simple.

127
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:36,064
Are you signing my paychecks?
Are you hiring or firing?

128
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,141
This is not about that...

129
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:41,542
The only thing you've been
asked to do is supervise House
in case he doessomething insane.

130
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,261
Which might,
you know, save a life.

131
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:47,601
- Somebody's gotta be in charge.
- Why?

132
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:49,808
You think we should all just do
whatever we wanna do?

133
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:51,307
Maybe have a race
to the diagnosis.

134
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:54,943
I think it should be
a discussion among peers.

135
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,826
I think we're grown up enough
to reach a consensus.

136
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:06,631
Patient, 62 years old.
You prescribed Viagra.

137
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,018
I look in vain for the words
erectile dysfunction in the notes
for Delores Smith.

138
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:15,084
She had a heart condition.

139
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,066
And you ran out
of nitroglycerin?

140
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,288
She also had low blood pressure.

141
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,480
So nitro would be dangerous.

142
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:24,074
Little blue pills
improve blood flow.

143
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:25,704
They're vasodilators.

144
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,811
It's why you sometimes
get the headaches.

145
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,252
Stacy:
I think Dr. House understands.

146
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:30,291
House:
Oh, of course I do.

147
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,331
The woman has a heart condition
she's on her own.

148
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:36,591
A man can't nail his office assistant,
it's national crisis time.

149
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:40,656
Are you seriously expecting us
to foot the bill for
off-label use of medication?

150
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,397
Fine. I'll pay for it.

151
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:45,672
How much are the pills?
She took how many?

152
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:47,320
Put the money away.

153
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:50,034
- Are you trying to bribe me?
- No.

154
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:53,082
I could.
There's an ATM in the lobby.

155
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,735
My client's an idiot.

156
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,471
But is he wrong
about the pills?

157
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,160
Off-label use
is not sanctioned.

158
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:04,141
You're retiring
in three weeks.

159
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,226
You've been doing this job
nearly 20 years.

160
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,860
Aren't you tired of
administering policy
you disagree with?

161
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,525
- I-I never said I disagree.
- What can they do to you?

162
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:17,552
And Dr. House is sorry
about his earlier outburst.

163
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:19,412
Absolutely.

164
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:28,081
You do background checks
on Medicaid personnel?

165
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,839
I do what's necessary
for my client.

166
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:33,702
- Wow, new personal record.
- Yeah, timing's good for me too.

167
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,994
I got a reservation
at a little place in the Inner Harbor.

168
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,450
- You booked us dinner reservations?
- Best Maryland crab in...Maryland.

169
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:44,217
- Don't you have a plane to catch?
- Not for hours.

170
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:46,386
Your flight leaves at 7:00.

171
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:49,427
You did a background check on me?

172
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:51,128
And mine doesn't leave till 9:00pm.

173
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:52,870
It looks like
you'll be dining alone.

174
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:54,863
You checked on my flight

175
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:57,558
so you could be sure
to be on a different one.

176
00:09:57,903 --> 00:10:00,360
I thought we were past
the avoidance stage.

177
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:03,377
I didn't think
we'd be finished this soon.

178
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,488
Where's your crucifix?

179
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,721
I left it at the jewelers
to be cleaned.

180
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:12,846
Right.

181
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:21,177
This will show us if there's
a problem with your carotid artery
that might cause a blood clot.

182
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:25,344
If it went to his brain,
that could explain the aphasia
and the falling down.

183
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:28,199
And you're giving him an EEG?
Is that for the same thing?

184
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:29,866
Uh, it's just a precaution.

185
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:34,728
I think the trauma caused some swelling,
and we need to keep him stable
until the bodycan repair the damage.

186
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:36,759
And you think
they're both wrong?

187
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,726
Foreman:
We're just covering all the bases.

188
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:42,929
- Being safe.
- [Chokes and coughs]
[Monitors start beeping]

189
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,040
His O2 sats are going down.

190
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,271
[Continues coughing]

191
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:54,053
- Fluid in his lungs.
- Push 40 IV Lasix.

192
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,060
- We need to intubate.
- He's losing his respiratory drive.

193
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,194
Now put him down.

194
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:26,067
Foreman:
And then there were two.

195
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,060
Aphasia and fluid in the lungs.

196
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:29,521
Seizure can't cause both.

197
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:30,860
Neither can a stroke.

198
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:32,601
Unless he had
an abnormal heart rhythm.

199
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:34,502
Chase:
And then there was one.

200
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:37,053
Urine test is positive
for amphetamines.

201
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:39,118
Amphetamines don't cause
pulmonary edema.

202
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:40,863
They doif you smoke 'em.

203
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:45,918
In one of his books he talked
about giving updrugs and alcohol,
how it changed his life.

204
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,230
Everybody lies.

205
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:54,608
When he started wanting to hear
every minute of my day,

206
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:57,415
it should have been a clue
he was the jealous type.

207
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,482
But you know,
in that first stage
of a relationship,

208
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:06,156
where it's like your body's full of
these chemicals that make you think
everything they do is charming...

209
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:08,815
[Cell phone rings]
Ah.

210
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:10,867
Excuse me.

211
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,783
Wilson: <i>Hello?</i>

212
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:16,049
Hey, honey, how are the kids?
They miss me?

213
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:18,888
This may take a minute.

214
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,452
House:
<i>So what's new with Mr. Aphasia.</i>

215
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:22,923
Cuddy called you?

216
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:25,599
Everybody covers their ass.

217
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:26,753
Wilson:
<i>Pulmonary edema.</i>

218
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:29,516
Chase did a tox screen.
It came back positive
for amphetamines.

219
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,059
He did the dance of victory.

220
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:33,170
I'm betting
there's another shoe.

221
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,899
I thought
the kids didn't call you.

222
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:36,022
[Thump!]

223
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,089
I know the way
you tell stories.

224
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:44,734
Foreman went to talk to Stone
about his drug test, found him
running a temperature.

225
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:46,822
So it's not the drugs.

226
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,263
They've just got such a bad rep.
[Thump!]

227
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:54,330
Mother:
Honey, you shouldn't do that.

228
00:12:54,414 --> 00:12:55,841
Okay, I gotta hang up.

229
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:57,303
They're probably trying
to reach me.

230
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:59,920
- You don't have call waiting?
- I'm hanging up on you now.

231
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:01,775
Wilson:
<i>It's $5.00 a month.</i>

232
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,634
[Thump!]

233
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:11,174
Drugs don't cause fever.

234
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:15,117
Encephalitis or meningitis
are the obvious suspects.
Start him on antibiotics.

235
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:18,313
It could be
an autoimmune disease.
Lupus, Behcet's.

236
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,537
We could start himon a high dose of steroids.

237
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:24,389
[Phone ringing]
Except if he does have encephalitis,
steroids could weaken his immune system.

238
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,684
Foreman.

239
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:27,331
How high a fever?

240
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:30,918
Put me on speaker phone.
And why haven't you called me?

241
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:33,557
101.
How'd you know?

242
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:38,551
What? You think you guys can
have a party as soon as the parents
are gone, and I won't hear about it?

243
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,429
House:
<i>Start with broad spectrum antibiotics
for possible bacterial meningitis</i>

244
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,653
and an antiviral in case we luck out,
and it's herpes encephalitis.

245
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,101
What if it's autoimmune?

246
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:48,679
Well, then we're screwed.

247
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:51,176
Which is why we need
more information.

248
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,070
Any genetic issuewith the family?

249
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,578
Foreman:
<i>The man can't talk.</i>

250
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:57,770
<i>His medical records are sketchy.
And the wife's only known him
a couple of years.</i>

251
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,030
House:
<i>MRI show anything?</i>

252
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:01,021
CT scan was negative.

253
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:02,439
CT?

254
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:04,833
That's, like,
short for MRI, right?

255
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,013
<i>Excellent.
That'll save us a lot of time.</i>

256
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:09,121
We've got an MRI
scheduled in 20 minutes.

257
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:11,086
Earliest Foreman
could get the machine.

258
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,913
I teach you to lie,
cheat, and steal,

259
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:16,652
and as soon as my back
is turned you wait in line?

260
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:20,019
Get an MRI, and get
a better medical history.

261
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:21,558
The man can't talk.

262
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:24,061
Who cares?
He's probably gonna lie anyway.

263
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,995
My flight's a little late.
I'll be back in a few hours.

264
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:32,333
So you're in charge of us
because you're in charge of him?

265
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:42,264
Any family history
of neurological problems?

266
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:43,573
No.

267
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,532
You've been out of the country
in the last five years.

268
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,772
Yes.

269
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,558
Three years?

270
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:53,093
Yes.

271
00:14:53,177 --> 00:14:54,397
Two years.

272
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:59,042
He stopped traveling for work
two years ago after we got serious.

273
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,525
Any vacations?

274
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,244
His  last one was
six months ago.

275
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:06,203
It was a golf resort
at Key Biscayne.

276
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,187
No way it was
a golf resort.

277
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:12,285
Knowing Fletch, I assume
he was working his way
through every bar in the Keys.

278
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,586
Last hurrah
before settling down.

279
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:16,993
[Elevator dings]
- Alcohol?
- No.

280
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:19,965
- Amphetamines.
- No.

281
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:22,091
You tested positive.

282
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:26,387
Elizabeth:
He doesn't use drugs.
I told you.

283
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:32,373
When we got engaged,
we decided we wanted
a different kind of life.

284
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:36,985
And he dropped the macho journalism.
No more taking crazy chances.

285
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,580
That includes his health.

286
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:41,608
He asked me not to tell Elizabeth.

287
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:43,931
He's been lying to herabout his drug habit?

288
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:46,287
Well, yes and no.

289
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:50,602
BE...before Elizabeth...
he used drugs recreationally.

290
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:51,976
I wasn't crazy about it,

291
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,013
but that thrill-seeking behavior
is what made him the kind
of journalist that he was.

292
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:58,484
And now, AE?

293
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,376
The man's twisted himself
into knots for her.

294
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:04,049
- Completely cleaned up his act.
- But the drugs?

295
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,776
They're medicinal.
Sort of.

296
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,837
He was having trouble sleeping.

297
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:10,882
His  new suburban lifestyle.

298
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,351
Lack of excitement
was throwing him off.

299
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:15,263
So he started
with sleeping pills.

300
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:19,598
When they knocked him out,
he needed something to
perk him back up during the day.

301
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:21,248
Chase:
Every day?

302
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,150
No slippery slope there.

303
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,205
Keep the stain.
Knife can't force.

304
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,935
We're not gonna tell your wife.

305
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:37,052
We're not cops.

306
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,976
There's a little edema.
Brain swelling.

307
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,809
And an area of scarring.

308
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,681
Is that what's
causing the aphasia?

309
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:57,280
Actually, that's what's odd.

310
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:01,147
The scarring's not in the area of
the brain normally associated
with conduction aphasia.

311
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:03,828
And it's old.
Happened before he hit his head.

312
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:08,040
Maybe a small stroke or
some other underlying condition
that could be causing this, or

313
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:10,030
it might have nothing
to do with it at all.

314
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:13,276
Have you ever had
head trauma before?

315
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:15,140
- An accident?
- Uh-uh.

316
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,877
You ever had any numbness
on one side before?

317
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,656
- Dizziness?
- What is the durable?

318
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:22,399
[Softly] Shh...

319
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:25,417
No.

320
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,483
Announcement:
<i>Boarding passengers
for flight number 870.</i>

321
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,959
<i>The plane will be delayed
by one half-hour. We apologize...</i>

322
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,156
Thanks.

323
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,412
Got you some coffee.

324
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:31,150
So...what do you
wanna talk about?

325
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:43,962
The scarring on the MRI
could be anything.

326
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:47,503
MS,  toxins, any one of a hundred demyelinating diseases.

327
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:50,438
If it's meningitis,
we have to ID the bug fast.

328
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:51,829
We need to do
a lumbar puncture.

329
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:53,914
I'm not doin LP
with this edema.

330
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:55,659
- We could paralyze him.
- What does House say?

331
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,036
"The person you're trying
to reach is out of the area or
has turned off their phone."

332
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,451
So what are your orders?

333
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:03,441
- We need more information.
- There is no more information.

334
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,867
We'll break into his place.

335
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,890
Have fun.

336
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,170
How's the patient?

337
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:16,094
Fine.

338
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:17,752
- Where you going?
Foreman: - Dinner.

339
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:20,109
Oh, well I'll join you.
You can bring me up to speed.

340
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:22,237
Sorry.
Reservation for two.

341
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:29,563
When people
give themselves away,
it's by little things.

342
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:32,599
That woman over there,

343
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:37,221
she's not sneering at her coffee.
She's recovering from Bell's Palsy.

344
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:45,009
The cashier at the coffee place,
she doesn't want anyone to know,
but she's dying of ALS.

345
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:49,631
There's a particular
sort of twitchy stiff arm
that's characteristic.

346
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,556
And then there's you.

347
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:55,568
Why aren't you
wearing your cross?

348
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,544
I told you, I left it at...

349
00:19:57,545 --> 00:20:01,849
You keep jewelry cleaner
under the sink so you won't
have to go a day without it.

350
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:06,614
True, you forgot it
that morning the pipes burst.

351
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:10,794
But then you went back
and waded through the flood
to retrieve it.

352
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:14,430
So...why no wading today?

353
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,090
Didn't you bring a book
to read or something?

354
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:27,077
Nothing.

355
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:36,455
Caffeine pills and amphetamines.
Same stuff he told us he was taking.

356
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:39,675
And Topamax.

357
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,177
An anti-convulsant?

358
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,158
He said there was
no history of prior seizure.

359
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,755
It's not even prescribed to him.

360
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,022
Still doesn't explain his fever.
Probably just using it for weight loss.

361
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:52,773
Just gives us another lie.
He must really be devoted.

362
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:53,854
Should we check the home?

363
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:57,145
If he wanted to hide something
from his wife, why wouldn't
he hide it in the office?

364
00:20:57,229 --> 00:20:59,248
Maybe she's
hiding something.

365
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:10,589
Nothing but aspirin and
flu meds in the bathroom.

366
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:15,393
Looks like this stuff's
been sitting here for weeks.

367
00:21:15,498 --> 00:21:16,996
Chase:
Hmm, home improvement.

368
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,092
He probably thought
he could take the project on,

369
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:21,976
then realized it was a little
more than he could handle.

370
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:27,231
You got a point to make, or did you just feel
like giving a long, unnecessary explanation
for something medically irrelevant?

371
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:29,329
What happened to the Foreman
who always has an answer?

372
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,599
The guy who practically
wears a sign saying,

373
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:33,958
"I'm as good as House,
but I'm nicer."

374
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:34,770
I never said that.

375
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:38,125
I guess it's safe to be confident
when House is there to overrule you.

376
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:40,035
Now that it's all on you?

377
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,069
It's different. Yeah.

378
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,123
Announcement:
<i>Flight 106 to Nashville
has been delayed...</i>

379
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:52,435
Either you left it behind
on purpose or by mistake.

380
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,665
The only reason you'd leave it
behind intentionally is
if it no longer meant anything to you.

381
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,517
But since it was
a gift from your mom,

382
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,020
that would mean
you had a fight with her.

383
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:02,473
And since you don't talk
to ghosts, that's unlikely.

384
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:05,580
- Leave it alone, Greg.
- Yeah, I'm good at that.

385
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:08,901
So that leaves
forgetting it unintentionally.

386
00:22:09,332 --> 00:22:11,888
But then we have to explain
why you didn't go back for it
when you realized.

387
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:13,787
I didn't realize
until I got to the airport.

388
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,638
Nope, you were wearing makeup
when you got to the airport.

389
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:18,962
You can't put on makeup
without looking at yourself.

390
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:21,173
You can't look at yourself
without touching that thing.

391
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,059
Why does this matter to you?

392
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:28,039
It's an anomaly.
Anomalies bug me.

393
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:32,301
Then you're gonna suffer.

394
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:44,549
[Groans in pain]

395
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,138
I think it's his stomach.

396
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:49,542
I teal indigent.

397
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:51,236
Is it something you ate?

398
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,645
He keeps doing that.

399
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:56,096
I teal indigent.

400
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:57,433
- Are you hungry?
- No.

401
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,328
- He's in pain. Is it a sharp pain?
- No!

402
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:02,821
Teal indigent!

403
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:04,496
- Taste?
- Yes!

404
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:07,974
- Uh, metallic taste?
- Yes!

405
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,758
I'll be right back.

406
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,759
Ow!

407
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:14,434
<i>Attention, passengers, flight 118...</i>

408
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,973
House:
I suppose it's also possible
that the clasp broke.

409
00:23:18,806 --> 00:23:20,950
But then you'd be carrying
the thing around in your purse.

410
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:22,391
We had a fight.

411
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:24,970
We had a fight, and I was angry
and not thinking straight.

412
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:27,165
And I walked out
without my makeup
and without my cross.

413
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:29,866
And I stopped at
the drugstore to buy makeup,
but I couldn't buy a cross

414
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:33,133
because they don't have an aisle
for personal talismans!

415
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,672
So you had a fight.
I'm sure it'll blow over.

416
00:23:39,756 --> 00:23:41,744
- It was about nothing.
- Of course it was.

417
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,000
Mark's tired. He's worried.
He's got mobility problems.

418
00:23:46,098 --> 00:23:47,954
It's normal to blow up
over little things.

419
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:52,005
I don't mind fighting over little things.
And I don't mind fighting over big things.

420
00:23:52,107 --> 00:23:55,706
That I could understand.
But we fight over nothing.

421
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:59,167
You know, a mailbox with a sign
that says "Last pickup 5:00 p.m."

422
00:23:59,252 --> 00:24:05,333
Does that mean last pickup to go to
the post office or last pickup to leave
the post office and be sent out of town?

423
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:08,080
You fought over mail delivery?

424
00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:10,908
I tried to get him to drop
the subject, but he wouldn't.

425
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:13,408
I told him he was right,
he thought I was
being condescending.

426
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:14,865
You were.

427
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:18,225
He's pushing me
out of his life.

428
00:24:18,868 --> 00:24:21,065
Or maybe you're
misinterpreting.

429
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,913
Did I misinterpret with you?

430
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:27,827
At least this time
I recognize it.

431
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:30,693
That's the benefit of
convincing the only two men
you've ever loved,

432
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:32,693
they're better off without you.

433
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:37,811
Yeah. It's all your fault.

434
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:41,863
You know,
"Stacy" in the original Greek
means relationship killer.

435
00:24:52,318 --> 00:24:56,799
I'm gonna go wash my face
so I look like a grown-up again.

436
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:03,794
[Phone rings]
Hello.

437
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,531
It's for you.

438
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:10,280
House.

439
00:25:10,364 --> 00:25:11,668
Do you know
your phone's dead?

440
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:13,114
Do you ever recharge
your batteries?

441
00:25:13,198 --> 00:25:14,347
House:
<i>They recharge?</i>

442
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,196
I just keep
buying new phones.

443
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:19,569
I thought you should know
your aphasia guy is tasting metal.

444
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,820
Where's his creatinine?

445
00:25:20,904 --> 00:25:22,754
<i>6.8. He's got kidney failure.</i>

446
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:26,009
Cameron's got him on dialysis,
and he's stable for the moment.

447
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:28,216
Unlike Cuddy, who's suicidal.

448
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:30,808
It's either meningitis
or encephalitis.

449
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:32,838
Or maybe autoimmune.

450
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:36,476
That's perfect.
Seems like you really
narrowed it down over dinner.

451
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:39,698
Here's the plan.
We talk to House...

452
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:41,445
Been trying.
He's not answering his cell.

453
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:43,415
It's obvious we have
to do the lumbar puncture.

454
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:45,977
There's no choice anymore.
[Phone ringing]

455
00:25:47,985 --> 00:25:49,209
House:
<i>You have to do it just right.</i>

456
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:50,617
What are you talking about?

457
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:53,122
Either you've decided
to do a lumbar puncture,

458
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:58,093
or you have to fire me
so that I can't fire all of you
as soon as I get back in charge.

459
00:25:58,315 --> 00:25:59,889
Is Cuddy there ranting?

460
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:01,880
If I'd known
you'd be out of contact...

461
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:02,777
They can handle it.

462
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:06,167
Right, so far only
three organ systems have failed.

463
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:08,135
<i>Okay, they can't.
Doesn't matter.</i>

464
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,761
The guy's not stable
enough to move.

465
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:11,784
So go rant in your own office.

466
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,198
Fine. Call me
when you're done.

467
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:22,567
What do you mean by
doing the LP just right?
We're not gonna screw it up.

468
00:26:22,651 --> 00:26:24,938
The odds are this guy
knows something we don't.

469
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:28,724
He could know the answer
to the meaning of life.
The man can't communicate.

470
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:32,375
<i>Have you had any indication
that he's tried to communicate
something important?</i>

471
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:33,636
No.

472
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:35,969
That's because you guys
haven't scared him enough.

473
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:38,719
I'm sure you've been all,
"We'll take realgood care of you."

474
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,169
<i>Why should he say anything?</i>

475
00:26:40,253 --> 00:26:42,562
When you prep him,
tell him he's gonna die.

476
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:46,730
<i>Crush all hope.
Don't let Cameron do it.</i>

477
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:48,789
Cuddy.

478
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:51,411
You got a problem
with any of that?

479
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:57,378
You're scheduled
for a lumbar puncture.

480
00:26:57,435 --> 00:26:59,961
But you shouldn't count on
that having the answers.

481
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:02,737
If your husband
continues to decline...

482
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:06,046
You'll die.

483
00:27:10,044 --> 00:27:12,854
If there's anything
you haven't told us...

484
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:32,375
How you holding up?

485
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:39,792
I know what you just heard
is scary as hell, but...

486
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:44,068
Couldn't tackle the bear.

487
00:27:44,902 --> 00:27:47,497
Couldn't tackle the bear.

488
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,731
They took my stain.

489
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:55,445
<i>Your attention please,
due to the weather conditions,</i>

490
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:58,624
<i>all flights are grounded
until further notice.</i>

491
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:57,790
Oh...

492
00:27:57,869 --> 00:27:59,037
You gotta be kiding.

493
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:01,426
<i>Cots are being provided
on the lower level.</i>

494
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,409
<i>We apologize
for the inconvenience.</i>

495
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:04,837
I don't believee it.

496
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:09,355
You want me to run down and
reserve you a cot with a view?

497
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,517
Where's your knapsack?

498
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:12,882
I checked it through.

499
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,583
Oh, that's right,
I forget it's hard for you
to carry and walk.

500
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,318
I booked a room at the airport hotel
when I saw how bad the weather was.

501
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:22,262
It's the last one available.

502
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:26,727
Your leg can't handle
a night on a cot.

503
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:28,759
Thanks.

504
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,976
I'm ready.

505
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,034
Right.

506
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:36,435
Hotel's upstairs.

507
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:40,721
Does Mark know about this?

508
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:44,568
Mark knows when things are bad,
I always like to have
an escape route planned.

509
00:29:08,523 --> 00:29:12,136
[Sighs] I have to know
what's going on here.

510
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:19,977
When you have a fight with Mark
and you try to avoid me,
I have to think that...

511
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:24,813
That I'm feeling vulnerable and
I don't wanna be around you
because it might lead to something.

512
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:26,063
Right.

513
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:29,475
But then a hotel room...

514
00:29:30,275 --> 00:29:32,552
Might also lead to something.

515
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,356
Hmm.

516
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,861
So which is it?

517
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:45,784
Our relationship's
like an addiction. It's... like...

518
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,721
Really good drugs?

519
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:51,996
No, it's like vindaloo curry.

520
00:29:52,185 --> 00:29:53,841
Okay, sure.

521
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,059
Really, really hot Indian curry
they make with red chili peppers.

522
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:58,810
I know what it is.

523
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,026
I didn't think
it was addictive.

524
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,330
You're abrasive and annoying and
come on way too strong, like...

525
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,367
vindaloo curry.
When you're crazy about curry,
that's fine. But

526
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:14,288
no matter how much you love curry,
you have too much of it, it takes
the roof of your mouth off.

527
00:30:14,372 --> 00:30:17,608
And then you never wanna see curry
for a really, really long time.

528
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:20,075
But you wake up
one day and you think...

529
00:30:23,097 --> 00:30:25,780
God, I really miss curry.

530
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:43,650
You're a jerk.

531
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:45,517
I know.

532
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:13,404
If you hadn't just had
a fight with Mark...

533
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:17,056
For once in your life,
will you shut up?

534
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:25,564
[Phone ringing]
Oh!

535
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,387
<i>House.</i>

536
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,332
You're on speaker phone.

537
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,648
How did the LP go?

538
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,252
Give me the Reader's Digest
condensed version.

539
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:47,808
Preliminary results are
some kind of infection
which...narrows it down.

540
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:50,138
From infinity. Yeah.

541
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:54,129
At the rate
his organs are deteriorating
he's got maybe a day or two.

542
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:57,815
Okay, well, call me back
when you have something.

543
00:31:58,025 --> 00:32:00,434
Cameron:
<i>He was trying to
tell us something.</i>

544
00:32:07,252 --> 00:32:08,471
What did he say?

545
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:10,495
You were wrong.
It wasn't the fear.

546
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:15,805
- He opened up to me when I...
- Sympathetic presence
after a traumatic moment.

547
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:19,342
Classic interrogation technique.
What did he say?

548
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:21,849
- You knew that I'd...
- <i>Act the way you always do?</i>

549
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:24,508
Yeah, I did.
What did he say?

550
00:32:25,095 --> 00:32:27,322
He couldn't tackle the bear.

551
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:30,514
Now all we need is
the English-Aphasiac dictionary.

552
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,769
A fluent aphasiac retrieves words
that are stored somewhere
close to the one he wants.

553
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:37,873
They can be filed
by sound or by meaning.

554
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:43,030
So if he wants to say table,
he could say label,
or he could say chair,

555
00:32:43,218 --> 00:32:46,141
or he could just say jabberwocky.
There's no way to tell.

556
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:49,894
<i>He also said,</i>
"They took my stain."

557
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:52,503
Hold on.

558
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:59,284
I'm gonna take this phone downstairs
so I don't disturb you. Is that okay?

559
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:01,198
Sure.

560
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:04,566
Keep him talking.
Write down everything he says.

561
00:33:07,938 --> 00:33:09,514
Stacy...

562
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:16,510
[Sighs]
that new makeup you bought,
you mind if I borrow it?

563
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:23,385
What did you mean by stain?

564
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,424
Dirty? Soiled?

565
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:27,211
No. No.

566
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:31,035
Foreman:
What about rhymes?
Uh, pain. Brain?

567
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:32,872
Thane?

568
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:37,993
He's dying from some kind of infection,
and you allare playing word games?

569
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:40,521
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?

570
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:51,489
Foreman:
L-Let's start this again.

571
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:57,487
Bear.
Is it bare as in naked?

572
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:37,931
Crimson desire
shows up well on sheet rock.

573
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:39,799
That's why I chose it.

574
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,002
You must have gotten
one new phrase out of him.
<i>Something.</i>

575
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:59,760
We've been talking
to him for hours.

576
00:34:59,951 --> 00:35:01,354
Maybe he's just given up.

577
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:03,899
You sure you told me everything
you found at his home and office?

578
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,835
Chase:
No, we're hiding something.

579
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:08,721
- Maybe it's not a rhyme or a synonym.
- What else is there?

580
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:11,023
You think we should just
start guessing randomly?

581
00:35:11,107 --> 00:35:12,937
Maybe House is wrong.

582
00:35:14,353 --> 00:35:16,004
Hope that's not
the end of the thought.

583
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:19,020
He mentioned stain once before
when Chase was giving him the MRI.

584
00:35:19,107 --> 00:35:21,365
- Before we scared him.
- He did?

585
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:23,004
It's in your notes.

586
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:27,693
Chase:
<i>So he only talks during MRIs
and lumbar punctures?</i>

587
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:30,621
Your theory is he can only talk
with a needle in his back or...

588
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:33,353
Or when his wife's
not in the room.

589
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:40,652
The more devoted,
the more reason to lie.

590
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,404
That's cynical.

591
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:43,515
You disagree?

592
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,021
No, I'm just kvelling.
Our little girl is growing up.

593
00:35:48,225 --> 00:35:51,643
Okay, what's the best way
to rip a woman from
the side of her dying husband?

594
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:54,951
He woke me up to lie
to a patient's wife?

595
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:57,750
Tell her there's been
a miscommunication over
their insurance coverage.

596
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:58,954
Not a big deal.

597
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:04,431
Tell me, if it is your aim to sell me
the same crazy ideas that House does,

598
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:07,115
how are you an
improvement on House?

599
00:36:07,115 --> 00:36:09,639
I brought you a coffee.

600
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,528
Your flight's been boarding
for 20 minutes.

601
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:18,043
I'll take a later one.

602
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:21,221
Greg, they can't leave without you.
You checked your knapsack.
[Phone rings]

603
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:23,533
Are we in?

604
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:24,281
Yeah.

605
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,114
House:
<i>Hi, I'm Gregory House.</i>

606
00:36:26,198 --> 00:36:27,834
I'm your attending physician.

607
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:30,313
Your wife's not there.
Start talking.

608
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:33,361
They took my stain.

609
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:36,906
I couldn't tackle the bear.
They took my stain.

610
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,296
House:
Okay, shut up now.
Nice work, Cameron.

611
00:36:39,452 --> 00:36:40,436
Give him the list again.

612
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,646
Let us know when
something sounds right.

613
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:43,661
Dirty?

614
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:46,717
Soiled? Pain?

615
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:48,418
- Brain?
- Yes!

616
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,794
Foreman:
Where does that get us?

617
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:53,088
We're already paying plenty
of attention to his brain.

618
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:54,792
We've got an MRI.
We've got a CT.

619
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:56,601
Are we sure he
wasn't reacting to pain?

620
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,097
He's been on painkillers.

621
00:36:58,181 --> 00:36:59,554
House:
<i>Come on, Chase.</i>

622
00:36:59,638 --> 00:37:03,005
Drugs didn't do this to him.
Even if he is an addict.

623
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:04,817
I dissuade the tonal category.

624
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:08,674
<i>Oh please,
Mr. Sleeping Pills.
Amphetamines.</i>

625
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:11,102
Bring me up.
Bring me down.

626
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:14,765
Announcement:
<i>Will passenger Gregory House
please report to gate seven?</i>

627
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,138
<i>Gregory House to gate seven.</i>

628
00:37:21,055 --> 00:37:22,403
Ever hear this one?

629
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:26,641
<i>You build a house.
Each wall has a southern exposure.</i>

630
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:28,899
Big bear comes wandering by.

631
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:30,575
What color's the bear?

632
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:33,973
White. It's a polar bear.
You built your house in the North Pole.

633
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:36,216
House:
<i>Polar.</i>

634
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,571
Whatever your name is,
patient, are you bipolar?

635
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:43,022
House:
<i>What? I can't see.
Is he nodding?</i>

636
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:44,540
Yes.

637
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:48,001
Topamax isn't just off-label
for weight loss.

638
00:37:48,088 --> 00:37:49,978
It's off-label
for mood disorders.

639
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,322
Plenty of bipolars are
manic in the daytime,
depressive at night.

640
00:37:53,392 --> 00:37:56,931
He's been medicating
for years with alcohol.
Sleeping through the bad hours.

641
00:37:57,036 --> 00:37:58,814
<i>It explains
the danger journalism.</i>

642
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:01,365
<i>It explains everything,
including the kitchen sink.</i>

643
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:03,399
<i>Okay, technically
it's kitchen cabinets.</i>

644
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:05,369
He starts a project,
then he stops.

645
00:38:05,411 --> 00:38:08,930
Except bipolar disorder
does not cause seizures.

646
00:38:09,014 --> 00:38:11,165
House:
<i>And it doesn't shut down
your kidneys. But what it does do...</i>

647
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:12,897
Guard:<i>Excuse me, sir.
May I see your ID?</i>

648
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:15,288
House: <i>I'm on the phone.</i>
Guard: <i>Now, please.</i>

649
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,129
House? What is it?

650
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,058
<i>I'm a doctor.
This is an emergency call.</i>

651
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:20,905
You have to come
with me, Sir.

652
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:22,043
I'm not going anywhere.

653
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:23,527
Do you think
you're gonna take me on?

654
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:25,680
I kick, and I bite.

655
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,941
You're either on that plane,
or you're going into custody.

656
00:38:36,654 --> 00:38:37,531
Foreman:
<i>House?</i>

657
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,698
You still there?

658
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:41,629
Being bipolar
makes you take risks.

659
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:44,744
You seek excitement.
You make up stories.

660
00:38:44,828 --> 00:38:47,322
I dime valutate a lever!

661
00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:51,056
Fine, maybe your stories are legit.
But people would start to wonder.

662
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:55,008
<i>Annoyed politicians.
Entire governments
would be on your ass.</i>

663
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:57,339
<i>So you couldn't tell anybody
you were bipolar.</i>

664
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,185
Which was fine

665
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,540
until you fell in love.

666
00:39:04,495 --> 00:39:06,677
And you wanted that life.

667
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,794
And you hear that
there's a surgical cure.

668
00:39:11,611 --> 00:39:15,264
<i>You can give the woman you love
the life she wants.</i>

669
00:39:15,776 --> 00:39:18,123
All you have to do is change.

670
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:24,230
Bilateral cingulotomy.

671
00:39:24,314 --> 00:39:28,332
<i>An experimental surgery
that some people claim
helps mood disorders.</i>

672
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:31,225
And if it's done by gamma knife,
there's no trace of cutting.

673
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,248
That's the neural scarring
we saw on the MRI.

674
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:36,366
Which explained nothing because
it wasn't even in the right area.

675
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,223
It's not the surgery.
It's the secrecy.

676
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,637
What causes recurring fever?

677
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:45,996
Neurological problems,
lethargy that you fight with
caffeine pills and amphetamines?

678
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,352
<i>It wasn't your secret
psych disorder.</i>
[Door opens]

679
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,456
<i>It wasn't your
secret daily drug use.</i>

680
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:55,332
<i>It was the secret trip
for your secret surgery
in Caracas or Buenos Aires.</i>

681
00:39:55,512 --> 00:39:58,356
Which, by the way,
didn't work, given the state
of your kitchen cabinets.

682
00:39:58,505 --> 00:39:59,670
Cameron:
House!

683
00:40:00,112 --> 00:40:01,918
Shut up.

684
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:04,689
What's going on?

685
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:11,756
Is he right?

686
00:40:13,806 --> 00:40:17,460
Your doctors
know you better than I do.

687
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:23,732
That man on the speaker phone,
he never even met you, and
he knows you better than I do.

688
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:28,469
You love me?

689
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:35,057
Yes. Yes.

690
00:40:35,158 --> 00:40:37,817
You just don't trust me.

691
00:40:41,975 --> 00:40:43,852
House:
<i>Get some blood on a slide.</i>

692
00:40:43,936 --> 00:40:45,816
Do not put it through
a computer this time.

693
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,962
Yep.

694
00:41:01,517 --> 00:41:03,921
Foreman:
Cerebral malaria.

695
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:08,183
I'll get him started
on intravenous quinidine.

696
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:13,781
If a human being had
actually looked at his blood
anywhere along the way,

697
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,889
instead of just running tests
through the computer,

698
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:19,806
the parasites would have
jumped right out at them.

699
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:22,850
The price
of the electronic age.

700
00:41:37,906 --> 00:41:39,248
Greta:
Fletch.

701
00:41:40,184 --> 00:41:42,481
She'll be back.

702
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:50,015
Give her time to miss you.

703
00:41:58,485 --> 00:41:59,976
Announcement:
<i>Final boarding call for Flight No. 7...</i>

704
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,387
I'm counting on you
to get me off the no-fly list.

705
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:03,984
Is your patient
gonna be all right?

706
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,116
Physically,
his chances are good.

707
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:07,230
Physically?

708
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:09,902
Two people who weren't
meant to be together.

709
00:42:10,304 --> 00:42:13,296
Maybe they'll get a happy ending
just because they both want it so much.

710
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,350
Yeah, that's usually
the way it works.

711
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:18,465
He loved her enough to convince
himself he could change.

712
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:23,187
But he couldn't, could he?

713
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,637
Thank you.

714
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,545
You know what Woody Allen
said about relationships?

715
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:35,417
Irrational and crazy,
but go through it all because...

716
00:42:35,501 --> 00:42:37,145
We need the curry.

717
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:46,280
