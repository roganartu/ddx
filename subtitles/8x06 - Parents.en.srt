1
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:03,418
Okay, boys and girls.

2
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:05,345
Guess what kind of animal

3
00:00:05,356 --> 00:00:07,215
Wacky Benny's making now?

4
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:09,732
<i>Give you a big hint.</i>

5
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:13,860
<i>Bor-ing.</i>

6
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:19,438
Is it a dead animal?

7
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:23,809
I say we put him
out of his misery

8
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,577
and bring out Emma's cake.

9
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:27,397
He's so new to this.

10
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:29,061
<i>How's he gonna learn
if we stop his act?</i>

11
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:30,444
You're a sucky clown.

12
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,222
And you're
a super-duper audience.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,746
Hey, that is not okay.

14
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:41,502
Hey, keep your hands
off my son.

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,287
Tell him to keep
his hand off me.

16
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:55,388
I can't move my arm or leg.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,417
House S08E06
"Parents"

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,166
By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es
==SPREAD THE WORD==

19
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:31,487
So how does a completely healthy
teenager have a mini-stroke?

20
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:34,369
<i>Head CT and cerebral
angiogram are normal.</i>

21
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:36,292
Clotting parameters are normal.

22
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,720
You're forgetting
the wrinkly clump

23
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:40,066
in the middle of his shirt.

24
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:43,062
Thought we'd diagnose
the middle-aged clown first.

25
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:45,099
It's probably
from my seat belt.

26
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:46,279
<i>Wrinkle pattern's too varied.</i>

27
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,262
It looks like someone
shoved you or grabbed you.

28
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:49,253
Probably from the diaper bag.

29
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:50,587
If the patient's using drugs,

30
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:52,888
cocaine could have caused
an arterial spasm in his brain.

31
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,338
The tox screen was clean.

32
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:57,507
I'm gonna say it was the
ex-girlfriend you cheated on,

33
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,552
not the ex-wife
you cheated with.

34
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,102
If the latter
was prone to violence,

35
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:04,618
you'd have been scattered
in various dumpsters years ago.

36
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,420
Seriously?

37
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:10,678
No one else wants to talk
about the patient?

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,667
New office furniture.
Meaty topic.

39
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:15,369
What's the action
on the ex-wife?

40
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:19,233
It was Rachel's boyfriend Phil.

41
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:20,643
His company's moving him
back to Portland.

42
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:23,076
He wants me to change
my visitation order

43
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:25,116
so he can ask Rachel
and my daughter

44
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,588
to move out west with him.

45
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:27,831
<i>Things got a little heated.</i>

46
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:31,804
The patient
was punched in the groin.

47
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:35,438
Could have triggered a massive
sympathetic discharge.

48
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:36,351
Carotid duplex is normal.

49
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,786
Who's better qualified
to be the daddy?

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,667
The guy who spilled
a little DNA in her gene pool

51
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:43,292
or the guy who's gonna be there
day and night

52
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,650
to pass on important values

53
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:48,093
like not shtupping mommy
after the divorce?

54
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,680
I am her daddy.

55
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:51,643
She's staying here.

56
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:52,851
<i>House has a point.</i>

57
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,619
A couple nights a week
with each kid

58
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:55,672
may make you feel better.

59
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,647
Doesn't replace two
'round-the-clock parents.

60
00:02:57,649 --> 00:03:00,114
'Round-the-clock or not,
parenting's an impossible job.

61
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:02,243
No way not to mess it up.

62
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:03,858
Why shouldn't Taub be
the one to do it?

63
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:05,965
<i>- Thank you.
- Makes sense.</i>

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,720
Park's tiger mom and dad
were so insufferable,

65
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:11,092
<i>she has to measure
their affection in hours.</i>

66
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:13,633
Chase's careerist dad
and alcoholic mom

67
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,046
<i>were so indifferent,
he has to believe it's a wash.</i>

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,133
<i>Your turn.</i>

69
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,504
What did your
screwed-up parents do

70
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:21,461
to screw up
your view of parenting?

71
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:23,096
They were good parents.

72
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:24,629
That's an oxymoron.

73
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,464
Chase is right. All parents
screw up all children.

74
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,457
He's also dreamy,
but it's not relevant now.

75
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:31,565
<i>So all parents screw up
all children,</i>

76
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,675
but it makes
some huge difference

77
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,347
if I keep my daughter here
or let her move?

78
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:36,730
<i>Endocarditis.</i>

79
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:38,517
<i>Flipd a piece of vegetation
into his brain,</i>

80
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,314
which could have broken up
before the angiogram.

81
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:43,408
Transesophageal echo
to confirm.

82
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,693
Screwed up is your best case.

83
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:48,399
Bouncing between
a philandering workaholic dad

84
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,740
and an embittered,
sexually betrayed mom,

85
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:54,410
it's gonna lead
to screwed-up squared.

86
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,933
Is endocarditis treatable?

87
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,166
Very. The echo will show us
any growths on his heart valve.

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,006
<i>Most likely meds
will be enough.</i>

89
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,282
<i>He won't even need surgery.</i>

90
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,269
<i>He's just taken up performing</i>

91
00:04:06,303 --> 00:04:08,681
and it's very stressful
for him.

92
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,012
Could that have caused this?

93
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,036
It's not stressful.
I have fun.

94
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,252
Stress wouldn't be relevant,

95
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:14,939
but anything that
increases his adrenalin

96
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:17,422
could have made it worse.

97
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:18,570
Maybe we find you a new hobby,

98
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,045
one you're a little better at.

99
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:24,681
I'm gonna get better at it,
and it's not a hobby.

100
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:28,347
I-I think I want to get a job
working as a circus clown,

101
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,422
<i>making people laugh.</i>

102
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:35,380
Ben, I-I don't think
that's a good idea.

103
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:36,657
It was good enough for my dad.

104
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:39,779
You're a, uh...

105
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:41,452
no, his biological father.

106
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,037
Could his dad's melanoma
be a factor here?

107
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:46,117
That wouldn't be related.

108
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,796
Ben, you barely knew him.

109
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,103
<i>You're such a smart kid.</i>

110
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:51,366
You could aim a lot higher

111
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:54,314
than face paint
and seltzer bottles.

112
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:59,680
I need treatment
for my type 2 diabetes.

113
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:04,282
There is absolutely no part
of that sentence that is true.

114
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:05,782
I've been experiencing
weight gain, fatigue,

115
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:06,782
and sluggishness.

116
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:10,003
Weight loss is a symptom
of diabetes.

117
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,408
<i>Fatigue is a symptom</i>

118
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,460
of thinking you have disease
you don't actually have,

119
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:15,762
and sluggishness is a synonym
of fatigue.

120
00:05:15,796 --> 00:05:18,083
I need Insulin.
I know it.

121
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,357
<i>Much as I'd like to kill you</i>

122
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,479
by dangerously lowering
your blood sugar,

123
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:23,298
murder violates my parole.

124
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,014
That bloodwork is week's old.

125
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:26,173
Test me again.

126
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,021
I am the test.
The test is negative.

127
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:34,211
The test also thinks you're
a giant pain in the ass.

128
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,664
That last insult
was your cue to leave.

129
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:40,025
Test me.

130
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:45,315
Fine. Wait right here.

131
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,682
Thank you.

132
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,494
Sleep study.

133
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:52,100
Please make sure
he's not disturbed

134
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:53,964
for the next eight hours.

135
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,972
We need to talk
about Saturday night.

136
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:58,635
No, no, no, no, no.

137
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:02,275
Historians will talk
of Saturday night, not us.

138
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:03,414
The legendary night

139
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,280
on which we watch Santos
shatter Rubio's jaw

140
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:08,244
and you epically pay me $50.

141
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,459
I have a chance
to really watch it.

142
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:13,009
A patient of mine has a pair
of tickets he can't use,

143
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:17,587
and obviously you're under
hoe and office arrest.

144
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,173
I just wanted to make sure
you were cool

145
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,674
if I go to without you.

146
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,499
Uh, no, thanks.

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,764
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
decline your invitation

148
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:28,183
to not spend Saturday night
with you.

149
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,227
These are ringside seats.

150
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:32,435
Cameras are ringside too.

151
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:34,474
If you want,
I could sweat and spit

152
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:36,561
and bleed on you
from time to time.

153
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:38,613
I'd take you if I could.

154
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:40,310
Well, I'd take me
if either of us could.

155
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:42,208
See what a tough spot I'm in?

156
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:44,027
I'm going to that fight.

157
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,334
All right, I'll take
the other ticket.

158
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,690
Let me worry about logistics.

159
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:02,368
Patient's heart valves
are normal.

160
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,042
It's not endocarditis.

161
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:05,088
But he has a thickened
pericardium,

162
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,104
which makes no sense.

163
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:07,656
He has a heart problem

164
00:07:07,732 --> 00:07:10,036
but not one that could have
caused his T.I.A.

165
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,298
Syphilitic vasculitis
would explain the T.I.A.

166
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,233
And the pericardial
inflammation.

167
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:15,016
<i>Syph test was negative.</i>

168
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,032
Plus, the kid's never been
sexually active.

169
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,882
Yeah, I got that from
the line in his chart

170
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,340
that says "birthday clown."

171
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,798
His late father
was a circus clown.

172
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:23,582
Histoplasmosis?

173
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:24,862
<i>He's not immuno-compromised.</i>

174
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:26,790
And I assume you added that
irrelevant tidbit

175
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,057
<i>because you're moved by
the son's idiotic tribute</i>

176
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:32,001
and think it justifies keeping
your daughter in New Jersey.

177
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:33,704
What if he has a heightened
immune system?

178
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,547
I mentioned it because...

179
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:39,087
Take your time.

180
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,531
We'll continue
with the medicine.

181
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,576
Sjogren's could have given him
chronic pericarditis

182
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,562
<i>and cerebral arteritis.</i>

183
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:45,805
Sjogren's it is.

184
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,515
IV immunosuppressant to treat.

185
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:50,460
Anything?

186
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:54,692
<i>This will calm
your immune system.</i>

187
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:57,895
Should be out of here
within the week.

188
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:00,214
My mom will be happy
to hear that.

189
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,873
I've got an internship
that starts in three weeks.

190
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:05,727
I take it it's not at
a place with a big top.

191
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:09,452
It's at
my stepdad's law office.

192
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,151
I know I'm not any good
at being a clown yet,

193
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:16,981
but when I do get a laugh

194
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,927
and see those kids' eyes
light up,

195
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:22,823
that's how my dad made me feel
when I was a kid.

196
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:25,866
You need to hang on to that.

197
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,600
Heh.

198
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:31,901
My mom says he was
a loving father

199
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:36,208
but always broke
and always on the road.

200
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,073
It's just a stupid way
to make a living.

201
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:44,708
You're 16.
Plenty of time to make money.

202
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:47,547
Wanting to build a connection
with your dad

203
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:50,176
<i>and pass on some of the joy
that he gave you,</i>

204
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,705
that's not stupid at all.

205
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:56,792
Ooh. I got it.

206
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:06,089
Is, uh, is this because
of the medication?

207
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,510
Is it normal?

208
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,915
It's not normal,
and it's not Sjogren's.

209
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,479
T.I.A.,
thickened pericardium,

210
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,236
and now he's bleeding
from his nose and mouth.

211
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,952
What are you doing with her?

212
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,586
"Her"?

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,500
Surely this bundle of fun
has an actual name.

214
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,974
It's Sophie.

215
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:42,880
Both your kids are named...

216
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,611
She's Sophie.
The other one's Sophia.

217
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,129
It different enough.

218
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,186
<i>they actually have</i>

219
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:50,948
two completely different
derivations.

220
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,454
No, they don't.

221
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:55,981
I wasn't in a strong
negotiating position.

222
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:56,989
Why is she here?

223
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:58,525
Ruby dropped her off.

224
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,912
Seemed pretty upset.

225
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,460
Apparently someone forgot
that it was daddy's night.

226
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,740
<i>She wasn't even gonna leave her</i>

227
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,519
until I said that I was
letting you off early.

228
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,696
Damn it. I just started
back on the team.

229
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:08,951
My schedule's a mess.

230
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:10,621
If your own kids
are a scheduling item,

231
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,718
maybe you should let
one of them move.

232
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,596
Patient has low platelets.

233
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:15,428
Makes me think D.I.C.

234
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,168
<i>She doesn't seem
to like that idea.</i>

235
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,885
You're right.

236
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:22,193
He has no
schistocytes in his smear.

237
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:24,388
He also has a low red count.

238
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,027
What if it's
a retroperitoneal bleed?

239
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,399
No Grey-Turner's sign.

240
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,719
She wasn't fussing like that
when I was holding her.

241
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,812
<i>Maybe she likes
the sound of my voice,</i>

242
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:37,764
which is weird because I have
no genetic connection to her.

243
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:41,376
Could it be she doesn't
know the difference?

244
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,815
So many children of your own.

245
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,051
No wonder you have such insight

246
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,051
into my relationship
with my babies.

247
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,365
<i>Good point.</i>

248
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,080
How could I comprehend
that you're too despised

249
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:50,629
to keep them from having
the same name,

250
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:52,620
<i>too overwhelmed to remember
your own calendar,</i>

251
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,364
<i>and too vain to admit
that at this stage,</i>

252
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:58,243
you don't matter
to either baby.

253
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:00,038
Low white count
suggests infection.

254
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:02,872
What if you're allright?

255
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:04,425
<i>Low platelets
plus low red count</i>

256
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:06,214
<i>plus low white count equals...</i>

257
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,241
Aplastic anemia.

258
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:10,318
Kid needs a bone marrow
transplant.

259
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:11,886
Everyone except Adams,

260
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:14,608
transfuse his platelets
till you find a match.

261
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:24,761
You started college
a semester late

262
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:27,638
<i>because you left high school
a semester late</i>

263
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:30,301
because you had
five incompletes

264
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,331
in your junior year.

265
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:33,995
And you're offering
one bad semester

266
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:35,795
as proof that my parents
screwed me up?

267
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,279
Did okay before that.
Straight as after that.

268
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:39,564
I went through
a rebellious phase.

269
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,672
Don't tell me.

270
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:43,500
Mom and dad were at
each other's throats

271
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:47,252
and the academic crisis
was a cry for help.

272
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:50,837
Sorry to mess with
your world view,

273
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,544
but I'm not messed up,

274
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:54,792
so my parents couldn't have
messed me up.

275
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,479
Mom's HLA is only a 3/6 match.

276
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,531
Maternal grandmother's
worse than that.

277
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:03,021
Where did you unload the baby?

278
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,478
- Maternity ward.
- Shut up.

279
00:12:04,671 --> 00:12:07,718
You realize you're making
House's argument for him.

280
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,921
The part where he said
any parent who uses day care

281
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:11,832
should ship their child
across the country?

282
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:14,053
No, the part where he said
that baby doesn't need you.

283
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:15,947
<i>You've only got her
a couple days a week</i>

284
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:18,050
and most of that's spent with
a rotating cast of nurses.

285
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,353
That's how daddy likes to
spend his time too.

286
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:20,915
Shut up.

287
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:22,120
First cousin's also a whiff.

288
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:24,148
So much for genetics mattering.

289
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:26,085
I'll try the marrow registry.

290
00:12:29,694 --> 00:12:31,094
<i>- Dr.
- Park is searching the registry.</i>

291
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:33,622
<i>Transfusing his platelets will
keep him healthy while we wait.</i>

292
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,710
Are you sure there's no one on
the father's side of the family?

293
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:38,498
If one of them's a match,
that'd speed things up a lot.

294
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:41,028
His parents died young.

295
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,251
He was an only child.

296
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,217
There's no living relatives
that I know of.

297
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:45,542
Something will turn up soon.

298
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,365
How soon is soon?
Will he miss a lot of school?

299
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,045
I'm actually thinking of
just getting my ged.

300
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:53,367
How do you expect to get
into a good college?

301
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,719
I'm gonna take classes
on magic and juggling

302
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,007
and try to make a go of this.

303
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,220
Ben, you keep
your grades up, you can do

304
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:00,541
anything in the world.

305
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:03,612
Like what? Work in
some boring office?

306
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:05,221
<i>I mean, do you think my father</i>

307
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:06,517
would have done that
for ten minutes?

308
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,003
You don't remember your father.
You don't know...

309
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,763
I want to build
a connection with him,

310
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:17,345
pass on some of the...
The joy that he gave me.

311
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,786
My, uh, my back hurts.
Uh...

312
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,689
His BP is dropping.

313
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,299
<i>We think we've dealt wit
all the liability issues.</i>

314
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,450
I'm in a meeting.

315
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:34,701
Sorry.

316
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:37,413
Since you paged me, I didn't
want to keep you waiting.

317
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:39,877
Yeah, I paged you,
which means you're next.

318
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,501
That's cool.
I'll wait.

319
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:43,887
That's a good start.

320
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:46,114
Let's go through it
point by point.

321
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:48,282
First up...

322
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:54,305
I'll call you back.

323
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:58,013
Just got this.

324
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:00,378
The American Associate
of Rheumatology

325
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:03,108
wants you to speak,
9:00, Saturday,

326
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,255
in Atlantic City.

327
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:08,181
Dr. Neusinger canceled on them
at the last minute.

328
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:11,022
Hmm. I hate conferences.

329
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:14,920
This is a big one,
and it's the premium slot.

330
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,967
I'd like you to do it.

331
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:19,054
I'll clear it with
your parole officer.

332
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,468
What do I need to do for you?

333
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:27,974
Halve the clinic hours
that you recently doubled

334
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:31,963
and double the hooker budget
that you recently halved.

335
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:35,418
I think you refer to it
as petty cash.

336
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:39,615
Fine.

337
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,479
Just one thing.

338
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,957
I'm gonna ask them to
put you on in the morning.

339
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:45,112
We're doing them a favor.

340
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:46,455
Why should you
have to spend the night?

341
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:50,577
You said that 9:00
was the premium slot.

342
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:52,940
I mean, I want to feel like
I've earned my hookers.

343
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:54,733
The place'll be a madhouse,

344
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,572
especially since it's two miles
from the Rubio fight

345
00:14:57,624 --> 00:15:00,147
at the exact same time.

346
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:01,630
Nice try.

347
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:03,633
You called up,
pretended to be Neusinger,

348
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,865
cancelled, and suggested
yourself as a replacement.

349
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,730
You go to that fight,
you go to prison.

350
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:11,488
But that'd be redundant,
when I have an angry black guy

351
00:15:11,598 --> 00:15:13,641
waiting for me to drop
the soap right here.

352
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,700
Better go do some of those
clinic hours I recently doubled.

353
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:25,050
Test my urine.

354
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:27,268
Looks like I was wrong
about my diagnosis.

355
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:28,942
Yeah. I have diabetes.

356
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:31,515
No, but you're not
a hypochondriac

357
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:33,693
or you would have imagined
some new disease

358
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,196
after I shot down
the first one.

359
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:36,519
So whose urine is that?

360
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:38,404
Diabetic girlfriend without
health insurance?

361
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:41,153
It's not a scam.
I'm sick.

362
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:42,628
Now I have swollen ankles.

363
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,668
The medical term is cankles.

364
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:46,571
Is there some black market
in Insulin

365
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:47,421
that I don't know about?

366
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:48,930
It's in my genes.

367
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:50,876
My old man got diabetes at 50.

368
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:52,057
My older brother got it at 50.

369
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,492
I just turned 50.

370
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:56,042
Well, it's a great argument
if diabetes was a gold watch.

371
00:15:56,077 --> 00:15:58,181
I got sciatica, like my dad.

372
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:00,884
Class-four hemorrhoids,
like him.

373
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:02,230
I need to get a jump
on this thing.

374
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:07,146
We had to stop the transfusion.

375
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,395
Patient's having an allergic
reaction to donor platelets.

376
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:10,757
No one in mom's family's
a match,

377
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:12,947
and as far as she knows,
dad has no living relatives.

378
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:15,763
<i>It's been years since he died.</i>

379
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,797
If the kid's dad
died young of melanoma,

380
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,346
<i>how come the overprotective mom</i>

381
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:30,218
never took him
to a dermatologist?

382
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:31,570
Are you gonna test my urine
or what?

383
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:47,486
Not diabetes.

384
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:50,094
Use cross-matched platelets.

385
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:51,314
Try to find the patient
some blood

386
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:52,755
that's closer to his own.

387
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:55,765
<i>And get the real story
on clown, senior's death.</i>

388
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,224
Mom's hiding something.

389
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:59,220
It's a good bet that it's
medically relevant.

390
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,648
Apple juice.

391
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,159
Easiest way to fake a spike
in blood sugar.

392
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:11,902
His family history of melanoma

393
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:15,224
may have affected
his cellular outlook.

394
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:16,677
If we had more data

395
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:18,881
on the exact type of melanoma
his father had...

396
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:24,908
Otherwise, we might not be able
to find a marrow match.

397
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,677
He never had melanoma.

398
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,534
How did he die?

399
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:31,823
He didn't.

400
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:39,535
He lives in pennsauken
under a different name,

401
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:41,001
Mitchell Gordon.

402
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:43,580
How could you keep this
from me? From Ben?

403
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:48,441
He really needs to know

404
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,963
his dad just breezed
in and out of his life,

405
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:52,404
drunk and incoherent?

406
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:56,658
It's better to think
the man's dead but decent.

407
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:07,374
<i>You realize I have to invite
someone else to the Rubio fight?</i>

408
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,207
<i>- Nope.
- No realization whatsoever.</i>

409
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,047
You have a LoJack on your leg.

410
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:13,787
I was happy watching the fight
on pay-per-view.

411
00:18:13,821 --> 00:18:15,730
You're the one who insisted
we go to Atlantic City.

412
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,701
Your biological father
was a decent,

413
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:33,030
God-fearing minister.

414
00:18:33,064 --> 00:18:35,085
The guy who raised you
was a cold-hearted jerk.

415
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,409
I'm trying to figure out
why you're so convinced

416
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:40,200
Adams has parentally
inflicted damage.

417
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,685
You're trying to deflect.

418
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,290
Now you are.

419
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,709
You have to believe that every
parent screws up every child

420
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:48,990
or you were screwed out of
a decent childhood.

421
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:50,939
My decent daddy of the cloth

422
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:54,351
was also being indecent
with my married mom.

423
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:57,300
He probably would have taken
other kids to the playground.

424
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:03,106
It's not my fault.
Bad parenting.

425
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,771
Mitchell Gordon?

426
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:17,326
I've already got a religion.
Go away.

427
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,251
We're doctors.

428
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:20,848
Your son Ben
is in the hospital,

429
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,714
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

430
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,341
He's very sick.

431
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:29,221
Yeah, well, I don't have
a son. Not anymore.

432
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,759
We know there are
some issues there,

433
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:32,949
but your bone marrow
could cure him.

434
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,551
There's a hospital
two miles from here.

435
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:36,681
It's a simple test.

436
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:38,454
You said he was at
Princeton-Plainsboro?

437
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,137
His mother feels it's better
to do the test

438
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,317
at a different hospital.

439
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:46,997
Well, I guess I don't have
a son anymore.

440
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,129
House isn't gonna give up.

441
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:53,821
Just tell him
about your parents

442
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:55,126
or make up a lie.

443
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,993
I don't want to lie.

444
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,622
I don't want to validate
his ridiculous theory.

445
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:01,281
It's not ridiculous.

446
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,750
En the best-intentioned
parents

447
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,244
end up damaging their kids.

448
00:20:04,278 --> 00:20:07,119
You're a smart,
successful doctor.

449
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:09,472
How much damage could you have?

450
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:15,639
Know how I got
interested in medicine?

451
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,527
When my mother drank,
she couldn't handle me,

452
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,514
so she locked me
in my father's study.

453
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:23,288
Only so many hours you can cry
and bang on the door

454
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,537
before you give up,
find something to read.

455
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,780
We all have family dysfunction.

456
00:20:28,814 --> 00:20:32,380
That's why we're successful.
To fill that hole.

457
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:40,045
My parents have a lot of money,

458
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:43,541
but they didn't make it
legally.

459
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:45,446
White-collar crime?

460
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:47,398
It started with card games.

461
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:50,375
High-stakes poker.

462
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:53,024
Then my dad got into narcotics,

463
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:58,868
at first just selling
but then using too,

464
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,635
or he never would have gotten
into the slave trade.

465
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:05,307
Children mostly.
Easier to pack in small crates.

466
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,603
Plus the shipping's
a lot cheaper.

467
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:13,464
Won't even trust
a co-worker.

468
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:15,518
What did your parents
do to you?

469
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,154
You have to go
see him yourself.

470
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:24,497
He wouldn't even ce
to the door a second time.

471
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:26,875
Okay.
I'll drive over there.

472
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,419
It's a pleural effusion.

473
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:41,505
He had a bleeding problem
earlier.

474
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:43,162
Must be bleeding
into his lungs.

475
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:01,868
Except there's no blood.

476
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:03,069
What does it mean?

477
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:04,435
It means you don't have to
make that drive.

478
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:05,843
The problem isn't his marrow.

479
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:06,746
It's his liver.

480
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,619
<i>- Liver failure.
- Explains everything.</i>

481
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:15,203
The question is, what explains
the liver failure?

482
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,023
It's not an infection.

483
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:18,863
We tried antibiotics,
but he's not responding.

484
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:20,350
More curiously,
what explains the mom

485
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:25,079
lying about dad pushing up
squirting daisies?

486
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:30,019
This is how you plan
to get to the boxing game?

487
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:31,619
Why are you looking at her?

488
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:35,462
'Cause I'm stunned, and
I have to look at something.

489
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,455
Match, bout, fight,
contest, day, Helena.

490
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,398
Almost anything works
after "boxing,"

491
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:45,278
except the word "game."

492
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,640
<i>Your bigger problem is,</i>

493
00:22:46,685 --> 00:22:48,738
the people who design
those things aren't idiots.

494
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:53,263
Can you believe she used to
work in the can?

495
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,409
Nothing is tamper-proof.

496
00:22:54,443 --> 00:22:55,899
<i>It's a synthetic problem.</i>

497
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,746
His liver's not
synthesizing proteins,

498
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,705
so fluid is leaking out
of his blood vessels.

499
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:01,233
And mom's a selfish jerk.

500
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:03,134
<i>She traded up,
married a lawyer,</i>

501
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,437
wants to forget
the lowly circus clown.

502
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,603
You're defending the father
because you feel like a jerk

503
00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:09,925
for baking buns
in two different ovens.

504
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:12,631
<i>You want to believe the
mythical biological connection</i>

505
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:14,296
excuses being a man slut.

506
00:23:14,298 --> 00:23:15,920
Ow!

507
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:17,424
I don't know why I'm starting
to doubt your expertise.

508
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,433
You do have a classified ad
and a piece of metal.

509
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:21,730
It's temperature that
sets it off, not force.

510
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:23,324
The rivets go pop,
I slide in the heating pad.

511
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,684
Easy peasy.

512
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:26,551
More likely the patient has
a hyperammonemic problem.

513
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:28,437
<i>His liver's not
cleaning out his blood.</i>

514
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:30,279
<i>The buildup of toxins
is causing everything.</i>

515
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:32,051
I'm defending the dad
because he got screwed.

516
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,983
After he lost his son,
he lost his job.

517
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:36,070
<i>Been in and out of rehab,
ve up clowning.</i>

518
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:38,316
Yes, as a parent, I empathize.

519
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:39,364
I say we tell the kid.

520
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:41,419
He's a minor,
the mom's his guardian,

521
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,479
and it's not even
medically relevant.

522
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:45,828
She robbed them of
12 years together.

523
00:23:45,862 --> 00:23:47,771
Or she ripped off
the band-aid too late.

524
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:50,796
<i>That memory that she let
son of Bozo establish</i>

525
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,592
is making him chase his father's
moronic profession

526
00:23:53,594 --> 00:23:57,546
when he could be living
the high life in Portland.

527
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,008
And I mean that
metaphorically, of course.

528
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:05,784
This is where you dazzle me
with your contingency plan.

529
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,386
I see why employers are
reluctant to hire ex-cons.

530
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:23,135
Well, what about the patient?

531
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:25,982
Is the problem hyperammonemic
or synthetic?

532
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:27,726
<i>Can't treat for both.</i>

533
00:24:27,774 --> 00:24:29,742
One requires hemodialysis,
the other a liver transplant,

534
00:24:29,744 --> 00:24:31,357
and we couldn't even get
the kid a marrow match.

535
00:24:31,391 --> 00:24:33,801
Get the mom's consent to
pump him full of protein.

536
00:24:33,842 --> 00:24:35,502
<i>If it's a synthetic problem,</i>

537
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:36,826
more fluid will leak
into h chest

538
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,922
and his heart will fail.

539
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:39,391
<i>If it's hyperammonemic,</i>

540
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:41,210
toxins will overwhelm his body
and he'll go into a coma.

541
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:44,033
Do you only like tests that
involve the risk of death?

542
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:45,645
There are some slower,
less conclusive tests,

543
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:48,135
but why take that risk?

544
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:56,553
In here.

545
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:07,989
Oh, my God.
The water.

546
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,225
This is completely my fault.

547
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:14,927
<i>There are very serious risks,</i>

548
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:16,569
<i>but if we don't figure out
what he has,</i>

549
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:19,242
we can't treat him at all.

550
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:28,537
I may be a little
out of bounds here,

551
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:30,634
but in case there are
complications,

552
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,962
it might be a good time
to come clean to your son,

553
00:25:33,072 --> 00:25:35,935
let his father visit.

554
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,557
A little out of bounds?

555
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:41,743
I don't know the history,
but everyone makes mistakes.

556
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,279
Your son worships him.

557
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:45,180
Doctor's right about that.

558
00:25:45,182 --> 00:25:48,111
Oh, yeah? And when
did he learn that?

559
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,121
When he encouraged Ben
to drop out of school?

560
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:53,959
Mitchell is not Ben's father

561
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:55,932
any more than a sperm donor
would have been.

562
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,572
Dr. House?

563
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:07,105
Unless you're a locksmith
or an electrician

564
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,856
with political contacts,
I'm busy.

565
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,694
<i>My husband saw
you in the clinic.</i>

566
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:12,531
Wants treatment for diabetes.

567
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:14,950
My condolences
on your forthcoming divorce.

568
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:16,681
<i>He keeps imagining symptoms,</i>

569
00:26:16,715 --> 00:26:20,635
and now I have to make him
these awful anti-diabetic meals.

570
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:22,699
Since I have no intention
of testing him,

571
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:26,701
treating him,
or cooking for him...

572
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,416
Could you write me a fake
prescription for Insulin?

573
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,536
The advantage
of fake prescriptions is,

574
00:26:32,564 --> 00:26:34,567
you don't have to be
a real doctor to write one.

575
00:26:34,618 --> 00:26:37,741
Just tell me what's safe
to inject in his thigh.

576
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,842
<i>His symptoms will go away</i>

577
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:42,342
and then I can show him
he was never sick.

578
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:43,330
Water?

579
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,498
Imaginary medicine
is not my specialty.

580
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,348
I do have
an imaginary colleague

581
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:51,123
who's just sent me
an imaginary page.

582
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:52,544
Imagine how sorry I am.

583
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:03,516
Still mad about
what happened in the lab?

584
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:06,039
I'm not mad.
I'm being professional.

585
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,928
You claim
you're not screwed up.

586
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,364
You may even believe it.

587
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:11,694
But House doesn't and I don't,

588
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:14,391
so you can wait till he camps
out on your parents' lawn

589
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,376
or you can admit you don't
live on some higher plane

590
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,644
and thank me later.

591
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,613
My, uh, my eye feels weird.

592
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:27,033
What's happening to me?

593
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:32,662
You look tired.

594
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:34,544
I hate it when people say that.

595
00:27:34,554 --> 00:27:35,743
I know, I look bad.

596
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:37,918
I thought you were gonna
go to bed early last night.

597
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:40,802
Like an idiot, I went out
with my girlfriends

598
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,064
to pretend I have a life,

599
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:44,587
when all I did
was flirt with guys

600
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:46,178
who'd have no interest
in a mom,

601
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:48,438
miss the baby I couldn't
wait to get rid of,

602
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:49,432
and then get yelled at
by my mom

603
00:27:49,498 --> 00:27:50,260
for staying out too late.

604
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:51,949
- You need your own place.
- Yes.

605
00:27:52,078 --> 00:27:54,904
I moved back home because it was
too drafty at the four seasons.

606
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,249
So go back to work
at the hospital.

607
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:59,065
Day care costs more than
what I earned as a nurse.

608
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:04,021
Have you considered
sub-standard day care?

609
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:06,850
Why don't you stay here toght?

610
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:10,137
No. I mean,
in the guest room.

611
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,427
I'll watch the baby again,

612
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:12,461
and you can get
a real night's sleep.

613
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,753
You'd do that?

614
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:24,623
Win-win.

615
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:26,097
Mommy gets a rest,

616
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:28,975
daddy gets more time
with his little angel.

617
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:33,982
There's some sweats
in the closet in the back.

618
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:39,453
Lucky girl.

619
00:28:39,494 --> 00:28:44,382
Gets another sleepover
with da-da.

620
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:48,252
It makes a difference.

621
00:28:48,286 --> 00:28:49,769
Doesn't it?

622
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,818
Didn't answer your page
last night.

623
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:04,235
Sorry. Battery died.

624
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:05,875
We got the patient's eye
back in place

625
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:07,447
with steroid injections,

626
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:10,657
but a bulging eyeball means
it's not a liver problem.

627
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:13,299
And mom's determination
to keep dad away,

628
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:15,476
even as her kid
gets sicker and sicker,

629
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:16,796
means she's got more to hide.

630
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,058
It's not diagnostically
relevant.

631
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:19,183
<i>Let's let it drop.</i>

632
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:20,182
You just lost my vote.

633
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:22,502
You flip-flopped
on parental rights.

634
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,004
I've been trying to
persuade the mother,

635
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:25,696
but it's her son,
so it's her call.

636
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,076
Well, that very evolved of you.

637
00:29:27,274 --> 00:29:30,942
Don't usually see Darwinian
changes over breakfast.

638
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:35,404
You made nice-nice with Phil,
you decided that

639
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,822
he'd make a decent father
for thing 2 after all.

640
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:40,463
I had Sophie again last night

641
00:29:40,497 --> 00:29:41,960
and Ruby slept
in my guest room,

642
00:29:41,994 --> 00:29:43,960
<i>which has nothing to do
with Phil,</i>

643
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:46,113
who will never be a father
to my children.

644
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:48,654
Angioneurotic edema can
cause rapid swelling.

645
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:51,034
Hey, we're having
a conversation here.

646
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:52,936
No abdominal pain.

647
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,547
So that must have been nice,
having Ruby

648
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:55,865
and the baby under one roof.

649
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:57,861
Yes, it was nice having
my daughter in my home.

650
00:29:58,057 --> 00:30:00,722
That's why I would like her
sister to live near my home.

651
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:02,058
Anasarca?

652
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:03,479
Swelling would have
followed gravity.

653
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:06,367
Isn't that getting this whole
parenting thing ass backwards?

654
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:09,328
<i>Aren't you supposed to figure
out what you can sacrifice</i>

655
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:10,842
to maximize their niceness?

656
00:30:10,874 --> 00:30:12,859
And do you think I should
sacrifice myself

657
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:13,687
from their lives?

658
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,245
Just one life,

659
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:18,695
until the other one's mommy
meets someone nicer than you.

660
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,884
Swelling that fast
and localized

661
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:22,206
has to come
from the lymph nodes.

662
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:24,207
<i>Burkitt's lymphoma.</i>

663
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:30,334
Swelling. Cankles.

664
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,744
<i>That's not a
symptom of Burkitt's.</i>

665
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:34,515
- Are you saying it's...
- It's Burkitt's.

666
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:37,149
Prep him for chemo.

667
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:49,899
I think you should
give House permission

668
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:51,295
to go to Atlantic City.

669
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:53,884
We'll stop by
the rheumatology conference.

670
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,172
Everyone's covered.
No.

671
00:30:56,174 --> 00:31:00,058
The guy has earned the right
to go to one boxing match.

672
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:01,773
He's done everything
you've asked...

673
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,678
Funded and staffed
his own department.

674
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,050
Hasn't even broken as much
as a traffic law.

675
00:31:06,084 --> 00:31:08,407
You're right.

676
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,597
So you'll let him go?

677
00:31:10,655 --> 00:31:12,145
No.

678
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:14,560
<i>I get why he wants to go
to that fight.</i>

679
00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:16,099
I'd love to go myself,

680
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:17,775
which is kind of
why I have to stop him.

681
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,140
My job is to be the jerk.

682
00:31:20,174 --> 00:31:22,519
House has to believe that
I have authority over him.

683
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,762
He can't function
under someone's thumb.

684
00:31:24,893 --> 00:31:27,135
I know, which means
you can't go either.

685
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:33,654
Your job is to be his friend,

686
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:35,178
to stay here and sit with him

687
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:36,652
and watch the fight
on pay-per-view

688
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:37,729
while bitching about me.

689
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,156
If we both do our jobs,

690
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,800
we might actually get him
through his parole.

691
00:31:45,348 --> 00:31:47,355
You're right.

692
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:52,746
<i>Sorry to show up like this.</i>

693
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:54,541
I was expecting
a battery of lawyers.

694
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:55,922
No lawyers.

695
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,677
Phil had something that
he would like to say,

696
00:31:58,711 --> 00:32:02,174
so I thought that he should
say it in person.

697
00:32:02,246 --> 00:32:04,959
It was wrong of me
to confront you

698
00:32:04,997 --> 00:32:06,421
about taking Rachel
to Portland.

699
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:09,476
You don't want to move
to Portland?

700
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,650
Of course I do, but this is
about your daughter too

701
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:14,180
and I'm not gonna do
something like this

702
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:15,757
without your support.

703
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:19,162
So you guys are trying
to manipulate me

704
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:21,238
by playing good cop/good cop?

705
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,938
Is that how little
you think of me?

706
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:28,496
It's clear you're back
working for House.

707
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,611
I will see you this weekend
when you pick up Sophie.

708
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:32,161
Sophia.

709
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,932
We actually started
calling her Sophie.

710
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:34,836
Yeah.

711
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,950
Great.

712
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:39,982
It's cute.

713
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:47,602
Cankles.

714
00:32:47,654 --> 00:32:50,951
Is there some problem with
the prescription you gave me?

715
00:32:50,997 --> 00:32:54,313
I'm faint. I've been
gaining more weight.

716
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,883
I think I need a bigger dose.

717
00:32:55,918 --> 00:32:58,559
If you double his placebo,
he might drown.

718
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:04,372
Also, you forgot to mention
that your heart rate is slow.

719
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,771
My... my heart rate is not...

720
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:10,316
52.
The technical term is slow.

721
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:13,981
Those awful anti-diabetic
meals you eat,

722
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:15,556
do they contain bok choy?

723
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,160
A pound of it.
Every day.

724
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:22,696
Bok choy has glucosinolates
which inhibit thyroid function

725
00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:24,712
and account
for all your symptoms.

726
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:26,944
So this isn't diabetes?

727
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:30,076
You have a bad case of irony.

728
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:31,764
The food that you're eating
to stop making you sick

729
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,431
is making you sick.

730
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:36,653
Hey, maybe I don't have my
father's crummy genes after all.

731
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,784
On the other hand,
maybe you're fat enough

732
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,470
to get diabetes
even without him.

733
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:48,790
I can't believe I have cancer.

734
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:52,413
We caught it early.
You should be okay.

735
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:55,818
I could die. I never went
anywhere, did anything.

736
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,007
If my father had lived,

737
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:00,427
everything would have
been different.

738
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:03,256
Your mom and stepdad love you.

739
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:05,315
They've given you a great home.

740
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:08,503
That counts for a lot.

741
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,553
He's crashing.
Everything's shutting down.

742
00:34:20,985 --> 00:34:23,128
<i>Renal failure, lung
failure, heart failure,</i>

743
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:24,434
<i>all before we started chemo.</i>

744
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:27,374
<i>Burkitt's lymphoma is
fast-moving, but not this fast.</i>

745
00:34:31,184 --> 00:34:36,293
No rush. ICU stands for
take your time in Latin.

746
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:37,600
Multiple aneurysms.

747
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,791
That would mean that every
symptom after his T.I.A.

748
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,200
was a coincidence.

749
00:34:41,673 --> 00:34:42,880
Cholesterol emboli?

750
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:45,542
Bingo. Fits perfectly.
Check the file.

751
00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:48,047
Confirm that we did major
abdominal surgery on him

752
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:51,297
<i>and then completely
forgot about it.</i>

753
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:51,898
<i>House.</i>

754
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:58,074
Hello?

755
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:01,725
What the hell
are you doing here?

756
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,000
I was told that this might be
my last chance to see my son.

757
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:06,843
You had no right!
This is none of your business!

758
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,238
- I didn't.
- I called him.

759
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:10,576
This man's Ben's hero.

760
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:11,927
Let them spend
five minutes together.

761
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:17,577
No! Get out of here!

762
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,263
Wait.

763
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,757
You sexually molested your son.

764
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:34,438
Your walk.

765
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,092
<i>Tabes dorsalis.</i>

766
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,590
<i>You have
late-stage syphilis,</i>

767
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:42,147
which you gave to our patient
presumably 12 years ago,

768
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:45,827
<i>which also explains why mom
is not big on family reunions.</i>

769
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:49,992
I shouldn't be here.

770
00:35:57,972 --> 00:36:02,047
We tested him for syphilis.
He was negative.

771
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,688
<i>After 12 years, the active
infection would have died down</i>

772
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:08,293
everywhere except the arteries
in his brain,

773
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:09,851
where it could hide out
from our tests.

774
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:11,797
<i>But when
that six-year-old heckler</i>

775
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:13,889
<i>punched him
in his juggling pins,</i>

776
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,639
<i>it kicked up the dormant
bacteria in his pelvis.</i>

777
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,473
<i>The immunosuppressants
we gave him</i>

778
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:19,956
<i>sent it into overdrive.</i>

779
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,596
<i>The antibiotics we gave him</i>

780
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,628
<i>actually started destroying
the syphilis.</i>

781
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,896
<i>But like pouring water
on a fire,</i>

782
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,152
<i>that led to a trail
of toxic smoke and ash</i>

783
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,614
<i>which made his immune system
overcompensate.</i>

784
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:33,319
<i>Severe Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction.</i>

785
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,631
Is this true?

786
00:36:35,665 --> 00:36:37,268
Yes, Jarisch-herxheimer is real.

787
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,075
It sounds silly, but...

788
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:42,333
Oh, you mean
the... the... right.

789
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:50,893
I found stains on his clothes.

790
00:36:52,682 --> 00:36:57,062
He didn't understand
and he didn't seem traumatized.

791
00:36:57,094 --> 00:37:02,286
I kept trying to talk to him,
but before long, he'd forgotten,

792
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:04,885
and he seemed...

793
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:08,022
And he seemed happy
and he seemed normal.

794
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:09,203
So you made daddy go away

795
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:12,920
and you made sure junior had
no reason to go looking.

796
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,139
I was just trying
to protect him,

797
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:19,134
<i>like I should have done
from the start.</i>

798
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:22,383
Sorry.

799
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:28,636
<i>IV penicillin and
anti-TNF antibodies,</i>

800
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,305
<i>he'll be fine.</i>

801
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:35,142
Apart from the whole
daddy-rape thing.

802
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,594
We're not done.

803
00:37:42,644 --> 00:37:44,263
No, we are not.

804
00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:46,393
Notify the dad's
sexual partners.

805
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:48,738
Notify his employer,
his landlord.

806
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,148
Notify the police.

807
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:51,521
I meant the kid.

808
00:37:51,555 --> 00:37:53,324
We're not gonna tell him
he was molested?

809
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:56,390
To make him miserable or
to forfeit your license?

810
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:57,864
To tell him the truth.

811
00:37:57,898 --> 00:38:00,900
He's a virgin.
How do we explain the STD?

812
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:02,743
It's a medical diagnosis.
Screw the parents.

813
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:03,831
The kid's our patient.

814
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:05,896
I guess Taub's got
a tough choice to make

815
00:38:05,922 --> 00:38:07,736
when the kid wakes up.

816
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:09,118
Why is it my choice?

817
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:10,619
'Cause you're a dad.

818
00:38:10,675 --> 00:38:13,338
How could the rest of us
possibly understand?

819
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,692
What was...
What was wrong with me?

820
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:29,617
It's called syphilis.

821
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:35,285
Uh, you... you can get that
without having sex?

822
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:50,236
I didn't tell him.

823
00:38:53,108 --> 00:38:55,019
Your heart said
he needed to know.

824
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:59,386
Your brain knew he's
better off without it.

825
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,251
Following your heart is easy.

826
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:03,102
Following your brain is tough.

827
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:05,107
<i>Especially after years
of following</i>

828
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:07,866
<i>that much smaller third organ.</i>

829
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,376
That's why all parents
screw up all children.

830
00:39:21,034 --> 00:39:22,814
Evening.

831
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:32,799
Clever tactic, pretending
you're not interested anymore.

832
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:36,545
How could that possibly work
as a tactic?

833
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:38,674
The fact is, once I saw
those incompletes,

834
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,359
I knew your parents
screwed you up.

835
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:44,516
The details are just gravy.

836
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:46,857
You're wrong.

837
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:50,632
The only evidence you have
is proof of something else.

838
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,946
I ran away from home.

839
00:39:57,065 --> 00:40:00,145
Because you had lousy parents.

840
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:03,660
Because I didn't.

841
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:07,059
All my friends' parents
were divorced

842
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:08,812
or having affairs

843
00:40:08,846 --> 00:40:13,471
or barely knew
their kids' birthdays.

844
00:40:13,473 --> 00:40:17,802
You envied their dysfunction?

845
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,549
I-I thought it made them
deeper somehow.

846
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:28,047
It was stupid.

847
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:31,724
I hitchhiked to Manhattan,
moved in with an older guy.

848
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:35,051
In two months,
I came running home.

849
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:39,319
It took my parents years
to get over it.

850
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:42,438
That's when you
started to excel.

851
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:46,062
You were making it up to them.

852
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:49,756
Your parents screwed you up
by not screwing you up.

853
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:52,051
How does briefly
wishing I was screwed up

854
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:54,723
make me screwed up?

855
00:40:54,757 --> 00:40:56,614
It's normal to be screwed up.

856
00:40:56,678 --> 00:41:00,098
It's really screwed up
to romanticize it.

857
00:41:00,313 --> 00:41:04,430
I guess that's why you wanted
to work with prisoners.

858
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:08,293
It's why I wanted
to work with you.

859
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:13,985
It was a tactic.

860
00:41:31,431 --> 00:41:33,120
Chris.

861
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:34,249
<i>Yeah.</i>

862
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:36,983
I need to talk to you and Phil.

863
00:41:39,085 --> 00:41:42,185
Is everything okay?

864
00:41:42,187 --> 00:41:44,090
Yeah.

865
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:57,185
I can't let you move.

866
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,524
You drove all the way out here

867
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,948
just to tell us
what you already told us.

868
00:42:00,982 --> 00:42:04,187
I'm sorry.

869
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:14,977
<i>House, open up.</i>

870
00:42:15,011 --> 00:42:16,915
<i>I don't want to miss
the opening bell.</i>

871
00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:22,859
House?

872
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,401
<i>Telecast, we expect an
electric atmosphere</i>

873
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:38,688
<i>in the arena and a sellout
crowd of about 10,000</i>

874
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:41,389
<i>for Rubio versus Santos,
two great fighters</i>

875
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:43,141
<i>with illustrious careers</i>

876
00:42:43,175 --> 00:42:44,876
<i>who might have been expected
to meet a long time ago.</i>

877
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,549
<i>As for Santos,
his handlers tell us</i>

878
00:42:47,572 --> 00:42:48,576
<i>that he's done more roadwork</i>

879
00:42:48,611 --> 00:42:50,207
<i>than at any time in his career,</i>

880
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:53,653
<i>hoping to prove tonight that
he can box for 12 full rounds.</i>

881
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,897
<i>Significant because Santos
hasn't heard the final bell</i>

882
00:42:57,038 --> 00:42:58,976
<i>in more than six years.</i>

883
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,023
<i>He comes in with
11 straight knockout wins</i>

884
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:03,767
<i>and we saw how a power puncher
with a left hook</i>

885
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,102
<i>was able to cut Rubio
over the right eye</i>

886
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,219
<i>in the tenth round
of that last fight.</i>
