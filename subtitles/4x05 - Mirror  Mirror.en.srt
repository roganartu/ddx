1
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,766
Grandma's got some cash.
We could steal that.

2
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,738
What kind of creep are you?

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,542
We steal from strangers.

4
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:17,480
Hey, Grandma's not gonna call the cops.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,778
Look.

6
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:22,150
Either you start doing
this, or you get a job.

7
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,056
That guy.

8
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:32,428
You're gonna remember that
guy for the rest of your life.

9
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,338
Hey. How you doing?

10
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,977
I said... Hey, give me all your cash!

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,680
Why?

12
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,015
You want to buy yourself a
pretty dress, you little bitch?

13
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,617
He ain't kidding, man.
Where's your wallet?

14
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:06,495
On your sister's nightstand.
I forgot it after I paid her.

15
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,229
Whoa, Tony... You want to die tonight?

16
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,826
I said where's your wallet?

17
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,000
I think he's sick. Maybe you shouldn't.

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,134
He's faking.

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,304
Look, go in his
pockets. Grab his wallet.

20
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,781
Good. Let's go.

21
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,146
You all right, man?

22
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,489
He's fine. He's faking it.

23
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,468
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at Maple and Fourth.

24
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,198
There's a really sick
guy. I think he got mugged.

25
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,706
What? Are you happy? Let's go!

26
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:30,646
Today, we're hunting for
the cat burglar of diseases.

27
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,209
Causes a healthy man's lungs to
fail, but leaves no fingerprints.

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,981
Respiratory distress, could be asthma.

29
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,750
No hyperinflation on the x-ray.

30
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,018
Food allergy. Could have
eaten shellfish or peanuts.

31
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,220
No hives. No erythema on the skin.

32
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,320
Pulmonary embolism.

33
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:47,025
Embolisms don't magically dissolve.

34
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,158
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,428
Laryngospasm.

36
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,333
Frosty fall air hits his vocal cords,

37
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,168
they spasm shut, choke him out.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,038
Good idea. You've been
tremendously helpful.

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,304
You can leave. I just hired him.

40
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,312
Well, I fired him. To infinity.

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,938
You didn't tell him I was coming back?

42
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,413
She did. I said no.

43
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,781
When your extended job
interview slash reality TV show

44
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,877
killed a patient,

45
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,081
you lost your veto power.

46
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,953
Everybody, this is
Dr. Foreman. He will...

47
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,119
Does this mean there's
one less slot for us?

48
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,297
It's still Dr. House's department.

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,527
He decides who stays, who goes...

50
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,660
Foreman goes.

51
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:27,866
But Dr. Foreman will
be my eyes and ears.

52
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,637
You do nothing without his knowledge.

53
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,668
Oh!

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,245
Just in case I need them

55
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,648
where exactly will Dr.
Foreman be keeping my balls?

56
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,047
If you wanna keep your
jobs, that never happened.

57
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,956
The only way to get the cat
burglar is to catch him in the act.

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,119
Give the patient a
methacholine challenge.

59
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,719
See if it sets off laryngospasm.

60
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,991
You want us to stop his breathing?

61
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,760
Well, only until you can figure out why.

62
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,631
After that, it would be irresponsible.

63
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,607
You and I should talk.

64
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,802
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,003
She didn't have to do that publicly.

66
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,171
Yes, she did.

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,239
She had to establish her dominance
in front of them. Limit my power.

68
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,182
There's nothing we can do.

69
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,153
Well, that's not the
never-say-never Dr. Foreman I know.

70
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,211
There's lots we can do.

71
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,314
Not really, Cuddy...

72
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,121
I can make you miserable.

73
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,354
That's true.

74
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,987
Until you quit. Again.

75
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,531
So, why don't we just
skip the middleman?

76
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,725
I'm not quitting.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,669
My God. Not everything's about you and
your little job and your little world.

78
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,969
This is about restoring
order in the universe.

79
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,269
I'm not quitting.

80
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,038
You're gonna be miserable.

81
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,136
I already am miserable.

82
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,984
Cuddy obviously thinks we're idiots.

83
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,990
She's not gonna let
House hire any one of us.

84
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,516
Tidal volume's holding at
1.2 liters. Increase the dose.

85
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,926
So, which master do we serve?

86
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,827
Whose ass do we have
to kiss to get this job?

87
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,093
You really want this job so bad?

88
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,158
How about you try doing this job?

89
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,932
Double the dose to 16
milligrams per milliliter.

90
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,398
My foot's tingling.

91
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,999
Is that normal?

92
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,806
No. What exactly does it...

93
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,279
And my stomach's killing me.

94
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,713
Could this test cause that stuff?

95
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,876
No.

96
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:23,881
Test was a bust.

97
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,856
Amber has moved down to even money.

98
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,620
We found two new symptoms.

99
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,457
Yep. Back to two to one.

100
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,530
What's going on? You're the favorite.

101
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,622
House's? To get fired.

102
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,935
You can bet against
yourself. Lovely parting gift.

103
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,028
What's the limit?

104
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,129
Isn't one.

105
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,468
Five hundred on Kutner.

106
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,372
A thousand on Amber.

107
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,232
Do you take checks?

108
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,403
No.

109
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,976
How do we connect abdominal pain
and numbness in the extremities

110
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,315
with respiratory collapse?

111
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,446
Dissecting aortic aneurysm.

112
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,083
Doesn't cover all three. What else?

113
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,156
Carry on. He's the boss.

114
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,837
What about a spinal cord lesion?

115
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,064
Would have to be in the brain stem.

116
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,436
It still doesn't explain the lungs.

117
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,441
Weird, though.

118
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,874
That he's the boss.

119
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,673
Didn't he quit recently?
Was it a money issue?

120
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,407
Lungs, stomach, numbness...

121
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,847
No, that wasn't it.

122
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,510
It was something else.

123
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,316
Was it bling account? Med plan
didn't cover tattoo removal?

124
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,085
We have to unify these symptoms.

125
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,490
I remember.

126
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,494
You didn't want to turn into me. Right?

127
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,359
You didn't want to become evil.

128
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,159
Can we stick to the medicine, here?

129
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,291
Absolutely.

130
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,834
I'm just flattered.

131
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,839
In a few short weeks, seems like
I've just turned towards the light.

132
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,534
Either that, or you sold your soul.

133
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,075
Multiple marantic emboli could...

134
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,203
Did you get a raise?

135
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,574
Because then you're a whore.

136
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,478
Or didn't you? Because
then, you're a stupid whore.

137
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,853
Patient just crashed.

138
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,186
Can they go, boss?

139
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,065
You're right. But?

140
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,569
No but. You're right about all of it.

141
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,434
Then, I'll see you at the reunion.

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,373
Seems I didn't get out
of here soon enough.

143
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,005
The world thinks I've been
corrupted, so no one will hire me.

144
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,847
I hate being here. I'd
love to quit, but I can't.

145
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,491
He's got a pulse.

146
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,762
Must be another respiratory collapse.

147
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,394
Means this is our chance
to prove laryngospasm.

148
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,405
We need to tube him and bag
him. We will. Right after we...

149
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,100
If we just let him die, it
doesn't matter what he has.

150
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,903
Brennan, tilt his head back
so I can get a straight shot.

151
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,935
Okay. While you're killing him,
I'll get the intubation kit.

152
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:08,283
I decided you're right. You're
obviously in an impossible position.

153
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,185
There's no point in me humiliating you.

154
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,280
Thanks.

155
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,790
So, I'm gonna humiliate Cuddy.

156
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,349
Until she fires you.

157
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,623
Guy's faking. It's Munchausen's.

158
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,597
You notice the EMT run sheet?

159
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,532
Paramedic who brought him in
is also named Martin Harris.

160
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,764
If the name was Attila
Von Weinerschnitzel,

161
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,036
I'd say you might be onto something.

162
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,441
Look, room 406, abdominal pain,

163
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,142
room 403, left-sided
numbness, 402, syncope.

164
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,116
He's copying his neighbors' symptoms.

165
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,548
No. Yeah.

166
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,320
Coincidence is much more likely
than you being a stubborn jerk.

167
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,760
Munchausen's patients
create symptoms, not names.

168
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,388
Munchausen's patients
have medical histories

169
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,989
they don't want us reading.

170
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,193
No laryngeal spasm.

171
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,532
Breathing's resumed normal
rate, without intubation.

172
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,401
You see? Nothing's wrong with him.

173
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,337
He's in a lab coat.

174
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,076
Munchausens pretend to
be patients, not doctors.

175
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,846
He's got Mirror Syndrome.

176
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,544
Giovannini's?

177
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,678
Do you know another Mirror Syndrome?

178
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,247
Brain's got no idea who he
is, where he is, what he is,

179
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,918
so it fills the holes with
whatever dirt's lying around.

180
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,326
He reads a name tag, he's got a name.

181
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,491
Sees a doctor, he's got a job.
Sees symptoms, he's got a problem.

182
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,159
My explanation's simpler.

183
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,703
Well, if it's simple, then
we discharge the nutbar,

184
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,138
but if it's complicated, then
the nutbar has got brain damage.

185
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,971
So, we let him jerk them around
for a few days till we're sure?

186
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,443
No. We let him jerk you around.

187
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,215
There's a faster way.

188
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,920
Mind if we play through?

189
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,289
Sure. What could possibly go wrong?

190
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,725
What's going on here, Martin?

191
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,427
Operation? House?

192
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,557
Who is this guy?

193
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,397
Excellent question.

194
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,437
Who are you, Martin?

195
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,438
He just likes to watch and do stuff.

196
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,312
Number 10 scalpel for initial incision.

197
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,675
Glad you're here, House.

198
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,584
Of course you are.

199
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,644
It's lecture time.

200
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,054
Yeah. It is.

201
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,684
Stop worrying about the power play.

202
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,195
Was that it? I think you
can go a lot deeper, here.

203
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,028
I mean, why am I so
obsessed by all of this?

204
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,932
You're threatened by Foreman and
feel the need to impress Cuddy.

205
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,199
The only thing that's relevant
is Foreman is a good doctor.

206
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,364
He can help you.

207
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,339
Lighten the load. Good idea.

208
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,603
I'll have him sort my mail.

209
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,806
Sure.

210
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,012
Deflect.

211
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,781
Who is this guy?

212
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,150
I think we just found out.

213
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,655
It's all about Cuddy.

214
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,214
You've got to be the alpha dog.

215
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,159
You can almost smell
the pheromones now, huh?

216
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,696
I like him.

217
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,327
Told you I didn't need you. House!

218
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,068
House, what is going on?

219
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,002
Ow!

220
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,020
Your blood's turned to sludge.

221
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,681
If we don't heat you
up, you're gonna die.

222
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,417
Can't fake that!

223
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,264
Mirror Syndrome patients have
no agenda, no ax to grind.

224
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,130
They can read you because they have to.

225
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,705
Moods, attitudes, everything.
They're like mind readers.

226
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,898
Except they can read your mind.

227
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:48,997
Where are we going?

228
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,667
Unfortunately, we have to cure him.

229
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,233
His hand wasn't black when he came in.

230
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,801
The operating room was sterile.

231
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,473
Only thing different was the
temperature. Cold agglutinins means...

232
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,913
It's gotta be some kind of infection.

233
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,315
No fever, so it's gotta be a
tiny infection, hard to find.

234
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,579
And you better find it fast.

235
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:06,614
This guy feels another cool breeze,
his blood turns to slop and he drops.

236
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,956
I need three ways to pinpoint infection.

237
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,154
Blood cultures.

238
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,059
Blood's clumpy. Nothing
you can do with it.

239
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,429
Unless we soak him in warm
water before we draw it.

240
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,967
Good. What else?

241
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,161
Ultrasound his abdomen.
Look for an abscess.

242
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,568
Good. Ladies and gentlemen?

243
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,766
I have a regrettable announcement.

244
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,900
Kitchen has just learned

245
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,774
that our annual shipment of
mayonnaise was improperly stored,

246
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,077
so anybody who ate, well, the food

247
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,481
should head across the lobby
to the clinic right away.

248
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,177
Ask for Dr. Cuddy.

249
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,418
You're not punishing Cuddy.

250
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,081
You're punishing every
doctor in the building.

251
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,682
It's her building. Her
doctors. Still need one more.

252
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,851
Well, we need to find out his history.

253
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,258
Where he's been, what he's done.

254
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,662
Yeah. He has no memory, but
his bio's tattooed to his rear?

255
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,758
The mayo is fine. You can stay
where you are. I'm a doctor.

256
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,999
Mail order. I've seen the diploma.
There's two N's in University.

257
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,438
Big Love was right. History is the key.

258
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,470
No ID, no wallet, no missing
person's report filed for 100 miles...

259
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,038
The key is the key.

260
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,277
He had car keys in his
pocket when he was admitted.

261
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,444
Keep him in the isolation room

262
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,683
so he doesn't pick up Extreme Bitch
Syndrome from one of the nurses.

263
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,223
Run the ultrasound
and the blood cultures.

264
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,656
The cultures were my idea.

265
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,956
No one's keeping score.

266
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,188
You're losing.

267
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,390
Search the street where he was mugged.
Find the car and the registration.

268
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,524
There could be thousands of cars.

269
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,761
Hey, why do I get this assignment?

270
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,531
Because, if you deal with the patient,

271
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,096
he's gonna wind up singing Osmond songs
and proposing to five nurses at once.

272
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,904
I'll go with Cole.

273
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,100
Ooh!

274
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,305
We have a love connection.

275
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,006
Make a fist.

276
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,876
Little pinch.

277
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,155
Wow. That's a strong pinch.

278
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,887
This thing works. You're
lucky you've got me.

279
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,259
My colleague wanted to
cook you in boiling water.

280
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,326
That's right, baby.
My blood's that good.

281
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,472
That's supposed to be me, right?

282
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,602
No.

283
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,613
That's me. I'm always right. Gotta be.

284
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,705
I don't think I'm always...

285
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:14,719
If they don't like you, you've gotta
be right, or you're not worth anything.

286
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,892
Infections can hide
deep beneath the skin.

287
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,828
This will find them.

288
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,059
Who was that last doctor?

289
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,227
Dr. Amber Volakis.

290
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,465
Don't really need her name.

291
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,772
Wait. You saying that you...

292
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,173
I want her?

293
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,380
Don't know what you want.
Don't care what you want.

294
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,442
I'm married.

295
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,215
So am I.

296
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:55,317
Even if I wasn't, she's a
little too aggressive for me.

297
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,622
Hey.

298
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,494
Aggressive is never a bad thing.

299
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,330
Yeah. True.

300
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,576
I'm done.

301
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,006
You okay?

302
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,106
Yeah.

303
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,743
We've gotta run some more tests.

304
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,281
You can clean yourself up.

305
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,425
Lesion on the liver.

306
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,462
Cystic or solid? Solid.

307
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,089
Well, you certainly did the
right thing by coming to me.

308
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,224
Yes. I needed a smug oncologist to...

309
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,666
An authoritative oncologist.

310
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,703
I hate you. Tell me why.

311
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,830
I've been scanning literature.
Very interesting study in Sweden.

312
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,707
Apparently, Giovannini's patients
mimic whoever they think's in charge.

313
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,144
Any country with that low an age of
consent and that high a rate of suicide

314
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,511
isn't thinking straight.

315
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,176
I am in charge of our relationship.

316
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,617
It was a surgery. You were
the surgeon. In that setting...

317
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,851
You would pick up my
laundry if I asked you to.

318
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,118
Go ahead. Ask.

319
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,558
I wouldn't do that to you.

320
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,342
I want all my personal
private doctors back right now!

321
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,002
Except for Foreman.

322
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,876
Your team, Foreman included,

323
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:26,042
is dealing with the Great
Mayonnaise Panic of 2007.

324
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,882
Frankly, I'm worried it might
spread to other continents.

325
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,885
Lesion on the liver. Possibility.

326
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,931
Why are you doing a
pelvic for food poisoning?

327
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,262
She said her hoo-hoo burned.

328
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,434
Lesion on the liver. Ideas?

329
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,098
Start with a biopsy to rule out cancer.

330
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,472
Could be an abscess.

331
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,033
Needle works for that, too.

332
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,875
Well, unless it's a vascular hemangioma.

333
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,006
Aspirate that, and he'll
bleed out, we'll kill him.

334
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,448
If he bleeds out, we know what he had.

335
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,280
Had?

336
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,048
Two diagnoses out of three, he lives.

337
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,851
We do nothing, three
out of three he dies.

338
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:05,947
Go stick his liver.

339
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,219
Where's Foreman? We should...

340
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,419
You need him to draft
your letter of resignation?

341
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,519
You risking our patient's
life to get back at Cuddy?

342
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,191
What? No. That would be childish.

343
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,393
This is what I'm doing
to get back at Cuddy.

344
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,437
Who here doesn't have
any health insurance?

345
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,972
Michael Moore was right.

346
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:27,068
MRIs, PET scans, neuropsych tests,
private rooms for all these patients.

347
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,408
Fight the power!

348
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,782
Sorry. I missed.

349
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,982
I have to reposition the needle.

350
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,491
You're gonna feel another pinch.

351
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,189
You still with me?

352
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,560
I'm here.

353
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,823
You feeling faint?

354
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,924
No.

355
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,330
What's wrong?

356
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,801
It's personal.

357
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,807
You got personal problems?
You got no memory.

358
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:00,936
I'm in a hospital. I don't
want to be in a hospital.

359
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,741
You're sick, so...

360
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,082
I'm bored.

361
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,286
You ask what's wrong,
then you ignore the answer.

362
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,989
Just go on with what you're doing.

363
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,825
You think everything's okay

364
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,632
as long as you don't think
about it, don't deal with it.

365
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,908
Is that blood?

366
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,172
I think it's pus from a fungus.

367
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,077
I have fungus in me?

368
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,981
If you've been in the tropics
in the last few months.

369
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,314
I saw this in tsunami survivors.

370
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,514
Their skin grafts would ooze
black pus sometimes weeks later.

371
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,286
Traced the fungus back to
the sand in the tsunami tides.

372
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,856
That's so cool.

373
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,263
I think the black pus is fungal.

374
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,860
If I'm right, that's where the
cold agglutinins are coming from.

375
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,098
That's what's driving his memory loss.

376
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,700
Amber's putting him on
amphotericin. It will cure him.

377
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,108
This makes no sense.

378
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,704
I'm doing blood tests to be sure,
but the sooner we get him on...

379
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,908
I'm not talking about the infection.

380
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,978
I'm talking about you letting Tonya
Harding administer the treatment.

381
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,818
I'm out of the game. Why?

382
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,950
A couple of weeks ago,
you named me Grumpy.

383
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,586
Said I didn't want to be here, wanted
to be back in the third world...

384
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,789
And you realized I'm right just now?

385
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,025
I got a confirmation.

386
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,566
The patient's nuts.

387
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,694
The patient's unbiased.

388
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,271
The patient has no ax to grind.

389
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,204
The patient is nuts.

390
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,173
I miss my old life.

391
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,370
Helping people who
barely have clean water,

392
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,141
let alone the kind of medicines
we waste by the SUV-load.

393
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:48,243
You're nuts. You're gonna be
miserable at home, at work, somewhere.

394
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,821
The goal in life is
not to eliminate misery.

395
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,754
It's to keep misery to the minimum.

396
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,826
Now, that's inspiring.

397
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,592
You said you came back to get married.

398
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,027
What does your fiancée do?

399
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,496
She's a court reporter.

400
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:04,093
Uh-huh. Well, I'm sure Thailand
will have courts any day, now.

401
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,099
Someone's gonna be miserable
sometime. Accept it.

402
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,404
That's how I stay so happy.

403
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,173
Why do you care if I stay?

404
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,545
You're good.

405
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,247
Don't screw it up just
because you're miserable.

406
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:29,018
I'm gonna stay until
the patient's cured,

407
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,287
which should be in about an hour.

408
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,563
You okay?

409
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,936
Not okay.

410
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,598
Which one of us is he mirroring?

411
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,975
Well, if it was you, he'd be
inflicting pain on someone else, so...

412
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,810
I'd say he's mimicking whichever
one of us happens to be dying.

413
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,153
<i>The heating blanket wasn't
keeping him warm enough.</i>

414
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,317
<i>Ordered a whirlpool,
got his blood flowing.</i>

415
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,951
So far, it's keeping his rash at bay.

416
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,429
Rash worse equals
cold agglutinins worse.

417
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,056
Means what was in his
liver wasn't fungus.

418
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,225
Yeah. Labs confirmed...

419
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,428
That it wasn't even pus.

420
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,336
It was just coagulated blood
caused by the cold agglutinins.

421
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:19,105
Which you mistook for a cool fungus
that you saw after the tsunami.

422
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,236
Same consistency as... You
saw what you wanted to see.

423
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,007
Not what was there.

424
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,515
Wait a second. Didn't you quit?

425
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,075
I spoke to my fiancée. I'm staying.

426
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,586
Of course you are.

427
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,418
Because you're the exact
right amount of miserable.

428
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,992
Broad spectrum
antibiotics aren't working.

429
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,085
It's got to be viral or exotic bacteria.

430
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,753
There are a thousand
microbes it could be.

431
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,855
We could repeat all cultures.
Maybe we just missed it.

432
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,696
Or we could get an accurate history.

433
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,078
We're working on it.

434
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,876
Well, that'll be good
solace to the Widow X.

435
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,711
His car was towed, and
the tow gate's locked.

436
00:21:58,784 --> 00:21:59,876
Guys must be out on a run.

437
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,350
<i>That's why I sent two of you.</i>

438
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,888
One of you breaks in,
the other posts bail.

439
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,923
Getting arrested is not
what I'm worried about.

440
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,586
Not a problem. You know
how to kill dogs, right?

441
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,393
So, we're back to
repeating all the cultures.

442
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,937
Or we get an accurate history.

443
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,632
Didn't we just rule
out that possibility?

444
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,641
You guys ever heard any
of my metaphors, yet?

445
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:29,339
Well, come on. Sit on Grandpa's lap as
I tell you how infections are criminals.

446
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,441
The immune system's the police.
Seriously. Grumpy, get up here.

447
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,110
It will make us both happy.

448
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,384
Anyway, cops don't just
let crooks run free.

449
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,482
They keep fingerprints, mug shots.

450
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:44,119
The immune system does the same
thing, only it calls them antibodies.

451
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,357
We find out what diseases
he's had in his life,

452
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,867
good chance that'll tell us
where he's been in his life.

453
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,630
Alice. Your turn through
the looking glass.

454
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,001
Draw blood and CSF.

455
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,040
Hey, guys.

456
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,442
I haven't signed off on this.

457
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,188
You seem like a good
guy, Cuddy seems decent,

458
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,354
House doesn't.

459
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,729
It means either you're
gonna give in, or Cuddy is.

460
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,394
Either way, I'm sorry.

461
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,139
Your boyfriend has me at even odds.

462
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,240
So talk to him.

463
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,081
I did. He said he's just
responding to market forces.

464
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,212
He is. I got 100 on you.

465
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,188
What do you care what
other people are betting on?

466
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,524
If he's trying to screw with me

467
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,826
'cause he's jealous Cuddy didn't
ask him to take this job...

468
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,060
Right. You're figuring
he's jealous of your misery.

469
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,260
He's messed up enough to...

470
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,428
The problem is you're not miserable.

471
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,335
Then House has been
wasting a lot of time.

472
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,897
You've been humiliated.
Treated like crap.

473
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,943
You have every right to be
miserable, but you're not.

474
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:11,038
Because even though this job is insane,
and House is insane, you like it.

475
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,447
You always have.

476
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,576
You know what's worse than
a sanctimonious speech?

477
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,712
A sanctimonious speech
that's dead wrong.

478
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,415
See?

479
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,458
You belong with House.

480
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,657
We're gonna use your spinal
fluid to tell us where you lived.

481
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,993
Cool.

482
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,660
Not really. It's a poor substitute
for an actual history and without...

483
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,465
Nah. It's cool.

484
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,474
Yes. It is.

485
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,503
I need you to stay as still
as possible. Ignore the pain.

486
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,171
Bring the pain.

487
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,216
I'm not a masochist.

488
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,479
Neither am I.

489
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:53,352
I know. But I was responding
to you responding to...

490
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,857
Never mind.

491
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,093
I just like experience. If
it's new, it's interesting.

492
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,426
Yeah? Not me.

493
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,899
I don't just like new, I gotta have new.

494
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,198
If it's not there, I make it there.

495
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,861
Really, I'm just easily bored.

496
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,770
There are 300 million
people in this country.

497
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,832
If I'm doing exactly what
everyone else is doing,

498
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,342
then who the hell am I?

499
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,345
You know what I mean?

500
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,575
We're just about finished.

501
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,344
I like hot tubs.

502
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,442
They're nice.

503
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:29,885
You don't knock?

504
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,522
Are you putting K
- Y jelly on his phone receiver?

505
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,122
An exploding snake in his drawer?

506
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,394
No.

507
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,562
I'm replacing his Vicodin
stash with laxatives.

508
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,835
Don't. Don't stoop to his level. Why?

509
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,208
Because he's suddenly gonna
realize he's no longer 14?

510
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,870
Either I take his garbage forever,

511
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,574
or I give him a reason to stop.

512
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:55,346
You don't have to make him miserable.
Just make him think that he's won.

513
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,751
I'm not gonna fire Foreman.

514
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,187
I said think he's won.

515
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:02,590
Find some other way to soothe
his ego. The thing's big enough.

516
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,857
You must be able to find
some corner to polish.

517
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,730
Where were you two hours ago?

518
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,829
Where were you?

519
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,104
What do you have? High
titres to histoplasmosis.

520
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:22,975
Probably lived in the Ohio River Valley.

521
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,176
Also weakly positive on Coccidiomycosis.

522
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,412
Weak means older.

523
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,284
Means he moved to Ohio
from the San Joaquin Valley.

524
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,947
Or he happened to visit California.

525
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,855
He's also positive for Chagas' Disease.

526
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,393
Central America.

527
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,395
Or he kissed his maid from El Salvador.

528
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,762
Or he sat next to someone from
Belize on a flight to Weehawken.

529
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,357
Or he ate lettuce from Honduras. Yes.

530
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,904
You're right, buzzkill. This
tells us next to nothing.

531
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,806
But since that's on the something side
of nothing, I thought we'd go with it.

532
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,069
His rash is back.

533
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,976
The hot tub isn't hot
enough to keep his body warm.

534
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,947
So, we take his body out of the
picture. Let's hit him from the inside.

535
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,880
Lipopolysaccharide.

536
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,061
LPS won't just give him a fever.

537
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,096
He could hit 110. Fry his brain.

538
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,623
Or make him just toasty enough to keep
his blood flowing free, like my bowels.

539
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,293
You smell that?

540
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,268
It's not gonna get sweeter.

541
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,670
You nailed Brennan for
seeing what he wanted to see.

542
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,798
You're no different.

543
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:24,899
But you are.

544
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,534
You used to like this stuff.

545
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,808
You left here because you didn't
like what you were turning into.

546
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:30,972
Do you like who you are, now?

547
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,710
Do you like being Cuddy's errand boy?

548
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,182
That was just a courtesy
flush. I'm not actually done.

549
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,251
You want to induce a fever?
Well, unless you're willing

550
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,694
to don a white T-shirt and
hop into the hot tub with him,

551
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,197
I need another way to
keep him warm or he dies.

552
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,426
You could maim him. I could cure him.

553
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,628
I'm not letting you do it.

554
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,671
You gonna fire me?

555
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:55,866
No.

556
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,507
Wait a second. What the hell was that?

557
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,607
You were won over by
my soaring rhetoric?

558
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,846
I basically just threatened
to hold my breath.

559
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,989
You never intended to stop me.

560
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,548
You just pretended to stop me,

561
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,526
so you could pretend to fail to stop me,

562
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,892
so you could stroke my ego.

563
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,765
War doesn't end until Foreman's gone.

564
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,631
Foreman's not going anywhere.

565
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,863
And

566
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,336
I know when my Vicodin isn't Vicodin.

567
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:32,866
Do you know when your birth control
pills aren't birth control pills?

568
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,539
If we can keep your fever up,
we can get you back on dry land.

569
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,379
You feeling okay?

570
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,183
Surprisingly, yeah.

571
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,480
I feel pretty good.

572
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,424
That's not the way fevers usually work.

573
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,588
Nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to work.

574
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,824
No kidding.

575
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,423
You're giving me a fever.

576
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,870
Doctors don't give people fevers.

577
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,168
It was necessary to
keep your blood flowing.

578
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,502
Yeah.

579
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,070
It was necessary.

580
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,841
And that was all that mattered.

581
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,443
It's exciting, isn't it?

582
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,679
You're happy?

583
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,388
Why wouldn't I be?

584
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,261
Whoa. Hey. Hey. You with me?

585
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,465
I need help in here!

586
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,994
V-fib. We've got to shock
him. Get him out of the water.

587
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,094
How long's he been out?

588
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,232
Just a few seconds.

589
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,943
He's dry enough. Not yet.

590
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,210
Dry faster. Ten more seconds.

591
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,376
He'll get brain damage. He needs...

592
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,113
Kutner, you... Wait!

593
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,246
He's dry enough. Clear.

594
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,360
It worked.

595
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,258
For one of them.

596
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,830
Cardiac arrest. We were able to
shock him back to normal sinus rhythm.

597
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,601
And Kutner nearly into a coma.

598
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:16,807
So, now, you've electrocuted
yourself and set a patient on fire.

599
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,678
I like the dedication. Thank you.

600
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,375
It wasn't a compliment. Yeah, it was.

601
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,045
The insult comes now. You're insane!

602
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,383
You either have an aversion to
towels, or you want pain. I think both.

603
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,085
I'm thinking it goes
back to high school gym.

604
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,028
Anybody think we should discuss which
infection is causing the cold agglutinins

605
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,395
before they stop his heart again?

606
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,024
Sure. Why not?

607
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,869
Until they find his car we
have to assume he's traveled

608
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,432
to Ohio, California, Central
America and possibly Weehawken.

609
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,171
Nothing on the blood
cultures. Do them again.

610
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,839
Quadruple run time.

611
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:53,372
We know the infection is in
his heart. We do a biopsy.

612
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,181
If we see polys, we've got
bacterial. Lymphs, we've got viral.

613
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,712
He just had a heart attack.
Ripping out a piece might kill him.

614
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,349
Yeah.

615
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,122
We biopsy his toe instead.

616
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,027
No. That's a terrible idea.

617
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:11,262
Won't tell us anything. Biopsy
his heart. Come on. I'll join you.

618
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,438
I got you a job.

619
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,643
Mount Zion Hospital in Boston.

620
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,482
They have a great
diagnostics department.

621
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,552
Gilchrist said he'd take you, anyway.

622
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,817
That was very nice of you.

623
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,949
Oh, God. Does everything
have to be about you?

624
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,583
It's simple math.

625
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,458
I'm not gonna back down,
you're not gonna back down,

626
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,055
Cuddy's not gonna back down,
and no one's gonna be happy here.

627
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,260
And Cuddy's gonna end up pregnant.

628
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,461
What?

629
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,594
It doesn't matter.

630
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,729
Are you saying...

631
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,399
What is you having sex
with... Starts Monday.

632
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,500
I could help you pack.

633
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,511
I don't want the job.

634
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,145
Why not? You're miserable.

635
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,981
Apparently not.

636
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,987
Well, you're gonna be.

637
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,323
Are you smiling?

638
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,451
No.

639
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,355
Do your own stupid biopsy.

640
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,170
His name's Robert Elliot.
He's from Hamilton, Ohio.

641
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,940
Here's everything he had in
his trunk and his glove box.

642
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,680
No need for the heart biopsy.

643
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,622
I now know exactly who
he is and what he has.

644
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,284
You saved his life. Really?

645
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,989
No, you idiot. It's
VapoRub and lunch receipts.

646
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,555
We have his name. We could find his
doctor, get his medical records...

647
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:52,295
It's 8:00 at night. The
biopsy will be faster.

648
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,170
Not fast enough to save him,
but that's hardly the point.

649
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,373
Thirteen.

650
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,547
Is your name Thirteen?

651
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,541
Why did you volunteer
to go streetwalking?

652
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,949
I thought I could help that way.

653
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,511
A black Mormon could help that way.

654
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,887
There's no reason for
you to want to be there.

655
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,086
Which means there's a reason
you didn't want to be here.

656
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,720
Didn't want to look in the mirror?

657
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:34,370
Hi. Cuddy called. She needs
you to iron her shirts.

658
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,174
We'll take over.

659
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,246
Go ahead.

660
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,082
Talk to him.

661
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,689
You might feel a little tug
when the catheter's in the heart.

662
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,222
Come on. Make him feel comfortable.

663
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,029
I've done this procedure dozens
of times. It's completely...

664
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,468
My God.

665
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,207
You are incredibly hot.

666
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,344
I'm not here. Deal with her.

667
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,744
Are you an idiot?

668
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,475
Do you not think she's hot?

669
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,643
I'm not the alpha here.
She is. She's my boss.

670
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,584
The rash is back.

671
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,654
Increase the drip.

672
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:26,563
If you think that's
the right thing to do.

673
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,293
This is so frustrating.

674
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,660
I don't think that's me.

675
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,744
Hey.

676
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,279
Get in there. See how he's doing.

677
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,938
You were just in there.

678
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,609
Apparently, it's impossible to see
anything else when I'm in there.

679
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,585
I'm a blinding white hot light of power.

680
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,380
Got it. Pink. Good size.

681
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:55,915
Nice specimen.

682
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,392
I'm scared.

683
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,624
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

684
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,296
No.

685
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,995
No, it's not.

686
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,302
I'm not interested in how he's doing.

687
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,866
I'm interested in how she's doing.

688
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,378
So, get in there and
tell me how he's doing.

689
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,847
You think he'll mimic her
if I'm in there with her?

690
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,885
You're a powerful,
dominating man, but who knows?

691
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,613
So, I'm gonna get fired before her? Yes.

692
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:27,055
You're gonna get fired right
now unless you get in there...

693
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,819
Nothing on the biopsy.

694
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,485
And how is he?

695
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,687
His fever's at 106...

696
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,059
I know.

697
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,722
But how is he?

698
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,593
Bitter? Sexually frustrated?

699
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,896
He's delightful.

700
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,369
Loves the smell of freshly baked
rhubarb pie and isn't afraid to love.

701
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,997
Also, his rash is coming back.

702
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,010
He needs the meds and the
tub. Just to keep him stable.

703
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,204
Fine. Soak him again.

704
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,008
He'll be happy. Loves hot tubs.

705
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,015
No. You love hot tubs.

706
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,415
Find the rest of the gang. Tell
them to meet me at the lecture hall.

707
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,180
I hate hot tubs.

708
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,389
What did you say?

709
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,720
I hate... He likes.

710
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,487
Who else was in there?

711
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,531
No one.

712
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,088
You didn't think to mention that?

713
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,193
The guy likes warm, swirling water.
Didn't know that was diagnostic.

714
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,102
It's not.

715
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,903
What it is, is that water
hit him, and he had a thought.

716
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,342
Not about you, but about him.

717
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,614
We need to splash him some more.

718
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,730
Do I know you?

719
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,601
You look familiar.

720
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,907
You, too.

721
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,806
My name's Robert Elliot.

722
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,377
I'm from Hamilton, Ohio.

723
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,320
Me, too.

724
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,219
What do you do?

725
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,725
Stuff.

726
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,093
Me, too.

727
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:20,094
What brings you to New Jersey?

728
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,162
Is it work or vacation?

729
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,272
Work.

730
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,878
What type of work?

731
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,384
I'm tired.

732
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,741
I eat out a lot. A lot of restaurants.

733
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,475
The Knotty Pine,

734
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,350
Ritchies.

735
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,320
I know those places.

736
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,916
They're good, huh?

737
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,585
They're convenient.

738
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,856
For what?

739
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,124
They're on the road.

740
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,825
You on the road a lot?

741
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,164
No more than you, I suppose.

742
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,874
You ever use this stuff?

743
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,846
I use it all the time.

744
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,307
I use it all the time.

745
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,079
Yeah. I just said that.

746
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:48,390
You know, the cool thing about this
stuff is you can do a lot with it.

747
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,893
Soften your skin, you can treat scrapes,

748
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,258
naughty stuff.

749
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,279
Why did you do that?

750
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,449
Because it doesn't smell like dung.

751
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,884
You're saying you like the smell?

752
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,329
Not really.

753
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,500
It just doesn't smell like dung.

754
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,531
Something else does smell like dung?

755
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,005
Yeah.

756
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,268
Dung.

757
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,441
You guys ready?

758
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:51,585
Now is the time that you stare
at me in slack-jawed amazement.

759
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,680
He sells farm equipment.

760
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:58,593
See? Pig lagoons. Pig farms.

761
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:02,928
And as every child knows, where
you have pigs, you have pig poo.

762
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,093
But as very few children know,

763
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,764
where you have pig poo, you
have eperythrozoon infection.

764
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,603
We'll start him on clarithromycin.

765
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,769
This time tomorrow he'll
be back to his old self.

766
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,472
Whoever that might be.

767
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,208
It can wait.

768
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,044
He has a temperature of 107.

769
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,108
It can wait 15 minutes.

770
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,179
You know where Cuddy is?

771
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,793
Hi. I'm the Dean of Medicine.

772
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,524
Hi. I'm the guy who saved your life.

773
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,463
So, what if it's House?

774
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,627
Then I take the job at Mount Zion.

775
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,033
There is no job at Mount Zion.

776
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,230
House said that...

777
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,398
Well, if House said it, it must be true.

778
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:47,102
I can fire him. I can fire him
now. I can fire him tomorrow.

779
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,702
I don't even need a
reason. She doesn't fire me.

780
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,178
She never will fire
me. Because she needs...

781
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,737
He's a good doctor, that's all.

782
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,282
I respect his expertise, and I...

783
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,647
She's hot for me. Always...

784
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,845
Shut up!

785
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,757
Well, that could have been either of us.

786
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,259
You have great yabos.

787
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,266
That still could have been either of us.

788
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,764
You lose.

789
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:19,536
Seriously. I have always thought my
breasts were one of my best features.

790
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,605
Damn.

791
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,681
You all suck.

792
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:38,550
The two of you took
14 hours to find a car.

793
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,860
You forgot to mention that a
guy with no memory had memories.

794
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:48,029
If you keep on thinking that
insane guys have hidden wisdom,

795
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,438
you're gonna wind up
shooting people on a subway.

796
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,067
Something. So,

797
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,414
which one of us sucks the most?

798
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,541
It's a tie. Between?

799
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,676
All of you.

800
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,219
We're all fired?

801
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,278
None of you are fired.

802
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,165
That was nice of you.

803
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,293
Sure.

804
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,031
Why didn't you fire anyone?

805
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,834
They're good doctors. Right.

806
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,340
Why didn't you let Brennan quit?

807
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,443
He's a good doctor.

808
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,636
Right.

809
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,109
By not letting anyone go,

810
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,910
you made six people happy
and one person happy and rich.

811
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:39,183
Chase won every one of those bets. So
either you're just really nice or...

812
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,451
What's your cut?

813
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,516
Fifty percent.

814
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,925
How bad do you want to keep your job?

815
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,827
I'll keep my mouth shut.

816
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,857
Hey.

817
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:55,103
You actually do want to stay, don't you?

818
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,037
I think I do.

819
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,042
Every one of those idiots got
some insight about themselves

820
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,134
from the pig salesman,

821
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,509
but not one of them
did anything about it.

822
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:07,050
People don't learn. They
don't change. But you did.

823
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,846
You're a freak.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
