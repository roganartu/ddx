1
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,076
You like that?

2
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,046
I don't know.

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,355
You want me to use my butt again?

4
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,031
I don't know how I got here.

5
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,169
How many drinks did I have?

6
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,405
Your scotch hasn't even arrived yet.

7
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,039
Means I was drunk when I got here.

8
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,811
8:50.

9
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,714
I remember being at work.

10
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,922
I've lost at least four hours.

11
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,593
Say five words.

12
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,062
What do you mean?

13
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,894
That's four words.

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,430
The accepted diagnostic test for global
memory impairment is five random words.

15
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,128
Are you okay?

16
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,472
I'm trying to find that out.
Now, give me five animals.

17
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,305
Cat. Bird.

18
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:27,181
Monkey. Rhino. Goldfish.

19
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:33,519
Monkey. Rhino... Either
I'm massively drunk...

20
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,392
You're bleeding.

21
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,127
Or it's someone else's blood.

22
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,099
Can you see a wound?

23
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,771
How bad is it? It's all over.

24
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,644
I have concussion. Retrograde amnesia.

25
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,616
No keys, no phone, I've been mugged.

26
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,984
No, you haven't.

27
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,251
You already gave me a twenty.

28
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,382
Did you earn it?

29
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,789
Not yet.

30
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,625
Someone is going to die.

31
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,671
Kenny! Not you.

32
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,000
I saw something. A symptom.

33
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,376
Someone is going to
die unless I find them.

34
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,810
Who?

35
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,507
I have no idea.

36
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,379
Keep the change.

37
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,477
I saw somebody dying.

38
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,418
You saw 30 people flying
into glass and metal.

39
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,479
I saw a symptom before the crash.

40
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,319
You're concussed. You
don't know what you saw

41
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,517
and you don't know when you saw it.

42
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,027
A week ago, you noticed
a symptom in a soap star.

43
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,959
Bad argument, since I
was right about that.

44
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,592
But your brain obviously thinks it
happened last night. Wires are crossed.

45
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,160
That's all of it. A few stitches
will hold your brain in place.

46
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,362
Ow!

47
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,308
Hey, hold your head still unless you
want me to sew your nose onto your eye.

48
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,175
Why was I taking a bus?

49
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,679
Because you were drunk.

50
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,944
What if I saw someone and
I followed them on from

51
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,008
somewhere in Princeton?

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,553
You okay?

53
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,118
Perfect.

54
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,557
Uh...

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,485
You. Get histories
from everyone in here.

56
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,859
Did you just forget his name?

57
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,988
No.

58
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:04,360
Lesbian, find out if anybody on that
bus was taken to other hospitals.

59
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,459
You just forgot mine.

60
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,733
No, Thirteen.

61
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,070
I just wanted to call you a
lesbian. I'm not a lesbian.

62
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:14,704
I was rounding up from 50 percent.
Find my cane and motorcycle.

63
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,374
Figure out where I went last night.

64
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,085
Where's your cane and motorcycle,
and where'd you go last night?

65
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,519
You're gonna trust me?
I lie about everything.

66
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,184
You're staying the night. We need
to monitor your brain for swelling.

67
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,557
How much bigger could it get?

68
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,994
You don't think it's

69
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,693
a little weird that
there's both a giant crash

70
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,861
and a simultaneous,
mysterious symptom sighting?

71
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,370
What if it's not a coincidence?

72
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,774
You mean like the hand of God
reaching down and screwing with you?

73
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:48,210
That, or the symptom caused the crash.

74
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,218
You see anybody in a
bus driver's uniform?

75
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,197
Right here, purpura on
Lalph Klamden's neck.

76
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,625
Indicative of leukemia.

77
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,896
It caused a bleed in the
brain, hence the accident.

78
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,427
Indicative of wearing a
seatbelt. It's just a bruise.

79
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,664
I have leukemia?

80
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,299
No, we just ruled that out.

81
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,809
Pay attention. So he
probably had a seizure.

82
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,608
I didn't have a seizure. I
got hit by a garbage truck.

83
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,148
Which you drove into
while you were seizing.

84
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,810
You saw the bus driver exhibiting
the initial stages of a seizure

85
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,717
and didn't bother
telling him to pull over?

86
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,917
Hey!

87
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,652
Nobody leaves here until I
say they can be discharged.

88
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,226
She said I was... Is she me?

89
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,223
You have a fever.

90
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,766
No, I'm fine.

91
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,233
98.6.

92
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,496
I need him to stay.

93
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,471
Pulse is normal, BP's
normal, everything's normal.

94
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,905
I just have a stiff neck from the crash.

95
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,637
Stiff neck.

96
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,837
This man has meningitis.

97
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,675
We need to quarantine the whole ER.

98
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,445
No one leaves here until
their full work-up is complete.

99
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,962
You left here at 5:23 p. m.

100
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,963
Your motorcycle never made it home.

101
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:17,128
Well, that covers ten seconds out
of the four hours I can't remember.

102
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,627
Where else did you look?

103
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,365
We did pull up a list
of all the injuries.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,805
Twenty-two victims were brought here,

105
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,900
injuries ranging from a broken
pelvis to a severed right foot.

106
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:28,276
The other eight were taken
over to Princeton General.

107
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,176
Be helpful if these came
with head shots and resumes.

108
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,244
Twenty-something-year-old Jane Doe,
kidney contusion, laceration on her leg.

109
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,257
Both of which are expected complications

110
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,590
when someone goes from 60
to 0 in no seconds flat.

111
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,460
Weirdest thing we've
got is a ruptured spleen.

112
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,797
Okay, new plan. We make a list of all
the bars between here and the crash site,

113
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,497
we find out where I went,
we go there... On it.

114
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,537
You're not gonna do anything, are you?

115
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,475
We're gonna go to the
ER and do our jobs.

116
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,706
Someone's dying because
I can't remember...

117
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,282
When you remember, you can page us.

118
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,547
The shortest distance
between here and your memory

119
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,113
is straight through your pre-frontal
cortex. All we have to do is access it.

120
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,390
Great idea. I'll build the giant submarine,
you get the miniaturization gizmo.

121
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,955
Medical hypnosis can bring the
brain to a Class 2 Theta state,

122
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,024
increasing focus and memory retrieval.

123
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,399
You're not gonna make me do
the chicken dance, are you?

124
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,201
Someone in the surgical
department must be trained.

125
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,073
Just relax. Keep letting go
of any intrusive thoughts.

126
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,149
So what? You saw an ad on
the back of a comic book?

127
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,412
I did a rotation in Melbourne.

128
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,844
Focus on the sound of your breath.

129
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,981
You're taxing an already injured brain.

130
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,719
It's like telling him to walk
it off after a broken ankle.

131
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,057
Wilson is done talking now.

132
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,235
Visualize the bus.

133
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,064
The way it looked.

134
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,831
The way it smelled.

135
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,433
The people on it. What they look like.

136
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,846
This is a waste of

137
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,344
time.

138
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,387
Cool.

139
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,989
Focus on the details.

140
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,355
The bus is empty.

141
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,027
Is this really working?

142
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:34,129
Just focus. Clear your mind.
Think back to how you felt.

143
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,901
Details you saw.

144
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,071
I can't see out the windows.

145
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,447
And I can see you guys.

146
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,951
Memories further from the
incident should be clearer.

147
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,885
Where were you before
you got on the bus?

148
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,899
Why'd you get so drunk at
5:00 in the afternoon, alone?

149
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,933
I need a reason?

150
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,101
God, I hate "Beer" brand beer.

151
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,940
When he's hypnotized, can he lie?

152
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,946
He... I could be mistaken,

153
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,177
but I can't actually lie
under hypnosis. Is he lying?

154
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,275
No. What are you running away from?

155
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,584
When I'm drinking, without you,
what am I running away from?

156
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,819
One of those imponderables. Can
we hold off on your insecurities

157
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,518
until we find this patient?

158
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,755
Do you see anyone in the bar?

159
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:38,533
I see a faceless crowd. How do I
focus? Say something to make me focus.

160
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,971
He's concerned about you. Why
does that mean he's insecure?

161
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,370
Get your girlfriend out of here.

162
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,843
It's a legit question. Amber's there?

163
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,208
You've got Amber in your head?

164
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,612
You put her in my head.

165
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,413
I can't even have a conversation
with you in my subconscious

166
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,953
without her tagging along.

167
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,682
She'd better have her clothes on.

168
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,280
Unfortunately.

169
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,359
I didn't mean to say that out loud.

170
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,450
Say what out loud?

171
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,463
I didn't say it out loud?

172
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,556
Nothing.

173
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,328
What's going on in there?

174
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,200
If I can't lie, I need
these two out of here.

175
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:16,638
Let's just ignore Wilson and
Amber from now on, shall we?

176
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,643
I wish it were that...

177
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,645
That's some program they've got
down there in Melbourne. Cheers.

178
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,012
I remember the bartender. Good.

179
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,889
Now you're accessing your temporal lobe.

180
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,928
Does the bartender
have any odd symptoms?

181
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,726
No, he seems fine.

182
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,692
Is anybody here sick?
Anyone here taking the bus?

183
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,066
You are.

184
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,939
Because you took my keys.

185
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,034
Good. This is good. Now
we can retrace your steps.

186
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,541
Let's go back to the bus.

187
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,440
What's in front of you? Passengers.

188
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,880
Anything special about them?

189
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,393
Some Emo guitar hero wannabe.

190
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,899
You're focusing on him. Why?

191
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,267
Because nose picking
could mean nasal pruritus.

192
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,703
He's dying.

193
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,876
You a nose picker?
Do I have to answer...

194
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,434
If the answer was no,
you would have answered.

195
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,534
Tilt your head back.

196
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,637
He's fine.

197
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,272
Doesn't even have meningitis.

198
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,408
Just like everybody else we've
had to give meningitis shots to.

199
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,612
You can go.

200
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,120
You have a brain tumor.

201
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,482
You're kidding, right?

202
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,219
If I was kidding, I'd
be dressed like you.

203
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,091
You're fine. A nurse will sign you out.

204
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,393
Go home, have fun, relax.
I'm probably just a nut case.

205
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,967
Tilt your head back.

206
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,943
Get your things and go.

207
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,949
You need to rest. I'm admitting you.

208
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,358
I can't get up!

209
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,459
I can't move my legs!

210
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,473
Your legs are not your biggest problem.

211
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,943
Your biggest problem is I don't
know what your biggest problem is.

212
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,446
So, we have the who but not the what.

213
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,286
We've only got one symptom to go on.

214
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,053
Sudden onset paralysis.

215
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,424
We actually have two symptoms.

216
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,995
Only one that we remember.

217
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,587
You did a full work-up on the guy.

218
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,360
Did you find anything? CT
ruled out subdural hematoma,

219
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,026
stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

220
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,933
Guillain-Barré fits.

221
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,632
Just trying to figure out
what Guillain-Barré looks like.

222
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,403
You can't just eliminate everything

223
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,445
because it doesn't match
what you might have seen.

224
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,639
How about because it doesn't
match what I could have seen?

225
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,979
Guillain-Barré has no external
physical manifestations.

226
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,111
Everything has some external
physical manifestations.

227
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,087
And you're obsessive enough
to notice any of them.

228
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,488
Which means there's
nothing we can rule out.

229
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,254
Elevated white count.
Means transverse myelitis...

230
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,989
Sudden paralysis while driving a bus.

231
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,792
That's the sort of subtle clue that
only a genius would have noticed.

232
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,770
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

233
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,178
Where are you going?

234
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,846
To smell a bus. Obviously.

235
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,524
Yeah, I'll start him on antibiotics
in case it's transverse myelitis.

236
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,359
You guys go sniff a city bus.

237
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,338
Why are you smelling
the passengers' clothes?

238
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:11,102
Smell is the most powerful
evokerater of memory.

239
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,208
I need to get back on that bus.

240
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,780
Okay. So why are you
taking so much Vicodin?

241
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,443
If Cuddy asks, blocking the
pain helps focus the memory.

242
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:23,318
You split your head
open. You should rest.

243
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,222
Anything? Hint of

244
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,990
exploded bus.

245
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,292
House, that's four Vicodin in
forty seconds. At this rate...

246
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,858
Wish me luck.

247
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,065
I'm going in, Rambo style.

248
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,201
House, do you think this is gonna
work, or are you just stoned?

249
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,276
Both, apparently.

250
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,376
You're wrong. It's not working.

251
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,887
So you're saying I'm not here?

252
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,255
If it was a real memory, you'd be
limping and you wouldn't be talking to me.

253
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,691
I'm obviously a hallucination.

254
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,756
Okay, so I went a little
heavy on the Vicodin.

255
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:09,459
Better hope so. 'Cause otherwise,
means your brain's bleeding.

256
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,628
We're both in my head. You'd think
one of us would have noticed the blood.

257
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,296
Why haven't you had a head CT yet?

258
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,307
Who do you want me to treat? Me
or you? Did you have a seizure?

259
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,936
Dumb question. The brain's too fried
during a seizure to form memories.

260
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,708
Dumb answer. I wasn't
asking you, I was asking me,

261
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,306
because you've already
proven that you're not here.

262
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,884
I'm getting a headache. Is that a clue?

263
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,944
Again, I'm not here.
You're getting a headache.

264
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,582
Stop arguing with a hallucination
and get some treatment.

265
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,990
He can't.

266
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,725
The hallucination is your messed-up
brain's way of reasoning out a problem.

267
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,700
You weren't on the bus.

268
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,902
How do you know?

269
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:50,408
Five-hundred-dollar shoes? Not
on the Princeton cross-town.

270
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,001
Must be another reason why I'm here.

271
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,275
Yes. What do you have to tell me?

272
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,646
I was talking to the
passengers on the bus.

273
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,450
You were hallucinating.
You're getting an MRI.

274
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,651
<i>Stop fidgeting.</i>

275
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,921
If you haven't found the
bleed yet, it can't be...

276
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,332
There's edema and localized swelling
in the section of the temporal lobe

277
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,131
that controls short-term memory.

278
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,264
<i>Also, the penis size cortex
is set to "pathetic. "</i>

279
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,968
What didn't you say out loud?

280
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,238
Very little.

281
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,778
<i>When you were under hypnosis,</i>

282
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,474
you were talking to Amber.

283
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,011
I wanted to see her naked.

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,688
Seriously, what were you hiding?

285
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,017
I want to see her naked.

286
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,523
You want to see everyone
naked. Why would you hide that?

287
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,827
Some guys get upset when you
objectify their girlfriends.

288
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,458
But if you're okay, I got a
digital video camera, so we could...

289
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,468
<i>Why would I be upset that
you're treating my girlfriend</i>

290
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,265
<i>like you treat every
other woman on the planet?</i>

291
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,238
Unless you're not.

292
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,371
<i>Unless it's deeper than that.</i>

293
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,311
You weren't objectifying her.

294
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:09,481
Trust me, I want to do some very nasty,
demeaning stuff to your girlfriend.

295
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,419
You have feelings for her.

296
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,594
This is bad.

297
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,227
It's a longitudinal fracture
of the temporal bone.

298
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,892
I banged my head.

299
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,936
This isn't just a boo-boo.

300
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,666
I'll rest once I figure out
what's wrong with this guy.

301
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,038
Why? Why this guy?

302
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,169
You want patients with
weird, undiagnosed symptoms?

303
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,305
You get five files like that
on your desk every morning.

304
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,111
And you'd never risk your life for them.

305
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,319
Why is this guy so special that all
of a sudden you've become Batman?

306
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,481
I don't know.

307
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,118
Maybe it's because you have a
cracked skull and you're not yourself.

308
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,924
Go home, go to sleep.

309
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,395
My legs are holding.

310
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,668
Good. Now put all your
weight on your right leg.

311
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,008
The antibiotics are working. It's TM.

312
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,170
It's 2:00 in the morning.

313
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,942
You should be home resting
what's left of your bruised brain.

314
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,244
Recovery's too fast.

315
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,376
What, the fact that he's getting
better is evidence that we're wrong?

316
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,283
I need to sit.

317
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,289
Recovery slow enough for you now?

318
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,518
It's my stomach.

319
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,355
Which means it's not tranverse myelitis.

320
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,429
Rapid onset, could
be a perforated ulcer.

321
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,727
Wouldn't explain the paralysis.

322
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,294
Addison's. From a tumor.

323
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,769
It's possible that I
saw his eyelids droop.

324
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,169
We've scanned his head five times.

325
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,102
You're bleeding.

326
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,609
Little thing called a bus crash.

327
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,114
Just a scalp laceration. It could
be hidden in his optic chiasm.

328
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,978
It's coming from your ear.

329
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,617
Think that's a good thing?

330
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,854
But that would have
affected his eyesight.

331
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,856
I need to take a bath.

332
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,625
Hallucinations and smells were kind
of working, right? Why the bath?

333
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,689
Hypnosis gave me the nose picker.
Smells set off hallucinations.

334
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:39,531
Sensory deprivation should get the
brain into an alpha-theta phase.

335
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,196
<i>Didn't you see Altered States?</i>

336
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,638
I don't think I was even
born when that movie was out.

337
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,076
Then you're too young to be a doctor.
That movie was released in 1980.

338
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,339
That was 28 years ago.

339
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,778
No it wasn't. Shut up.

340
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,373
Did you just forget what year it is?

341
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,044
No, I just remembered how old I am.

342
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,589
I need to give my brain time to transition
so I can embrace my inner monkey.

343
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,555
Or maybe I don't. Get
me some physostigmine.

344
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,890
It crosses the blood-brain barrier.

345
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,023
And act like a nerve gas, stop your heart,
you'll go to heaven and be omniscient.

346
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,830
Good idea. Not gonna happen.

347
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:15,896
Don't do anything. Even if I escape,
eat a goat or get shot by police.

348
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,171
"Wasn't born yet" means I won't be
entertained by further reference.

349
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,786
I didn't know you rode the bus.

350
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:36,216
I used to drive home after getting
drunk, but some mothers got mad-d.

351
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,423
What are you doing here? You
weren't on the bus with me.

352
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:45,094
Then I guess this isn't
a memory. It's a fantasy.

353
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,098
If it's a fantasy,
you'd be wearing this.

354
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,772
You're convinced your patient is dying

355
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,280
and you wanna waste your
time with a sex fantasy?

356
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,249
Don't blame me, blame my gender.

357
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,649
Well, I'm not here to indulge that.

358
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,777
I'm here to help you figure
out what symptom you saw.

359
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,913
Your patient was driving the
bus, so all you could see...

360
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,924
Why can't you do both?

361
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:19,630
Your patient was driving the bus, so
all you could see was him sitting down,

362
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,798
most likely facing forward.

363
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,113
From behind I saw his earlobes
wiggling, or his head bobbing.

364
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,361
But not that.

365
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,488
Could indicate aortic insufficiency.

366
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,065
Marfan's syndrome. Or syphilis.

367
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,998
What if his earlobes were just drooping?

368
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,543
Ehlers-Danlos?

369
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,839
Or Cutis Laxa.

370
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,141
It's not fatal in adults.

371
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:12,045
Yes, he's an adult, very
good point, keep going.

372
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,488
I'm distracting you.

373
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,293
No!

374
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,194
Dance, woman.

375
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,566
You'd rather be diagnosing.

376
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,501
I screamed no.

377
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,040
And your own subconscious ignored you.

378
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,077
Because you'd rather fantasize
about finding symptoms.

379
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,703
How screwed up is that?

380
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,477
Hey, over here. Remember me?

381
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,345
I'm the sick guy.

382
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,644
Tell me what I saw.

383
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,418
Was it the blood dripping from my ear?

384
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,991
That doesn't make sense because
your shirt wasn't stained.

385
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,057
And because that was me.

386
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:03,364
I could have had a subtle hemiballismus,
indicating the early stages of Huntington's.

387
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,275
Huntington's wouldn't
explain the abdominal pain,

388
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,505
and it's only on the table
because we're thinking of Thirteen.

389
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,572
A shuffling gait could
suggest Parkinson's.

390
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,742
Except there's no such thing
as "shuffling sitting. "

391
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,015
He moved when he helped
the old lady up the steps.

392
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,149
Who are you?

393
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,718
I'm the answer. Look.

394
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,588
At what?

395
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,256
Here.

396
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,573
You were right.

397
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,484
Help him up.

398
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,080
I got it, it's Parkinson's.

399
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,182
House. Your ear.

400
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,385
Start him on levodopa.

401
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,927
You should sit down.

402
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,485
House!

403
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,237
Get that out of my face.

404
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,910
Welcome back. I'm Nurse Dickerson.

405
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,416
I don't need your name.

406
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,351
And I got your profession from
your super competent technique

407
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,614
of melting my retinas.

408
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,590
Verbal faculties seem to be
intact. Do you remember passing out?

409
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,355
I remember puking on Cuddy's shoes.

410
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,664
Yeah, skull fractures tend to hurt.

411
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,825
Would hurt a lot less if you
hadn't swiped my pain pills.

412
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,096
Dr. Cuddy's orders. Wants me
to regulate the amount of...

413
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,434
Wait a second. You brought muscle?

414
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,303
Dr. Cuddy's orders.

415
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:50,804
Means I was wrong. My patient
doesn't have Parkinson's.

416
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,080
Cuddy knows that's the only
reason I wouldn't want to stay here

417
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,087
with my pain pills,
porn and you forever.

418
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,955
Vomiting means your brain
injury is getting worse.

419
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,351
House's skull fracture extends
all the way down to his ear canal.

420
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,363
House is being looked after.
Our other patient has jaundice,

421
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,831
low albumin and no
diagnosis. Wilson's Disease.

422
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,960
Thank you. But Wilson's
wouldn't explain...

423
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,608
Foreman. How did you
eliminate Parkinson's?

424
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,440
Tests confirm the abdominal
pain was caused by liver failure.

425
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,345
I assume you've already ruled
out hepatitis and Wilson's.

426
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,847
You should really be resting.

427
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,214
Give him five minutes.
Brainstorming a few possibilities

428
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,514
<i>isn't going to explode his
brain. And if she's wrong,</i>

429
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,521
that makes this phone call
that much more exciting.

430
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,954
<i>What about hepatic fibrosis?</i>

431
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,457
Can't be, his Alk phos was normal.

432
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,551
Could be thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.

433
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,129
Did I mention this diagnosis
needs to make sense?

434
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,461
Why doesn't it make
sense? Bus driver's Asian.

435
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,898
His potassium's slightly low.

436
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,730
If he got paralyzed
while driving the bus,

437
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,736
don't you think I would have
gotten off at the next stop?

438
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,830
Not if the next stop was at
a 90-degree angle into an SUV.

439
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,808
The bus would have
slowed, I would've noticed.

440
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,002
Phone call's over.

441
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:56,741
TPP has all the confirmed symptoms.
There's no downside to testing.

442
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:01,148
Genetic test is too
slow. Run the bagel test.

443
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,049
How many more bagels do I
have to eat for this to work?

444
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:09,217
High carbs plus exercise is
the quickest way to confirm TPP.

445
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:13,229
I've been on this for half an
hour. I'm not gonna collapse again.

446
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,492
Up the speed. Keep eating.

447
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,770
<i>Yeah. So the carbo-loading marathon</i>

448
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,101
<i>isn't working.</i>

449
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,073
<i>Stop looking around suspiciously.</i>

450
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,575
To answer your next two questions,

451
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:30,239
no, I am not there, and yes,
you are completely predictable.

452
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,838
<i>If the test had worked,
you would have called</i>

453
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,611
<i>to put my delicate brain at ease.</i>

454
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,118
I told you not to lock the door.

455
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,952
Still wiping.

456
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,753
Put the phone up to bus driver's grill.

457
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,595
Who are you talking to?

458
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,226
My large colon.

459
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,899
TPP's not consistent with your
patient's labored breathing.

460
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,202
Patient has labored breathing

461
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,266
because he's been on a treadmill
for the last thirty minutes.

462
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,470
Did you take my cell phone?

463
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,207
My large colon did. I'm
negotiating its release.

464
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:07,879
<i>Help.</i>

465
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:08,976
What's happening?

466
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:13,056
<i>The test worked. He collapsed.</i>

467
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,617
You're half right.
He's wheezing, isn't he?

468
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,990
Yeah.

469
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:22,125
Can't wheeze without moving your
chest muscles. This isn't TPP.

470
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,222
Then what is it?

471
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,394
How am I supposed to
know? I'm not there.

472
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,773
Right heart strain. He's
still not oxygenating.

473
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,142
Must be a pulmonary embolism.

474
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,910
So why haven't you pushed a vial of tPA?

475
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,042
You let him back in?
I asked him back in.

476
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,282
At the tail end of me patiently
explaining how you idiots were idiots.

477
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,788
Pushed tPA 10 minutes ago.

478
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,517
That means it's not a
clot. Has to be a clot.

479
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,254
If he had a bagel stuck in his windpipe,
I would have seen it on the echo.

480
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,885
Get him to the OR to suck it out.

481
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,022
Must have just screwed
up the intubation.

482
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,290
Seal's good.

483
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,891
It's a clot, House.

484
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,262
Wait, wait.

485
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,031
Look at his teeth.

486
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,271
He's got shiny new caps. He's
had recent dental surgery.

487
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:10,279
You can tell us what that means
while we're rolling him to the OR.

488
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,151
House! House!

489
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,449
House!

490
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,619
Get a syringe.

491
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,961
I didn't bring you back here
so you could stage a coup.

492
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:31,226
Listen to me. Dental air drill
pushed an air bubble into his gums.

493
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,827
Dislodged while he's driving.
Caused a myoclonic jerk.

494
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,338
That's what I must have
seen. Then it hit his spine,

495
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,840
his liver, and now his lungs.

496
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,603
Dr. Hadley, open the door.

497
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,406
I'm not plumping his pillows here,

498
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,647
I'm putting him in the
Trendelenburg position,

499
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,272
move the bubble to the apex of his heart

500
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,147
so you can suck it out.
Now get the damn syringe.

501
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:51,313
I can't risk you stabbing him in the heart
looking for an unconfirmed air bubble.

502
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:52,582
Stab him.

503
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,648
Dr. Hadley! See? She
doesn't even know your name.

504
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,624
Stab his heart!

505
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:57,786
Sats at 75.

506
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,193
Yes, he's suffocating.
If you're wrong...

507
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,755
Shut up and make a decision. Keep
standing there, he's dead either way.

508
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,199
Dr. Hadley!

509
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,867
I'm sorry.

510
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,528
Open that door.

511
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,312
Don't shoot! Get him to the OR.

512
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,877
The O2 sats.

513
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,183
It was an air bubble. He's okay.

514
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,528
The other nurse always
used to tuck me in.

515
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,297
I'll be on the couch,

516
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,700
with a shotgun in my lap.

517
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,829
Worrying about me.

518
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,874
Making sure you don't try and
make a limp for the border.

519
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,533
Get some sleep.

520
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,337
I'm not sleepy, Mommy.

521
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,844
Me neither.

522
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,746
Who are you? And why
are you stalking me?

523
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,978
Technically, you're stalking me.

524
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,544
What is that?

525
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,883
A mosquito?

526
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,690
Maybe just a fly.

527
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,326
In the ointment.

528
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,427
So there's something wrong,

529
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:50,364
there's some detail I'm not noticing
that's spoiling the big picture.

530
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:03,920
Is this significant? Or is this dream
just going in a different direction now?

531
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,751
Guess that depends.

532
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,785
What are you going to do with that?

533
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,029
I have to tie this around you.

534
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,982
I'm cold.

535
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,044
Stay with me.

536
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,289
Why did I say that?

537
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,981
Hey. Go away.

538
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,640
It's not over.

539
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,844
I saved the wrong person.

540
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:21,324
This wasn't just a dream, or a fantasy,
or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland.

541
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,866
So the bus driver with the air
bubble was just a coincidence.

542
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,029
No. I got the causation flipped.
The bubble didn't cause the crash.

543
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,335
The crash caused the bubble to dislodge.

544
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,739
There was no myoclonic
jerk. I saw something else

545
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,935
in someone else.

546
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,410
You're not leaving.

547
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,742
What's the most dangerous
thing a patient could do

548
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,282
when his brain is on
the brink of herniating?

549
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:44,788
Elevated heart rate, BP, which
is exactly why you need to stop.

550
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,187
Instead of sleeping, I'm going to
be pacing around this apartment,

551
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,055
trying to decipher those visions.

552
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,822
Why does this matter so much?

553
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,226
I don't know.

554
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,796
Heart rate?

555
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,867
127. BP?

556
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,203
Contextual memory, I need to get back
on that bus with all 31 passengers

557
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,104
to remember who and what I saw.

558
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,803
I'm not gonna call in crash
victims because you've gone insane.

559
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,446
Maybe I don't need the actual victims.

560
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,310
Who's playing Anne McKeon? Right here.

561
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,215
Jane Doe #2 from Princeton
General? Right here.

562
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,348
You, too, that's right.

563
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,758
Goth Kid, at the back, on the right.

564
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,428
Yeah, here.

565
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,027
Okay.

566
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,897
You think that staring
at pictures on our shirts

567
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,460
is going to be more
effective than hypnosis?

568
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,372
If you'd stop talking, the re-enactment
could stimulate activity in my hippocampus

569
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,468
and parahippocampal cortex.

570
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,671
How long do we have to sit here

571
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,941
before you are stimulated?

572
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,211
Stop staring at my breasts.

573
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,619
And don't say, "Or lack thereof. "

574
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:56,957
You okay?

575
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,430
What did you see?

576
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,736
Just slipped away.

577
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,767
Is that Vicodin?

578
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,473
No, just a little
memory pick-me-up.

579
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,138
Physostigmine?

580
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,775
Are you crazy?

581
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,412
Alzheimer drugs will make
your brain go into overdrive.

582
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:27,117
That's the point. It'll
speed up my neuronal firing,

583
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,419
turn up the voltage on my memory.

584
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,824
And blow out your heart.

585
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,326
How many did you take?

586
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,364
Just now, or including the
ones I took on the ride over?

587
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,528
<i>House, this isn't worth...</i>

588
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,806
House?

589
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,813
Why are you here?

590
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:00,153
You believe in reason above all
else. There must be a reason.

591
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,320
You have something to tell me.

592
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,452
Yes. Who am I?

593
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,431
That's asking, not telling. Who are you?

594
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,057
You know who I am.

595
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:15,536
If I did, I'd be passed out in bed
instead of OD'ing on physostigmine

596
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,471
on the 6th Street cross-town.

597
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,703
What's my necklace made of?

598
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,612
Resin. Who am I?

599
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,174
I don't know.

600
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,621
Why the guessing game?

601
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,987
Because you don't know the answer.

602
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,485
And if I don't, you don't.

603
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,162
But you know the clues.

604
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,927
I know what's bugging your subconscious.

605
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,595
What's my necklace made of?

606
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,101
No.

607
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,843
Who am I?

608
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,916
It doesn't make sense.

609
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,214
What's my necklace made of?

610
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,688
Amber.

611
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,115
I have to tie this around you.

612
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,419
I'm cold.

613
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,525
Stay with me.

614
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,960
Just stay with me.

615
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,589
Sir, are you all right?

616
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,756
Are you all right?

617
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,362
Are you injured anywhere?

618
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,899
They'll take care of you over there.

619
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,488
He's coming out of it. Strong pulse.

620
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,224
You idiot! Your heart stopped!

621
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,660
Amber.

622
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,601
What? Amber.

623
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,074
It was Amber.

624
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,607
She was on the bus.

625
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,139
You almost kill yourself, and all
we're getting is drug-induced fantasies.

626
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,878
Have you spoken to her?

627
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,979
She's probably working,
she's been on-call.

628
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,424
I called her. She didn't call...

629
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,132
How could she... I don't know.

630
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,472
Jane Doe #2.

631
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:31,310
Female, late 20s, kidney damage.

632
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,407
Does Amber have a birthmark
on her right shoulder blade?

633
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,951
She was on the bus with me.

634
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,625
She's the one who's dying.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
