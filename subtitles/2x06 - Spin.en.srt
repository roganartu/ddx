00:00:02,107 --> 00:00:06,244
Announcer:
<i>As the riders begin lap two,
Jeff Forster's leading the pack.</i>

2
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:12,390
This is so cool.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,572
Did we miss anything?

4
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:15,792
They've got like 11 laps to go.

5
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:18,901
We gotta find a good place
where he can see the sign
when he goes by.

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,175
Wait up, kids!

7
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:33,778
Turn six. Come on!

8
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:35,700
[Wheezes]

9
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:48,372
[Panting]

10
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,510
That's it, up there.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,392
Can you see anything?

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,335
[Wheezes]

13
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:58,568
Did you bring his inhaler?

14
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:01,279
Oh, crap.
I think it's in the car.

15
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:02,781
I'll go get it.

16
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:06,758
[Panting]

17
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:09,453
[Wheezes]

18
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,472
Are you okay?

19
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:12,894
- Your dad's gonna be right back.
- I can see him. He's right up front.

20
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:14,390
Honey, you're wheezing.

21
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,185
- Here they come!
- Go, Jeff, yeah!

22
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:18,806
You're number one!

23
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,168
He doesn't look so good.

24
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:41,403
2x06 - Spin

25
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,779
Original Airdate (FOX): 15-NOV-2005

26
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:10,951
[Yawns]

27
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:21,047
Yeah!

28
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,749
We need to talk.

29
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,138
Oh, God.
Are you pregnant?

30
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:28,351
Because I really want to
finish high school.

31
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:30,695
You have to
renew your credential.

32
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:32,312
They're good
for two more months.

33
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:34,411
Three weeks, and
the paperwork takes forever.

34
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:35,800
Your application.

35
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,405
Your malpractice insurance.

36
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:38,556
Criminal records check.

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,448
And you know that's gonna
take some explaining.

38
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:43,850
You know,
our relationship was way better
when we were sleeping together.

39
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:45,809
Why did we stop doing that?
Did you get married?

40
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:49,128
Yeah. Otherwise
I'd be on you like red on rice.

41
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,647
Rice isn't...
Oh, I get it.

42
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:53,494
You're also behind
on your dictations.

43
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:54,962
I don't do dictations.

44
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:56,528
Cameron does them.
Or somebody.

45
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:59,945
You can't have your
sole female employee
doing your clerical work,

46
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:03,044
which you'd know
if you'd attended the required
sexual harassment seminars.

47
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:05,879
Now I'm gonna pause
so you can make a crack
about harassment.

48
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:07,219
Joke killer.

49
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,234
Cuddy:
House.

50
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,924
Got a patient.

51
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,588
[sighs] Sorry.

52
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:14,375
Can't play anymore.
My mom's calling me.

53
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:20,191
- We just admitted a world-class cyclist.
- You've gotta fire Stacy.

54
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:21,550
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

55
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:23,023
Jeff Forster.

56
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,960
Respiratory arrest
at 30 miles per hour.

57
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:27,657
She's loading me up
with pointless paperwork.

58
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,798
Well, you're way behind
on your pointless paperwork.

59
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:32,296
- O2 stats are in the...
- She's hostile.

60
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,184
You know me. Hostility
makes me shrink up like a...

61
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
I can't think of
a non-sexual metaphor.

62
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,809
She's gonna stand over my desk
with a ruler checking my spelling.

63
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:42,886
ER checked for lung infiltrates.
Nothing there.

64
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,739
Professional athletes, Cuddy.

65
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:48,538
It's like watching
an old movie at 2:00 a.m.
Reliving all the classic moments.

66
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:51,178
The part where
he denies it's drugs.

67
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:55,232
The part where the good guys
ride in tests a'blazing,
prove that it is drugs.

68
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:58,823
Oscar clip. He can't imagine
how they got into his body.

69
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:00,704
It's so familiar,
so comforting.

70
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:02,364
She can't handle
working with me.

71
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:04,013
[Elevator dings]
Oh, right. Yeah.

72
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:06,692
She's still got a thing to you,
making it impossible for her to deal.

73
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:09,009
Makes perfect sense.
Except for the pronouns.

74
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:11,735
Anyway, thanks for
getting me out of that meeting.

75
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:15,341
He's not denying the drugs.

76
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,522
I'm thinking
he's actually sick.

77
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:28,336
- Jeff Forster, this is...
- I'm a doctor.

78
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,906
You're a sick person.

79
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,758
And you...are a loved one.

80
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:35,067
Actually, manager.
We've been together
for seven years.

81
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:38,173
So what's the drug du jour
on the bike circuit these days?

82
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:41,506
Still erythropoietin?
Or you guys just
chugging battery acid?

83
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:43,602
There's no way
I'd touch EPO. [Gasps (<)]

84
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:46,317
Too many guys
stroking out (<) and dying.

85
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,535
Damn!

86
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,094
Ten bucks for the ticket,
six for the popcorn.

87
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,011
I do straight blood doping.

88
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:53,573
Plot twist.

89
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:56,375
That's a very
daring confession.

90
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,188
We've got
confidentiality, right?

91
00:04:58,251 --> 00:05:00,812
Assuming
I'm more ethical
than your client.

92
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:06,003
So, injecting yourself
with donor red blood cells
for fun and profit.

93
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:08,095
Any other tricks
up your sleeve?

94
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:10,087
Well, nothing
much recently. (<)

95
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:13,138
I'm in town for a charity ride,
so it didn't matter if I won. (<)

96
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:14,902
The kids just needed to see me.

97
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:17,302
If you go slower,
they see you longer.

98
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:21,732
Let's say that our health
could be affected by things
we did before last Friday.

99
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:24,011
[Gasps (<)] Well...

100
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:28,664
Um, I usually sleep
in a hyperbaric chamber. (<)

101
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:32,027
I've been pumping up
electrolytes with an IV drip.

102
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:36,709
Anabolic herbal supplements,
amphetamines, (<) and diuretics.

103
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,048
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:39,453
But why would you be sick?

105
00:05:39,537 --> 00:05:41,643
I know that
doping has risks. (<)

106
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:44,065
I know that
it's outside the rules. (<)

107
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:48,214
But I do what I have to
to kick ass (<) at my job. (<)

108
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,245
Don't you?

109
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:53,638
Dr. House is a firm believer
in good old-fashioned hard work.

110
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,947
Ahhh.

111
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:59,266
This guy doesn't even get sick
like a regular person.

112
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,691
Instead of a list of symptoms
and no cause, we have a list of
possible causes for one symptom.

113
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:06,257
Chase:
Is the symptom death?

114
00:06:06,445 --> 00:06:08,061
Respiratory distress.

115
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:10,672
And insanity doesn't cause it.
I looked it up.

116
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:11,885
It's the doping.

117
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:15,801
Injecting extra red cells
boosts your endurance level,
but it also thickens your blood.

118
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:18,246
Thick blood equals clots
equals respiratory distress.

119
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,453
Not with a
clean spiral chest CT.

120
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:21,973
Guy's sleeping
in an hyperbaric chamber.

121
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:25,236
Over-oxygenation can cause
cell damage, and if the cells
in the lungs are damaged...

122
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,685
That'd cause pulmonary edema,
which he doesn't have.

123
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:31,871
The supplements
he's been taking contain yohimbe,
which can cause nerve paralysis.

124
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:33,574
Tox screen was normal.

125
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:34,868
All the tests were normal.

126
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:38,753
There's no clot, no edema,
and yet he still can't breathe.

127
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:41,462
So there's something
in here that we can't see.

128
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,867
Oh. Air.

129
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:47,240
Come to papa.

130
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:49,629
This guy's been
injecting himself
how many times a day?

131
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,198
All it'd take is
one slip of the needle
to cause an air embolus.

132
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:54,127
So air is keeping him
from breathing air.

133
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:55,873
Let's go with that
for the irony.

134
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,902
Get a VQ scan and
check his veins for bubbles.

135
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:05,595
Xenon 133.

136
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,952
<i>It's just radioactive
enough for us to track
the air moving through your lungs.</i>

137
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,679
My accident on the news?

138
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,570
Yeah. You made
plays of the week.

139
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,983
Few more of those and cycling
will be as popular as NASCAR.

140
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:20,635
We inject similar stuff
into your blood so
we can watch it circulate.

141
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:26,155
Now if you accidentally
injected a bubble, we'll see
good air flow but poor blood flow.

142
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,776
- Un-huh. I'm careful, man.
- [Foreman laughs]

143
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:31,168
With all due respect, man, ...

144
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:35,188
I doubt there's
anything wrong with you
that you didn't do to yourself.

145
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:41,290
There's this kid in oncology.
She's got a picture of Jeff
above her bed.

146
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:44,902
Mickey Mantle
was an alcoholic.

147
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,245
Cameron:
At least he hit his own home runs.

148
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:48,170
He didn't physically alter himself.

149
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:51,035
We take drugs to help us
fall asleep, to stay awake.

150
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:53,369
We don't make careers out of
who can stay awake the longest.

151
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:56,865
Really? Ever been to, oh,
I don't know, med school?

152
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,069
Uh, guys, he plays a game
for a living. Who cares?

153
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,647
You don't even like sports.

154
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,058
He's making
millions of dollars
ripping off fans.

155
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:06,245
Anyone who thinks
they should pay a guy money

156
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:10,116
because he can throw a ball
really far, or pedal really fast
deserves to be ripped off.

157
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,216
Yeah, stupid, stupid kids.

158
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,056
I've got an uncle.
He can spit a cherry pit 50 yards.

159
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,005
He's working part-time
at a lube shop. Life isn't fair.

160
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:20,538
[Scanner bleeps and stops]

161
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,362
Maybe it is.

162
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:26,025
Chase:
You were right.

163
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:28,729
Now there went
three wasted words.

164
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:30,255
There is a bubble in his lung.

165
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,607
We should do a
Swan-Ganz catheterization.

166
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:34,825
I love when you do
both sides of the conversation.

167
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,755
It's like white noise.
It's very peaceful.

168
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,049
Is there a light somewhere
that goes on when I have food?

169
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:54,278
Green for food,
orange for beverages,
red for impure thoughts.

170
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:56,711
That bulb burns out
every two weeks.

171
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,079
How's your biker?

172
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,606
Pumped an air bubble
into a vein in his lung.

173
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,175
The things people do.

174
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,747
Doping. Vicodin.

175
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,467
Hey. You're talking
about me, aren't you?

176
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:11,251
I'm just trying to function.
He's trying to win himself
some little yellow jerseys.

177
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,228
- Uh-oh.
- What?

178
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:16,941
Trouble in paradise,
two o'clock.

179
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,993
Your two o'clock
or my two o'clock?

180
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,462
There.

181
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:27,266
She seems perfectly happy.

182
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,262
Obviously, they huddled in the hall
and worked up this circus act
on the off-chance you'd be in here.

183
00:09:31,346 --> 00:09:33,445
She was unbelievably
pissy three hours ago.

184
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,082
Hmm. Pissy with you.
Happy with her husband.

185
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,342
Yes, there could only be
one possible explanation for that.

186
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:41,769
When she's angry,
she gets sarcastic.

187
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,511
When's she annoyed,
she's funny.

188
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:45,238
But when she's frustrated,
she gets pissy.

189
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:47,114
Yes, yes, I'm with you so far.

190
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:50,475
She's miserable with Mark
because he's not me.

191
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,518
So she's gotta make me not me,
so she makes my professional life
miserable. If I can't do my job...

192
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:56,941
You really, really
need to get some.

193
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,140
Oh, I get some "some"
all the time.

194
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,974
That's why I always
need to borrow some money.

195
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:04,423
Stacy:
Hi, James.

196
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:07,239
Greg.
Gotten to that paperwork?

197
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:09,824
- I've been pissy.
- Pardon me?

198
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,442
I've been busy.

199
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,592
When you save someone's life,
they owe you forever.

200
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,128
You're right. Take Stacy.

201
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:20,355
Oh, wait. She'd probably
just leave you all over again.

202
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:21,696
House:
How's your recovery going?

203
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,702
Gotten around to
the small muscles yet?

204
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:25,416
It's not the size of the muscle.

205
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,079
It's where you get to put it.

206
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:31,772
My goodness. It's like watching
Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward
in the third grade.

207
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,456
Excuse us.

208
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:39,423
How awkward was that?

209
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:42,925
What's he doing here anyway?
He's got physio Tuesdays and Fridays.

210
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,756
Uh, Mark is in group therapy
for people coping with disability.

211
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,629
He was thinking about
developing a drug addiction,
but that would be stupid.

212
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:53,263
Hey, you're...you again.

213
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:58,509
Not gonna make some joke
about Mark being in therapy?

214
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:00,695
What's there to say?

215
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:03,257
He's doing the responsible thing.

216
00:11:04,684 --> 00:11:06,887
I'm sure he's got
a lot to deal with.

217
00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:08,772
You're making me nervous.

218
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:15,629
[Moira on phone]
Every time an athlete goes down,
you guys assume it's drugs.

219
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:19,572
Look, the doctors say
its probably acid reflux.

220
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:21,133
Yeah, look, call me tomorrow.

221
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:24,621
There's a good chance
he'll be released. Okay. Bye-bye.

222
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:26,838
[Hangs up]
So is this fixing him?

223
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:29,639
If his acid reflux isn't
worse than we thought, yeah.

224
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:32,771
I've gotta be
in Spain in (<) four days.

225
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:34,200
Shouldn't be a problem.

226
00:11:34,284 --> 00:11:35,201
Great.

227
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:39,282
If I can just find the little bugger,
I should be able to suck it out.

228
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:46,203
Hmm. My legs feel weak.

229
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:48,652
You're under mild
sedation for the test.

230
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:50,620
It'll wear off.

231
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,824
[Monitor blips]
There it is.

232
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:01,161
Ah. Got it.

233
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:02,969
Oh, fantastic.
I'll pack his things.

234
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:06,278
Not yet. I want to monitor him
for a couple of hours.
Make sure he's okay.

235
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:08,435
Give him time to
sign a picture for me.

236
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,756
Maybe even a jersey.

237
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,377
"To Dr. Chase,
I owe you everything."

238
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,340
It doesn't have to
be that personal.

239
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:17,755
Oh. Not too many eBay shoppers
named Dr. Chase, huh? [Laughs]

240
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,791
Still trying to unload
the Barbara Walters spit cup.

241
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,441
Here you go.

242
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:29,278
Seriously, anything's fine.

243
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:32,841
Jeff?

244
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,575
Chase:
You all right?

245
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,336
Chase:
Jeff, can you swallow?

246
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,277
Hosue:
What makes a guy
start drooling?

247
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,623
Chase, were you
wearing your short shorts?

248
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:47,906
Muscle fatigue
in his neck and jaw.

249
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:50,155
He's obviously got something
worse than an air embolus.

250
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,022
Why?

251
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:53,214
Because you don't
drool from your lungs.

252
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:55,544
Maybe the problem's
not the embolus itself.

253
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:56,887
Maybe it's the treatment.

254
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,617
Maybe you hit a nerve.
Literally.

255
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,144
The embolectomy was clean.

256
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:03,764
His legs were tired too.

257
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:06,332
I thought it was from
the sedation, but if not,

258
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:07,690
it means he's got
something systemic.

259
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,158
Which means
it would have nothing to do with
the stunts he's been pulling.

260
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:14,946
Lupus or polymyositis.

261
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,654
It explains the
progressive muscle weakness.

262
00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:18,986
- It could be ALS.
- He's too young for that.

263
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,914
- Some type of muscular dystrophy?
- He's too old for that.

264
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:24,361
So what would be
just right, Goldilocks?

265
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:27,702
House:
Full blood workup,
including ANA for lupus.

266
00:13:27,786 --> 00:13:29,470
And get a muscle biopsy.

267
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:32,717
Find out if we're talking
myopathy or neuropathy.

268
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:34,684
I'm late for my session.

269
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,356
Session?

270
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,482
It's all a part of the process.

271
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:43,377
- You get angry and then you get...
- Yeah, I'm right on schedule.

272
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,415
So when am I gonna be done?

273
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:47,970
No, I need to know because
I've got plans to make. I mean...

274
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,533
when can I safely
book a game of squash?

275
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:52,651
Mark:
When am I gonna
stop being angry?

276
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:54,469
Not today.

277
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:58,217
I've come for the healing.

278
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:02,135
Dr. Harper,
as you know, I, uh...Ahem.

279
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:04,047
I have a bum leg.

280
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:07,655
What you don't know is
I'm upset about it.

281
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:09,036
I need to talk.

282
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:11,848
You know House.
You know we have a history.

283
00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:14,456
You've been telling me
for years that I should come by.

284
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:17,033
Here I am. Hi, guys.

285
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:18,487
Dr. Harper:
Got a Thursday group.

286
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:19,601
Poker night.

287
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:20,574
Monday morning?

288
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,803
Book club.

289
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:25,990
Well, look, if it's a problem,
I'll just go deal
with my rage privately.

290
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,031
Wait.

291
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:32,212
If you two could resolve
this tension, you could
really help each other.

292
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:36,106
I'm tired of fighting.

293
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,697
[Scoffs]

294
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,674
So either I say yes
or I'm the jerk?

295
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:44,154
Oh, God, I know that feeling.

296
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:48,518
I took the muscle specimen
from Jeff's thigh.

297
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:51,084
I figured that's where
we'd have the best chance
at finding something.

298
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,749
And the most painful
place to cut into.

299
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,110
I assume that's caffeine-free.

300
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:59,618
Wouldn't want to be artificially
boosting your performance.

301
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:01,062
Don't start her up again.

302
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:02,663
Caffeine's legal.

303
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,934
All about the rules, eh?

304
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,708
It's a bike race.

305
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:12,219
A completely arbitrary set of rules that
everyone complies with for no other reason
than that some committee says that they should.

306
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:13,565
- Huh.
- But that's the point.

307
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,681
That's what the game is.

308
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,880
So if you break an arbitrary rule,
Cameron damns you to hell,

309
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:19,836
but if you break a rule
that actually has a reason,

310
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,331
that's designed to protect people,
Cameron develops a crazy crush on you.

311
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:25,693
House doesn't pretend to
be some golden boy.

312
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:27,925
He does it to help people,
not to glorify himself.

313
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:30,306
So why don't you report Jeff
to the biking authorities?

314
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:31,930
Um, ethics.

315
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,288
Well, you wouldn't be
doing it to glorify yourself.

316
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:36,450
You'd just be trying to
make a better world.

317
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,003
Mark:
At least you can still
get around on your own.

318
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:42,433
Yeah, I know.

319
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,696
But you're starting to walk.

320
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,475
You're gonna get better.

321
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:49,412
Mark:
You have a job,
a way to be productive.

322
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,994
You have a wife.

323
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:53,122
Which gives greater meaning?

324
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:57,221
[Taps his cane 3 times]
A wife could make
things harder, too, I suppose.

325
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,888
This isn't about Stacy.

326
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,170
When it happened to me,
Stacy was great.

327
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:07,795
She kept telling me
not to rush it.

328
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:10,789
But I never believed her.

329
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:12,761
She means it.

330
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,353
I know, but...

331
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:20,039
Stacy...She didn't
have to wait, right?

332
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:22,310
And you know
she feels it too.

333
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:27,311
Means more time at work,
means more satisfaction from work.

334
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:29,926
She didn't get married
to be a nursemaid.

335
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,840
She wants a man.

336
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:40,276
Oh! [Scoffs]

337
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:44,499
How the hell could she have loved
a manipulative son of a bitch like you?

338
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,939
That's an interesting question.

339
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,014
Maybe she was attracted
to different things in the two of us.

340
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:50,169
She left YOU.

341
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:51,499
Then why was she
with me to begin with?

342
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,794
She made a mistake.

343
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:54,624
Maybe it's that simple.

344
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,564
Or maybe she saw something in me,
something she doesn't get from you.

345
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:00,788
- I'm not an ass.
- Maybe she wanted an ass.
She obviously did once.

346
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:02,365
Either he goes or I go.

347
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:03,671
You think
that's the kind of thing
you can just turn off?

348
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:04,795
Get him out of here!

349
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:07,576
Dr. House,
cancel your book group.

350
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,330
You're coming on Mondays.

351
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,163
Here's my new theory.

352
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:17,795
The drooling's
another competitive edge.

353
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:19,314
Nobody can drive behind him.

354
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:21,762
Road gets slick. He's the
only one not racing in the rain.

355
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:23,842
He can barely
move his arms or legs.

356
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,404
[Sighs] Paralysis?

357
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:26,830
No, just general weakness.

358
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:29,145
Muscle biopsy is
negative for polymyositis.

359
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:31,646
And ALS.
And muscular dystrophy.

360
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,749
Foreman:
ANA for lupus also negative.

361
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,674
Cameron:
Maybe his bike shorts
were just on too tight.

362
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:38,352
So by your rationale,
House shouldn't use a cane.

363
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:41,147
He should just drag his bum leg
around as God intended?

364
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:44,281
House has a handicap.
All he's aiming for is normality.

365
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:46,000
Chase:
And who decides what's normal?

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,501
What if we find a drug that
makes people live 20 years longer?

367
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,829
Should we ban that
because it's not normal?

368
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:52,483
Jeff doesn't want normal.
He wants super powers.

369
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:54,007
So why is he normal?

370
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:55,924
Oh, God. You too?

371
00:17:56,136 --> 00:17:58,328
He's shooting
for extraordinary.

372
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,358
So why is everything so ordinary?

373
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:03,606
I mean, this guy's breathing,
drinking, and injecting himself

374
00:18:03,606 --> 00:18:07,616
with everything he can find
to amp up his body chemistry,
and yet every test is normal.

375
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,173
He's artificially
raising his red blood count,
so why isn't it raised?

376
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:15,472
Maybe his count is raised.
Maybe what's normal for us
is out of whack for him.

377
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:17,054
Can't slip anything by you.

378
00:18:17,198 --> 00:18:19,356
Well, if that's true,
his white cells are up too,

379
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,161
which would point to
some kind of infection.

380
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:22,992
Muscle weakness, exhaustion.

381
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:24,561
He could have encephalitis.

382
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:25,896
That's kind of a long shot.

383
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,313
Yeah. But it's been over an hour
since we poked the patient
with something sharp, so...

384
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:34,349
get a lumbar puncture and
order broad-spectrum antibiotics.

385
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,827
[On phone]
No, it's not about judging.

386
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:40,615
It's just that on a dating service
you should post a photo.

387
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,294
I have to go.

388
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:48,443
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- No, not a problem. I was just, uh...

389
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:51,210
- ...accounting.
- I'm Jeff Forster's manager.

390
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,972
He's been here a whole day
and it doesn't seem like
we're any closer to a diagnosis.

391
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:57,868
Jeff Forster.
A whole day, huh?

392
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:02,923
Mm-hmm. I was just wondering
if I could help speed things up.

393
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,893
Your client's had
a muscle biopsy,
a full blood workup,

394
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,449
and he's scheduled
for a lumbar puncture
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

395
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:10,193
Jeff is in the Lucas Wing.

396
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:12,910
If Mr. Lucas showed up
needing a lumbar puncture,

397
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:14,589
would he have to wait
until tomorrow?

398
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:15,961
Mr. Lucas is dead.

399
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,469
Good. Then there's an opening.

400
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:23,462
Jeff is used to doing whatever
he has to to be first, isn't he?

401
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,292
It's been very
lucrative for him.

402
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:28,415
He feels it's important that
he give something back.

403
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,596
I hear you've been
raising funds for your
nuclear medicine department.

404
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,738
Or whatever.

405
00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:47,891
Thank you, guys,
for working so late.
[Wheezes]

406
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,512
Glad to be here.

407
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:53,556
The lumbar puncture will tell us
what kind of infection you've got.

408
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,827
In the meantime,
we're administering antibiotics.

409
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:00,762
Do you like being a hero?

410
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:04,049
[Harsh breath (>)]
It's a living.

411
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:05,864
You don't feel a
sense of responsibility?

412
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,844
There's kids out there
that worship you.

413
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:13,851
When I was a rookie (>)
on the tour, (>)

414
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,700
I got a letter from a guy
in Wisconsin (>)

415
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:20,253
who wanted me to
send a note to his son. (>)

416
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:22,793
Said he worshipped me. (>)

417
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:26,396
You know
what "worship" means?
(>) I looked it up.

418
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:32,835
It means to love...
unquestioningly and uncritically. (>)

419
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:36,239
So the kid doesn't
even know me, (>)

420
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:40,197
but he loves me (>)
unquestioningly (>)
and uncritically.

421
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:43,175
So you decided to
take advantage of that.

422
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:45,076
What should I have done? (>)

423
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,793
"Dear sir, (>) "I'm just a guy (>)
who rides a bike (>) pretty good. (>)

424
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:55,683
You and your kid are (>)
out of your minds"? (>)

425
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,435
(>) My arms feel funny.

426
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:02,273
[labored breathing and choking]
[Monitor starts beeping]

427
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:04,893
Foreman:
His SATs are dropping.
He's in respiratory arrest.

428
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:06,469
He can't be.
We fixed that.

429
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:08,533
Apparently not.

430
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:27,101
House:
So glad we cured
his respiratory arrest.

431
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,357
Freed him up to
develop respiratory arrest.

432
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:31,581
Foreman:
LP was negative
for encephalitis.

433
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,273
The white count's still the same,
but the red count's fallen to 29%.

434
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,723
What was my theory
yesterday?

435
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:38,948
That I screwed up
the embolectomy.

436
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,601
We'll get a chest x-ray to check.

437
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:42,942
I didn't screw up.
Why would you...

438
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:45,394
How can you be so petty,
Chase? He's down a quart.

439
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:48,054
Either he's losing blood
because you nicked something,

440
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,384
or he's just not producing blood,
in which place we're talking...

441
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:52,867
acute anemia combined
with a muscular disorder.

442
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,460
Paraneoplastic syndrome?

443
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:57,540
Either you screwed up
or he's got cancer.

444
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:06,449
I think I should
start smoking again.

445
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,452
You want a medical opinion
supporting that decision?

446
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,464
The symptoms started
as soon as I quit.

447
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:13,858
Symptoms meaning...

448
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:15,451
diarrhea.

449
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:17,176
A lot of diarrhea.

450
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,709
Ten or twelve times a day.
It's really embarrassing.

451
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,550
I'm a flight attendant and...

452
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,235
[Smack!]

453
00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:26,166
On the upside,
my hiccups are gone.

454
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,402
You went to his group.

455
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:30,757
You were the one who was all,
"Greg, you need to
confront your feelings."

456
00:22:30,758 --> 00:22:32,689
[Smacks again]
That was five years ago.

457
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:33,730
Well, I've been pissy.

458
00:22:33,814 --> 00:22:36,258
Fine. You don't want help.
Does that mean
nobody should get it?

459
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:39,166
Mark's looking for help
because, what?, he's resentful?

460
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,543
Overwhelmed?
I'm asking because I care.

461
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:42,582
Not about him.

462
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,760
You still want to jump me,
so you don't care whose marriage...

463
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:47,221
Listen, I can get my rocks off
any time I want.

464
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:51,220
What I don't seem to be able to do
is my job without you
hanging over my shoulder.

465
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:53,633
[Resigned sigh]

466
00:22:56,615 --> 00:22:58,338
How many packs?

467
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:02,377
A bit over one a day, but
they were lights and I quit.

468
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:04,868
You used to go out with her?

469
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:07,833
Yeah. What was I thinking?

470
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:12,052
I'm talking about the gum
you're chewing to replace
smoking as an oral fixation.

471
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:13,322
How many packs?

472
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,419
Six, maybe seven.

473
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,948
Stacy:
I'm trying to protect you.

474
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:19,993
Cuddy and I may be the only people
stopping you from jumping off a cliff...

475
00:23:19,993 --> 00:23:22,256
- You're pissy.
- No, I am angry.

476
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,331
Pissy. You get pissy
when you're frustrated.

477
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:25,045
Shut up.

478
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:26,824
Okay, I'm wrong.

479
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:30,037
This is unbelievably
difficult for Mark,
which you should know.

480
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:33,501
Which you should
be able to summon up
some level of empathy for.

481
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,131
Right. The crippled boys.

482
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,790
We should start a band.

483
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,633
I have a good thing with Mark.

484
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,216
We are handling this
the best way we know how.

485
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,910
And none of this has
anything to do with me?

486
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:47,538
No, nothing. Except that
you can't or won't just let it go.

487
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:51,233
Let it go.

488
00:23:57,578 --> 00:23:58,666
[Smack!]

489
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:00,876
You're being poisoned.

490
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,588
By gum?

491
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:06,109
Sugarless gum uses
sorbitol as a sweetener.

492
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:09,422
We use sorbitol
as a laxative.

493
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:18,134
Moira:
This'll tell you if he's got
cancer in his blood?

494
00:24:18,372 --> 00:24:21,268
If he does, we'll see
abnormal cells in the marrow.

495
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,986
How long will the test take?

496
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,217
I'll get them in
as soon as I can.

497
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,412
And if doesn't have cancer,
what else could it be?

498
00:24:30,496 --> 00:24:33,618
It's possible
some damage was done during
one of the tests we gave him.

499
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:38,281
So either one of your doctors
screwed up a simple procedure,
or he's got cancer.

500
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:41,666
We can't know anything for sure
until the biopsy comes back.

501
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:45,635
It stings, I know.

502
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,210
No, he wants the tube out.

503
00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:48,485
Can't do that, Jeff.

504
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,812
Wilson:
If you want to say something,
you've got to write it down.

505
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:52,069
Okay?

506
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:53,591
Here.

507
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:06,269
[ Did I do this to myself ? ]

508
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,701
If it's cancer, it's possible.

509
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:15,159
There's no way to know for sure.

510
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:22,039
Phone not working?

511
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,746
One of the morgue attendants
asked me to bring this to you.

512
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:32,235
I wonder why
they're calling me.

513
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:38,231
Yeah, me too actually.
I was wondering why the Times
was returning your call.

514
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:41,797
You a doctor or
the bicycle police?

515
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:43,109
He's cheating.

516
00:25:43,986 --> 00:25:45,698
He shouldn't get away with it.

517
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:49,711
[Sighs]
Have you actually
told them anything yet?

518
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:50,949
You worried
about the precedent?

519
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,413
I'm worried about you.

520
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,975
You gonna turn me in?

521
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:56,269
No.

522
00:25:58,698 --> 00:26:00,119
He's made a mistake.

523
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,510
Revealing the truth
doesn't undo it.

524
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,375
Kids love him and
he's not who they think he is.

525
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:06,414
It's not right.

526
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:09,720
Who cares if he's
what he says he is?
Who the hell is?

527
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:13,030
If love's based on lies,
does that mean
it's not a real feeling?

528
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:15,306
Doesn't bring
the same pleasure?

529
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,733
Are we still talking
about the patient?

530
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:25,946
Have you ever cheated?

531
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,764
Well, I have.
You want to punish him,
good for you.

532
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,454
But you can't do it
without punishing the
people who love him.

533
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,229
Is that you justified
lying to you wives?

534
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:43,569
I always told them.

535
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:49,173
Foreman:
Well, he's negative for bleeds.

536
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:52,728
Congratulations, Chase.
It's cancer.

537
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,731
Clean him up and
let oncology have him.

538
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,181
Hosue:
It's their party now.

539
00:26:57,238 --> 00:26:58,491
He doesn't have cancer.

540
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,352
Biopsy shows he's got
pure red cell aplasia.

541
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:04,141
There's no way PRCA could
manifest so suddenly.

542
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:07,481
Unless it's drug-induced.
He's lying about not being on EPO.

543
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,301
Why would he lie?

544
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:10,846
What does it matter?

545
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:15,599
People lie
for thousands of reasons,
but there's always a reason.

546
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:18,021
Philosophically interesting,
medically irrelevant.

547
00:27:18,105 --> 00:27:19,950
Unless he's not lying.

548
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:25,492
[Sighs]
You've got a leak.

549
00:27:25,654 --> 00:27:27,798
The press is all over
the Jeff Forster story.

550
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:30,936
On the off-chance that
one of you was stupid enough to
call from your own office,

551
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:33,850
I'm pulling your phone records.
Including your cell phones.

552
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:38,833
I assume if I point out the fact
that you have no right to do that
you'll interpret that as a sign of guilt.

553
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:40,083
Wilson's chatty.

554
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:43,753
House:
Plus he's got two ex-wives to support.
You want me to tell him he's fired?

555
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:46,803
Until we figure out
who's behind this,
I'm sitting in with you guys.

556
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:49,875
You have the ethics
of a four-year-old.
I'm gonna treat you like one.

557
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,054
How am I supposed to
practice medicine with a lawyer
sitting on my shoulder?

558
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,066
Responsibly.

559
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:56,058
You know I can't do that.

560
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:58,143
Cameron.

561
00:27:58,633 --> 00:27:59,473
I'm not the leak.

562
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:02,129
Somebody once told me
that everybody lies.

563
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,178
And since you're the only people
who know he has cancer...

564
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:05,388
He doesn't have cancer.

565
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:07,469
Cuddy: The point is
you're his medical team.

566
00:28:07,574 --> 00:28:09,228
He's threatening to sue.

567
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,165
Why would Cameron leak cancer?

568
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:15,482
How does cancer
make the guy look bad?

569
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:22,157
He's on EPO.

570
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:28,523
Your anemia is caused by
pure red blood cell aplasia.

571
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:31,701
This is gonna hurt,
but we've gotta talk.

572
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:33,146
What the hell are you doing?

573
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,695
He'll be fine. Sort of.
[Caughs]

574
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:38,517
I just don't have time to
watch him write out answers.

575
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:41,781
PRCA comes in two varieties.

576
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,311
Chronic and acute.

577
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:46,480
Since it came on fast,
you have the acute version.

578
00:28:46,564 --> 00:28:47,813
He doesn't have cancer.

579
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:50,524
Is the good news.
The bad new is...

580
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:52,792
Pants are on fire.

581
00:28:52,994 --> 00:28:55,402
Acute PRCA is caused by drugs.

582
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:57,252
Most commonly, EPO.

583
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,617
Ready, and...action!

584
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,899
But I haven't used EPO.

585
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:03,878
[Sighs] Okay.

586
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,933
But this time with more anger.

587
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:08,537
Remember, this guy's
accusing you of cheating.

588
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:10,954
I haven't used that stuff. (<)

589
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:14,274
Oh! Mwah!
I believed it.

590
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:16,472
It was simple. It was pure.
Did you believe it?

591
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,381
I guess
it's silly to cast someone
after the first audition.

592
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:20,546
Why don't you do a reading?

593
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:22,949
Give me that.
He doesn't do EPO.

594
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,730
Hmm. What did you think?

595
00:29:24,814 --> 00:29:27,677
I mean, it's a different way to go,
but I don't know, I just didn't buy it.

596
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:29,363
Does she handle
any of your injections?

597
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:31,300
You think I'm giving it to him?

598
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:32,613
Test him.

599
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,969
Gee. That's a great idea.

600
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,251
I sure hope that
EPO's not one of those drugs
that's undetectable after six hours.

601
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:41,400
Hey, you know
what we can test for?

602
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:42,791
Phone calls.

603
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:45,642
Take her cell phone,
push the redial button.

604
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:49,340
Even money says you'll be
connected to the newspaper
that leaked your cancer story.

605
00:29:50,473 --> 00:29:51,548
Okay.

606
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,625
Okay, I should've told you.

607
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,818
It's not just
about the races, Jeff.

608
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,890
It's about your image. Okay?

609
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:04,789
If you come back from cancer,
those sponsors will be all over you.

610
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:09,960
Okay, so I messed up.
Okay? But I did not give you EPO.

611
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:12,224
That stuff could kill me.

612
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:13,847
Meh meh meh meh.

613
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:15,845
House:
Come on, give her a break.

614
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,225
She's only doing what she
has to do to advance her career.

615
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:20,367
Don't you have that
tattooed on your tushie?

616
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:23,845
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

617
00:30:24,332 --> 00:30:25,857
House:
Who are you gonna believe?

618
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:28,512
The manager
you've trusted for years?

619
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,730
Pff! I've been to college.

620
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,808
You're fired.

621
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,229
Okay.

622
00:30:52,562 --> 00:30:55,683
You're basing this whole
diagnosis, everything,

623
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,478
on the idea that I was
slipping him illegal drugs.

624
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:02,415
Huh.

625
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:07,031
You're gonna kill him.

626
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:22,348
If Dr. House is so sure,
why do you need to stay?

627
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,662
He's a very cautious man.

628
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:26,427
You're breathing's better.

629
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,635
Let the prednisone do its job.
Get some sleep.

630

[Wheezing]

00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:39,848
Jeff?

[Monitor starts beeping]

633
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:53,027
His red blood cell count
plummeted to 16%.

634
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,258
He passed out,
had to be resuscitated,
and he still can't move his legs.

635
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:59,268
That's not possible.
The drugs should be
flushing out of his system.

636
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:01,180
Can't leave
if they don't exist.

637
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:04,217
The EPO use explains
every one of his symptoms.

638
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,994
He's been lying and cheating,
and now it's coming back to bite him.

639
00:32:07,078 --> 00:32:11,723
The only problem with that theory is
it's based on the assumption that
the universe is a just place.

640
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:14,863
If it were, then
his poor manager wouldn't
have been fired for no reason.

641
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,260
- Lambert-Eaton.
- His chest was clear.

642
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,768
Chase: So we run
an electromyography test.

643
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,881
Cameron:
You're still not
explaining the PRCA.

644
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:25,451
What's his red count now?

645
00:32:25,535 --> 00:32:28,116
I had to give him
a blood transfusion.
He's back around 30.

646
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:30,554
He needed a transfusion?

647
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:33,991
Well, he was losing blood, so
I thought maybe he needed blood.

648

[Stirring his coffee]

His neck?

651
00:32:41,384 --> 00:32:44,572
Or repeat everything
I say in question form.

652
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:59,401
She came into the clinic
and yelled at me.

653
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,396
Then she left,
then she came back
and yelled some more.

654
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,122
Hmm. Yelling.

655
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,812
That might be a clue.

656
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:09,772
Well, I know
what the yelling means.

657
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:12,260
It's the coming and going
I find interesting.

658

- It's not rational.
- Anger's not rational.

659
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,188
Some anger is.

660
00:33:16,272 --> 00:33:19,259
She could've pulled me aside,
screamed at my privately.

661
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:22,770
Her beef is simple
and well-founded.

662
00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:24,751
But she was out of control.

663
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,251
You're having fun, aren't you?

664
00:33:26,377 --> 00:33:28,594
She's in my face.
I need to know why.

665
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:31,671
- Professional reasons.
- Oh. Why else?

666
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:35,404
Do you really think
this is going to end well?

667
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,073

Don't have a clue. We on?

672
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:53,834
No way.

673
00:33:57,754 --> 00:34:00,274
No. We'll find something.

674
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:06,014
Chase:
We found a thymoma.

675
00:34:06,098 --> 00:34:07,517
Foreman:
How'd you know
to look in his neck?

676
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:09,510
Thymomas usually
present in the chest.

677
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:11,407
I knew it wasn't
in his chest.

678
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:14,176
All we've done
since he checked in is
look at his chest.

679
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,851
- Well, all the more reason not to think...
- There are two types of PRCA.

680
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:19,924
Acute comes on suddenly.
Chronic takes its time.

681
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,014
We all thought
Jeff's was acute because
it happened right in front of us,

682
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:25,517
but what if it had been there
for months? Maybe years?

683
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:27,431
There's no way.
It would've kept him
from racing.

684
00:34:27,497 --> 00:34:30,137
With that kind of anemia,
he would've needed constant...

685
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:32,906
Blood transfusions.

686
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,785
Which he was getting in
convenient blood doping form.

687
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:35,534
[Elevator dings]

688
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:37,868
He was treating himself
without even knowing it.

689
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,442
Up to half of patients with
chronic PRCA have a thymoma,

690
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:44,329
and up to half the patients
with a thymoma...

691
00:34:45,153 --> 00:34:47,272
I've always wanted to do this.

692
00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:59,195
I'm not getting any better. (>)

693
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:00,753
Does that mean I'm...(>)

694
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,549
Ow.

695
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:04,442
You are healed.

696
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:05,914
Rise and walk.

697
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:07,367
Are you insane?

698
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:12,057
In the Bible, they just say,
"Yes, Lord," and then
start right in on the praising.

699
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:15,975
First you tell me
I've got cancer, (>)

700
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:20,392
and then you tell me
that my manager...

701
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:29,625
Huh!

702
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:32,152
Huh, huh!

703
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:34,723
What did you do?

704
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,241
No. What do you do, Lord?

705
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:40,129
Thymoma is a tumor
on the thymus gland.

706
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:42,814
He's a bit a wimp, but
he hangs with the tough guys.

707
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:46,772
PRCA and an auto-immune disease
called myasthenia gravis.

708
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:52,310
MG causes muscle fatigue,
including respiratory problems
and difficulty swallowing.

709
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:54,789
Oh. And it can
hit you that fast?

710
00:35:54,873 --> 00:35:57,252
The treatment for PRCA
is blood transfusions.

711
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,544
The treatment
for MG is hyperbaria.

712
00:35:59,628 --> 00:36:02,386
You were doing both as part
of your regular freak show.

713
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,570
When you took a break,
everything went to hell.

714
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:07,286
Which is not an
uncommon reaction to Jersey.

715
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:08,606
So...

716
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:11,792
The whole thing
with my manager.

717
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:14,226
Oops. No.

718
00:36:14,388 --> 00:36:15,589
No EPO.

719
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:18,009
This has nothing to do
with anything you did.

720
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,658
You can let her know
she's in the clear.

721
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:22,790
I could. Or...

722
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,234
Ten perfect of a Nike contract
is a hell of a lot of cash.

723
00:36:28,331 --> 00:36:29,295
God.

724
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:30,820
You don't need your thymus.

725
00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:32,477
We take it out.
Everything else is manageable.

726
00:36:32,561 --> 00:36:34,285
Manageable? I thought
you just cured me.

727
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:37,005
Un-uh. This is
just diagnostic.

728
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:40,532
Tensilon erases the symptoms
of MG for five or six minutes.

729
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:44,184
[Starts gasping again]

730
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:51,593
Sometimes less.

731
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,618
This is exactly why
I created nurses.

732
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:57,843
Clean up on aisle three!

733
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:12,513
If you've come to search my office,
you should wait ten minutes.
I'll be out of your hair.

734
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:16,177
Here. Start with my purse.
Just save me some mints.

735
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:19,198
What do you want to know?
My sex life with Mark?

736
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:21,574
My guilt over
crippling your damn leg?

737
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:24,031
Or are you just here to gloat
because you weren't the leak?

738
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:26,598
I want to apologize.

739
00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:33,138
Maybe I've...

740
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:37,331
been punishing you
for a little too long.

741
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:41,910
And maybe
you've been punishing me.

742
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:46,342
If we're gonna work together,
I need to know.

743
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:52,534
Do you hate me
or do you love me?

744
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,608
Either way, I think
we've got a problem.

745
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:00,811
I hate you.

746
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,012
And I love you.

747
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:07,815
And I love Mark.

748
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:11,744
And you don't hate him.

749
00:38:11,828 --> 00:38:13,134
No.

750
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:17,597
So what do we do?

751
00:38:17,894 --> 00:38:20,154
We deal with each other.

752
00:38:20,238 --> 00:38:23,654
Hmph. Right.

753
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:27,177
That plans been
working great so far.

754
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:31,006
It'll get better.
It'll get easier.

755
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:31,965
Why?

756
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:34,902
I don't know. That's
what my therapist tells me.

757
00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:00,634
<i>[On TV] In the professional cycling world,
we are subject to what seems like
constant witch hunts and finger pointing.</i>

758
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:06,536
<i>But I want to thank Dr. House
and the excellent medical team
here at Princeton Plainsboro.</i>

759
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:11,487
<i>My hope is that
this diagnosis will put to rest
any rumors that I would ever use...</i>

760
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:15,693
He needs blood transfusions
every two weeks, which means
he can dope all he wants.

761
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:18,048
He's a got a doctor's pass.

762
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:20,372
It's medicinal.

763
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,034
He got away with it.

764
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,708
Mm-hmm.

765
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:27,612
He cheated and won a game.

766
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:32,824
Life's more complicated than
who gets to the finish line first.

767
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:40,383
I fell in love with
my husband's best friend.

768
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,991
Near the end, I was
at the hospital every day,

769
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,163
and Joe would
come by after work.

770
00:39:51,752 --> 00:39:55,163
We'd go for walks and try to
talk each other through it.

771
00:39:56,262 --> 00:39:58,653
We kind of clung
on to each other.

772
00:40:03,222 --> 00:40:05,268
My wife...

773
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,262
wasn't dying.
She wasn't even sick.

774
00:40:09,593 --> 00:40:11,561
Everything was fine.

775
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:16,189
I met someone who...Ahem.

776
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,260
Made me feel...funny.

777
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:24,252
Good.

778
00:40:25,057 --> 00:40:28,186
And I didn't want to
let that feeling go.

779
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,903
What happened to you...

780
00:40:37,878 --> 00:40:41,023
How can anyone
go through that alone?

781
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:43,084
You can't control your emotions.

782
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:44,506
No.

783
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,480
Just your actions.

784
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:59,575
You didn't do it, did you?
You didn't sleep with him.

785
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:03,257
I couldn't have
lived with myself.

786
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:13,962
You'd be surprised
what you can live with.

787
00:41:29,444 --> 00:41:30,537
Hey.

788
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:34,750
I need you to open a door.

789
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:36,106
Not allowed.

790
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:41,161
Yeah, I was having therapy
in here today, and I left my cane.

791
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:42,311
Sorry.

792
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:46,072
Dude...

793
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:49,141
I'm crippled.
