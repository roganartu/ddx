That doesn't sound too good.

168
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,044
CAMERON:
His fingers are even darker.

169
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,987
His temperature's 102
and spiking.

170
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,254
And the x-ray
now shows lung infiltrates.

171
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:32,528
Well, the good news is he
won't be bitching about losing
his hand if he can't breathe.

172
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:36,034
The trauma from the fall
could have caused acute
respiratory distress syndrome.

173
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,967
Right. I forgot. Your roof.

174
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,766
It would cause
lung infiltrates
and maybe fever

175
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,831
and conceivably
the cyanotic fingers.

176
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,173
The only question is why.
Why what?

177
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,145
Why her weird psychopathology

178
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,706
requires a diagnosis
informed entirely
by personal guilt.

179
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,683
Let's assume
we've been wrong up until now.

180
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,551
Let's assume,
just for one second,

181
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,489
that the earth doesn't revolve
around Cuddy's roof.

182
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,557
What if he was sick
before he had his run-in
with gravity?

183
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,926
He just didn't
notice anything.

184
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,932
Well, pneumonia
can cause DlC which can cause
cyanotic fingers.

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,059
Pneumonia doesn't hit
that fast.
Sure.

186
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,503
Only pavement hits that fast.
It's not pneumonia.

187
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,069
He might have missed
a finger turning dark.

188
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,541
He's not gonna miss
breathing problems.

189
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,407
What else?
It's pneumonia.

190
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,638
He wanted to go home.
I thought he was lying.

191
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,844
I told him
I had a dinner party.
I made him go up there.

192
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,850
Well, why didn't you
just take out a gun
and shoot him?

193
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,549
I thought it was just asthma.

194
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,922
You might've mentioned this
earlier, Doctor.

195
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,484
Maybe we could have sent
some blood cultures to the lab

196
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,224
instead of wasting a day
indulging your self-loathing.

197
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:43,564
If it's just garden-variety
bacterial pneumonia,
he's gonna be fine.

198
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,163
So give him garden-variety
Levaquin, and a garden-variety
echocardiogram.

199
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,433
And go check out
the kid's house.

200
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,737
The blood work
will show us which type
of pneumonia it is...

201
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,439
If he's huffing nail polish
or pulling the wings
off his pet parrot,

202
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,980
this way'll be faster.

203
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,211
And I bet
Julio's just dying to find out
what's wrong with him.

204
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,515
Go with her.
It's Alfredo.

205
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,286
And I can handle
getting a key and...

206
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,292
Rico and I no longer trust you
deciding what's important
and what's not.

Trust me,

209

to break into her house.

What? Wait, wait, wait...

211

See? It is shocking.

212
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,773
The guy's
been working there every day
for the last three weeks.

213
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,877
You think
it's impossible he could've
picked something up?

214
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,151
I'm not breaking
into my boss's house.
I'm your boss.

215
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,021

216
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,825

House is having lunch
with his juniors now?

218
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,235
No. Not a chance.
Then where do you think
they're going?

219
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,241
I have no idea.

220
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,201
Then why don't you think
they're going to lunch?

221
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,303
Because it's not like House.
That was your point, right?

222
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,642
He had that smug look
on his face.

223
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,114
When he's that pleased
about something

224
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,583
he's gotta tell somebody,
and the only somebody
he knows is you.

What?

Why?

229
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,286
Why is he so curious
about Cuddy?

230

Why are you so curious
about his curiosity?

231

Why are you so curious
about me...

232
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,826
Because you dumped him
and you're married

233

and they are neither
of those things.

234
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,870
I'm just curious.

Nothing wrong with that.
No. Nothing wrong with that.

Count me in.

No furniture polish,
no paint thinner, nor
anything else worth sniffing.

241
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,677
Nothing in here, either,
except a few cockroaches.

242
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,486
Nice. Someone
should fix Alfredo's roof.

243
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:23,094
So, why haven't you
fired House?

244
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,363
It's just, you guys are always
screaming at each other,

I don't hate him.

Why not?

247
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,543
He's a great doctor,

248
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,546
but any other
hospital administrator would
have fired him years ago.

249
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,979
CUDDY: Four of them did.

250
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,610
The question is,
why did I hire him?

about her key?

You been doing
a little handyman work
for Cuddy yourself?

253
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,992
Someone as obsessive
and insecure as Cuddy
probably has three extra keys

254
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,619
hidden away
within 10 feet of the door.

255
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,893
And you consider obsession
a negative quality.

256

Soap is hypoallergenic.

You both went to Michigan.
Did you know him
while you were there?

I was still an undergrad,
but, yeah, I knew him.

261
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,388
He was already a legend.

262
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:34,193
So you just knew him
as a legend?

What does that mean?

too nasty to each other
not to have been nasty.

to take his impending death
in stride.

Rats.

Rat bites.

But he says
they're from construction work

287
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,033

he's got rats at home.

to invade my privacy.

far more likely.

and aggressive route
didn't work the last time.

00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,426
A lot of guilt.
A lot of screaming.

664
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,102
I know this wasn't just
because it was your roof.

665
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,535
Cuddy,

666
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,979
you see the world as it is,
and you see the world
as it could be.

667
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,115
And what you don't see
is what everybody else sees,

668
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,623
the giant gaping chasm
in between.

669
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,158
House, I'm not naive.

670
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:32,389
I realize...
If you did, you never
would have hired me.

671
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,592
You're not happy
unless things are just right,

672
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,297
which means two things.

673
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,836
That you're a good boss,
and you'll never be happy.

674
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,545
By the way,
why does everybody think
you and I had sex?

675
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,616
You think there could be
something to it?

676
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,492
WlLSON: Cuddy feels guilty
about not diagnosing
psittacosis any earlier?

677
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,432
I think so.

678
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,674
There's no way
she could have.

679
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,502
No.

680
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,105
No way she could have.

681
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,641
(SLOW ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG)

682
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,554
It's raining.
