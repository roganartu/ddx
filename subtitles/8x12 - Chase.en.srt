the closest I had to family.

181
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:21,098
Turned out that wasn't much of
a reason to join the priesthood.

182
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,700
Is that why you left?

183
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,170
Something like that.

184
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:35,614
I think I may throw up.

185
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,893
What's wrong with me?

186
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:52,163
Not a fungal infection.

187
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,605
You're probably wondering,
why the soda balloons?

188
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:03,740
I'm not.

189
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,975
Well, I'll tell you.

190
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,410
You're not the only one

191
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:08,845
whose life spiraled
out of control

192
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:10,580
when you got knifed
in the ventricle.

193
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:11,715
Taub has decided--

194
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:13,016
I need help
with my patient.

195
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:14,351
She's vomiting.

196
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,119
That's not from
a fungal infection.

197
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:17,220
What are you
planning to do

198
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:18,388
now that you're
not working for me?

199
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,457
I have no idea.

200
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:22,293
Almost dying's
been clarifying.

201
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,560
I can do anything.

202
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:25,663
You can do anything.

203
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,265
So you come back
to the same building

204
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,167
you've worked in
for years.

205
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,669
Guess you can cross that
off your bucket list.

206
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:33,438
Can we get to my patient
sometime soon?

207
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:36,875
As soon as you admit that
you're a confused mess, sure.

208
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:38,343
You'll help me.

209
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,411
'Cause even though you don't
find my case interesting,

210
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,513
you find my interest in it
interesting.

211
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:47,218
Well, when you
put it that way...

212
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:48,886
Ascending colangitis.

213
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:54,659
Missed me.

214
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:55,759
<i>Can't be,</i>
<i>bilirubin's normal.</i>

215
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:58,963
Clinical signs
can show up days

216
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,332
<i>before lab signs.</i>

217
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:04,067
Ha ha ha!

218
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:07,204
<i>This is great.</i>

219
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:08,706
<i>We should make this</i>
<i>a regular thing.</i>

220
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:14,045
She can't feel
her foot at all.

221
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:20,451
What does this mean?

222
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,253
It means I've got
to spend more time

223
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,722
consulting
with a colleague.

224
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:35,687
He tried to tongue-kiss Park
when you were closer.

225
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,356
You think his sexuality
is normal?

226
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:39,892
I need more help.
My patient has a new symptom.

227
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,294
<i>Ischemic foot.</i>

228
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,297
Get the lecture
out of your system

229
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:44,998
so we can talk
about my case.

230
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,872
Let me start
with an allegory.

231
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:53,239
Ah.

232
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,413
Okay, I'm curious.

233
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,616
Your overreaction
to your stabbing

234
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:05,986
is to blame me even as
you are drawn to me.

235
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:09,190
Taub's is to take
moronic self-defense classes

236
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:11,726
that won't defend him
against anything.

237
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:13,261
Krav maga.

238
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,762
Which helped me
block your shot

239
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,764
and will continue
to help me

240
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:17,032
defend myself in a building

241
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,500
full of drugged-up strangers.

242
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:21,503
Taub has to accept
that by instinct and genetics

243
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:23,105
he is a coward,

244
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:24,340
<i>who's better off</i>
<i>running and hiding</i>

245
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:25,908
<i>at the first sign</i>
<i>of danger.</i>

246
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,577
I've already fended off six
of your blitzkriegs in a row.

247
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,579
And the seventh?
And the eighth?

248
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,748
And the nth?

249
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:33,749
If you get him,
what's that gonna prove?

250
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:35,716
That unexpected things happen.

251
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:38,919
<i>By definition, no class can</i>
<i>teach you to expect them.</i>

252
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:41,956
<i>Which is why Taub</i>
<i>is idiotic to study them,</i>

253
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:44,057
<i>and you're idiotic to attach</i>
<i>any significance to them.</i>

254
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,559
Blood clot.

255
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:48,562
Her D-Dimer's normal.

256
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,064
On the other hand--

257
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,898
[grunting]

258
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:54,234
Yah!

259
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:58,038
What if he's right
about the blockage

260
00:12:58,106 --> 00:12:59,473
but wrong
about the cause?

261
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,408
<i>Vasospasm.</i>

262
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:04,144
That explains everything
but the lymph nodes.

263
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,846
And any minor infection
could have caused those.

264
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:08,548
Calcium channel blocker
to treat.

265
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,060
Are you okay?

266
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:22,762
I almost got you killed
by bringing a scalpel

267
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,097
into that room.

268
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:25,231
I could feel better
about that.

269
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:27,367
You saved my life too.

270
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:30,637
I think the ledger's clear.

271
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:33,139
But how can you not
be traumatized?

272
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:35,508
Can't change
what happened.

273
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:38,244
Can only make better
choices from here.

274
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:39,879
So you're Zen about it

275
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:41,948
but won't let go
of your anger toward House?

276
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,286
I'm seeing
a trauma counselor.

277
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:48,788
I think you should too.

278
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:51,091
I'm okay.

279
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:53,059
Just knowing you're there
for me is enough.

280
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,438
Convent lets you
have this?

281
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:06,808
I borrowed it from
one of the nurses.

282
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:08,777
I'm still on temporary vows.

283
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:11,747
<i>It may be the last time</i>
<i>I hear Eminem for a while.</i>

284
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:14,216
You're using an iPod.

285
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:16,351
But I've never seen you
use rosary beads.

286
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,791
What day did Jesus die?

287
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:26,061
I know,
one gospel says passover,

288
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:28,430
another says
the day before.

289
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:29,564
How many times
did the cock crow

290
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,633
before Peter's
third denial?

291
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:32,934
Once or twice?

292
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,570
You can't argue away
my faith.

293
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:36,805
Why?

294
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,206
Because it's so strong

295
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:39,674
even plain contradictions--

296
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:42,577
because it's not
that strong.

297
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,879
I'm not saying
I don't have faith.

298
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:49,150
I just haven't felt
the calling yet.

299
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:52,153
No one joins the clergy
without having that epiphany.

300
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,955
That God's love
is speaking to you directly.

301
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:58,892
It's the silence,
the contemplation,

302
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,160
the order.

303
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:02,595
I need them.

304
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:08,000
Hoping everything else
will come later.

305
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:10,336
That's not an answer.

306
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:12,705
If you want silence,
you can get ear plugs.

307
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:14,975
I tried the outside world.

308
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:17,010
It wasn't enough.

309
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:18,178
Have you been married?

310
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,547
No.

311
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,616
No kids.
You never found a career.

312
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:24,052
Doesn't sound like the outside
world got much of a try.

313
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:29,290
What you're
headed towards now,

314
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:32,026
14 hours a day
in silent prayer,

315
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:34,462
never having a family,

316
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,965
never touching
another human being.

317
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:39,000
Just because that's
what you'd miss the most.

318
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:43,270
The nurses talk.

319
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,642
Nothing's wrong
with having fun.

320
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,912
They said you were almost
killed three weeks ago.

321
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,281
You go right back to fun?

322
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:57,283
Is that why
you wanna be a nun?

323
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:58,851
Someone broke your heart.

324
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,388
No.

325
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:06,825
I'm just looking
for something more.

326
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:10,695
So am I.

327
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,442
I'm late for work
in the clinic.

328
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,362
Really?

329
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,031
George Washingbaum?

330
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:47,466
He was a character
in the Flintsteins.

331
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:51,170
Just hiding out till House
leaves the cafeteria.

332
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,043
The self-defense classes,

333
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,379
you think they're making
any kind of difference?

334
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:02,314
Not as much
as House's surprise attacks.

335
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,550
He thinks three steps ahead,
so I do too.

336
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,020
Which is why you should
accept his apology

337
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,455
and come back on the team.

338
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,824
<i>He's annoying,</i>
<i>he's maddening.</i>

339
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:14,160
But he makes us
all better.

340
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,865
Note to self.

341
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:23,636
Foot color's good.

342
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:27,073
Arterial pulse is good.

343
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,808
Capillary refill's good.

344
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,409
And her shoulder pain
is all gone.

345
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:33,612
Looks like you're ready
to go home.

346
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,115
I'll get the car
and meet you out front.

347
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:42,088
I'd say I'm in the book,

348
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:44,525
but not the one you'll be
reading from now on.

349
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,736
Six years ago,
I was a nanny in Honolulu

350
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:59,372
<i>for this beautiful</i>
<i>two-year-old boy.</i>

351
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,607
I loved him.

352
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,543
Probably spent
more time with him

353
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,712
<i>than his own parents.</i>

354
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:12,284
One day I was in the park
talking with another nanny.

355
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:16,688
He wandered out of the sandbox
into the street,

356
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:19,957
into the path
of a moving car.

357
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,028
That could have happened
to anyone.

358
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:26,797
I don't think so.

359
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:29,334
And even if it did,
they'd blame themselves

360
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,602
for the rest
of their lives too.

361
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,507
You shouldn't.

362
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:38,676
You shouldn't run from what
can still be a good life.

363
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,213
I'm running to God.

364
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,014
After what happened to you,

365
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:45,250
don't you wanna
remake your life?

366
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:48,420
Not by hiding myself away.

367
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,191
I hope it works out
for you.

368
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,632
It is gonna be hard.

369
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,868
Not touching anyone.

370
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,233
Who knew mother inferior
was a smoking hottie.

371
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,257
No wonder you're playing
handsies with her.

372
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:55,292
You think I'm hitting
on a nun?

373
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,127
Angry at God or I just
need a challenge?

374
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:00,463
Or you're terrified
of intimacy,

375
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:02,465
which is why
you're a serial slut.

376
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:06,101
But right now you're grasping
at an emotional life raft.

377
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:09,738
Ideally someone for whom
intimacy's not an option.

378
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,673
That actually makes sense,
which I can't say

379
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:12,907
about anything else
you've been doing.

380
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:14,808
I'm not emotionally
involved with her.

381
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,144
And much as I'd love
to hear you contradict me,

382
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,881
I have a 7:30 appointment
to explore my intimacy issues

383
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:22,283
at La Scala.

384
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,887
I'm talking to this agent.
He's a bit of a sleaze.

385
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:28,456
But he's really excited
about representing me.

386
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:30,458
<i>Although he can't take on</i>
<i>any new clients right now,</i>

387
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:31,793
<i>he's trying to get me</i>
<i>an audition</i>

388
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,462
<i>for one of those</i>
<i>online soaps.</i>

389
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:34,697
Have you ever watched
one of those?

390
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:39,536
Am I boring you?

391
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:46,409
Unfortunately, yeah.

392
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:47,910
Sorry.

393
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,559
Hi.

394
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,931
You're not supposed
to be here.

395
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,098
Or anywhere.

396
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,167
Yeah.

397
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,504
You were right.

398
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:16,439
I was running away.

399
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:01,617
Oh, now you're shy.

400
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:07,022
It's brighter
in the morning.

401
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:15,531
So are we gonna spend
the rest of eternity

402
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:18,266
in a lake of fire
while pointy-tailed demons

403
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:20,602
poke at us with sticks?

404
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:26,742
This is a little scary
for me.

405
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,144
I had a whole life planned.

406
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:32,715
Not that I wasn't
struggling with it.

407
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:34,450
And then I met you.

408
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:38,888
Don't worry, I know you're
not the relationship type.

409
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:40,924
I'm not
not the relationship type.

410
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,526
I was married once.

411
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:44,361
[Chuckles]
Relax.

412
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,863
You're fine.

413
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,668
So what's next for you?

414
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,574
I have to find
a place to live.

415
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:58,344
Get my old job back.

416
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:01,714
Sure, I'll feel guilty,
start doubting.

417
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,515
As long as you keep dealing
with your doubts

418
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,417
in the same way then...

419
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,888
Moira?

420
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:12,191
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

421
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,028
Your neck.

422
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,529
What?

423
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,131
Are your ears ringing?

424
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:22,868
Yeah.
What does that mean?

425
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:29,240
We've got to get you back
to the hospital right away.

426
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:30,475
The artery that's bringing
blood to your brain,

427
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:31,709
it's coming apart.

428
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,210
Means you could stroke.

429
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,812
I've paged a team
of our best doctors.

430
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:36,613
I don't have
to cough as much.

431
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,883
It's clotted up.

432
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,451
Is that bad?

433
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:43,254
We're almost there.

434
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,992
<i>Get me her o-two level.</i>

435
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,360
What are you doing?

436
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,128
I want to make sure I can
position her wrist properly.

437
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,730
For what?
A.B.G.

438
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,800
I don't need an A.B.G.
Just get a pulse ox.

439
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,702
I'll do it.
Grab a consent form.

440
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,171
Go!

441
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,840
We need to operate
right now, okay?

442
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,274
Good to operate.

443
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,213
Repeat this, no ifs, ands,
or buts about it.

444
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,249
No about it and no ifs.

445
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,751
Get her into O.R. 11.

446
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:20,147
Carotid dissection,

447
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:22,049
four-inch pulsatile
mass in her neck,

448
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:23,517
<i>and some broca's aphasia.</i>

449
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:24,651
<i>It's got to be a clot</i>

450
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:25,585
keeping her
from bleeding out.

451
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:27,020
Pulse?

452
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:28,155
Bounding, four-plus.

453
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:29,156
It was a three-plus
20 minutes ago.

454
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:31,325
20?

455
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:32,927
Thought she just got here.

456
00:24:35,664 --> 00:24:37,466
That blood
looks pretty dry.

457
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:40,002
Cut yourself shaving?

458
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,271
You know,
that can happen

459
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:45,342
when the nun you woke up with
coughs blood on you.

460
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,911
You slept with a nun?

461
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,946
Forget nun,
you slept with a patient?

462
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:51,748
Former, to both.

463
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:54,083
<i>(House) Internal neck trauma,</i>
<i>that's impressive.</i>

464
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,951
It's happened to me
a few times.

465
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:58,487
Up high.

466
00:24:58,555 --> 00:25:00,388
Dr. Chase.

467
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:04,292
<i>Clot's broken.</i>

468
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,527
Bring her in
and pack her nose.

469
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:06,828
I'm gonna need
number three vicryls.

470
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:09,163
I'm gonna fix this.

471
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,198
You're not gonna
operate on her.

472
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:11,933
Kapur and Carlyle
are unavailable.

473
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,102
Reilly's done far fewer
dissections than I have.

474
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:16,171
He's also slept with her
far fewer times than you have.

475
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:17,505
Your judgment's
compromised.

476
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:18,773
I spent the night with her.

477
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:20,241
Doesn't change
how I make an incision.

478
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:22,443
Tell him!

479
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,915
Do the surgery.

480
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,217
You're trying
to score points with him

481
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:30,419
at the risk
of a patient's life.

482
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,721
He's the better surgeon.

483
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:35,692
(Chase)
Vascular clamp.

484
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,560
You're not gonna put her
on bypass?

485
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:38,761
It'd take a half hour
to set up.

486
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,296
You clamp now,
she could stroke out.

487
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,331
She's already got
neurological symptoms.

488
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:44,667
We wait 30 minutes, she'll
definitely have brain damage.

489
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:47,036
You're trying to make sure
she's either perfect or dead.

490
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:48,304
She's not going to die.

491
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:49,706
If I get this done
in five minutes,

492
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:51,007
she won't stroke out.

493
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:52,175
You don't know
that you will.

494
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:53,476
And you can't know
because you can't

495
00:25:53,544 --> 00:25:56,279
think clearly about her.

496
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,448
Vascular clamp.

497
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:09,125
Occlusion time 9:46
and 23 seconds.

498
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,194
Vascular scissors.

499
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:48,799
We're over five minutes.

500
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:52,002
Ultrasound.

501
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,742
Good flow.
Lighten the anesthesia.

502
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,777
You're not gonna close
the wound first?

503
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:05,413
No.

504
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,422
[Coughs]

505
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:20,063
Can you hear me?

506
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:24,969
Repeat this,

507
00:27:25,037 --> 00:27:27,972
no ifs, ands, or buts.

508
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,109
No ifs, ands, or buts.

509
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:42,821
I'm sorry about before.

510
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,557
You're scared,
aren't you?

511
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,226
That's why you wanted
companionship.

512
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:49,461
That's why you cried out
when House shot at Taub.

513
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:51,530
What exactly
are you scared of?

514
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:53,299
A needle stick?

515
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,334
Some other nut
pulling a scalpel?

516
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:58,937
I'm scared
of everything.

517
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:01,106
It sucks that
there was a stabbing.

518
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:02,674
But you'll get over it.

519
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:04,143
Like you have?

520
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:06,679
You weren't even there.

521
00:28:06,746 --> 00:28:09,382
I know, I--
I left the room.

522
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:10,783
It was pure luck.

523
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:13,886
I was in the room.
That was pure luck too.

524
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:19,592
I get that you're scared
and guilty.

525
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,227
You're still a doctor.

526
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:23,429
I don't have time
to teach you to act like one.

527
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,002
We removed the artery.

528
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,204
I found nodules.

529
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:32,906
Could mean lupus.

530
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:34,006
Negative A.N.A.

531
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:36,376
Where are you going?

532
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:38,544
Great thing
about assigning Taub

533
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:40,580
fraudulent lab work
is you know exactly

534
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:42,548
where he's gonna
end up.

535
00:28:42,615 --> 00:28:44,250
Great thing about
assigning Taub

536
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:46,285
obviously fraudulent
lab work

537
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:48,821
is you get to watch
his inner paranoiac at work.

538
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,566
And then...

539
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,635
Two to the head.

540
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:02,969
Can we talk
about my patient?

541
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:04,571
Quite a journey.

542
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,706
Starts with a surgical tool
in your heart

543
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:08,274
and ends with
a surgeon's tool in a nun.

544
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:09,442
What's the plan?

545
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,111
Plan's to cure her.

546
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:14,081
Well, if it's
not meaningless sex,

547
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:15,849
kinda screams out
for an end game.

548
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:18,118
You're the dog that's
chasing the popemobile.

549
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:19,719
You sure you want--

550
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:22,688
oh, my God.

551
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,860
Taub is interrogating
the janitor.

552
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:31,163
He must think that
I hired him to attack--

553
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,200
actually,
why didn't I do that?

554
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:38,571
Plaques could be confused
for nodules.

555
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:40,572
Which would mean...
Syphilis.

556
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,008
Explains the shoulder
and foot involvement.

557
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:44,910

Boo-yah!

561
00:29:57,556 --> 00:29:59,657
Pfft!

562
00:29:59,725 --> 00:30:01,993
Boo-yah to you too.

563
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,899
But I hadn't
had sex in years.

564
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:09,301
Tertiary syphilis means
you've had the disease

565
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:10,835
for at least that long.

566
00:30:10,903 --> 00:30:13,372
Does that mean
you also have it?

567
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,675
Probably not contagious
at this point.

568
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:21,515
Can it cause
hallucinations?

569
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,584
It's unlikely. Why?

570
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:28,589
While I was
on the operating table,

571
00:30:28,657 --> 00:30:31,192
it didn't feel
like a dream.

572
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,396
I saw the boy
who I was caring for.

573
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:40,166
The one who died.

574
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:43,236
He walked right up to me.

575
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:45,204
What did he say?

576
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:48,474
He just held my hand.

577
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:52,311
It was like
he forgave me.

578
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:54,113
Do you think
that's crazy?

579
00:30:56,117 --> 00:30:59,319
I think it should
give you solace,

580
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:03,424
help you to move on.

581

[Knock at door]

582
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:10,632
You slept
with your patient?

583
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:15,836
You're off the case.

584
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:18,204
I saved her
from brain damage.

585
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,273
You think my judgment's
the least bit compromised?

586
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:21,841
She's still sick.

587
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:23,342
If she dies,
we'll be in the middle

588
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,144
of a brand-new
investigation.

589
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:26,745
This is about you
covering your own ass.

590
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:29,181
I gave you time, leeway,

591
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:31,784
and you decided to do
whatever the hell you wanted.

592
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:33,252
House can dance
all over the rules,

593
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,354
gets me knifed,
and he gets a pass.

594
00:31:35,422 --> 00:31:37,189
I break a rule,
no one gets hurt,

595
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:39,024
but you kick me off
my own case?

596
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:41,527
Unfortunately, yes.

597
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm sorry.

598
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:49,602
I took that scalpel
for you.

599
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:51,370
That's why I did this.

600
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:53,205
Three weeks ago,

601
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:55,274
you never would have
slept with a patient.

602
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:57,776
And you never would have
operated on her after.

603
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:01,079
You need help.

604
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:02,781
I need to get away
from House

605
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:04,582
and everything
that reminds me of him.

606
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,950
By breaking the rules,

607
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:08,219
not caring what
anyone else thinks.

608
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:11,689
You're gonna get away from him
by turning into him?

[Pager beeps]

610
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,800

<i>(Adams)</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

615
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:40,087
This is your liver.

616
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:45,046
The liver failure could be

617
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:47,531
from intraoperative
hypotension.

618
00:32:47,536 --> 00:32:48,754
Checked the anesthesia sheet,

619
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:49,921

throughout.

620

Thrombus?

621
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:52,808
That voice in the hall
that none of us

have any reason
to be listening to

623
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:57,579
is not surprisingly wrong.

Abdominal ultrasound
was negative.

625
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:00,548
Then we have to assume
liver failure

626
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:03,751

Sarcoidosis.

634
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,866
Normal ACE level.

Yeah, Foreman's
clearly wrong.

716
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:23,733
Oh, dear.

717
00:37:24,236 --> 00:37:25,661
You saw God?

718
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:26,729
She did.

719
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:28,522
She wants to go back
to the monastery.

720
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:32,122
So now you're preparing
a Powerpoint presentation

721
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:34,516
to keep her in your garden
of earthly delights.

722
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:36,425
You're an idiot.

723
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:39,629
Because I found someone I love?

724
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:40,700
Because you're an idiot.

725
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:43,657
At least you two
have that in common.

726
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:45,674
Her feelings are based
on a chemical process.

727
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:46,662
They're gonna wear off.

728
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:48,665
You just slept with her.

729
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,682
Your brain is exploding
with oxytocin.

730
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:52,664
You think that's gonna
last through the ages?

731
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:53,673
She's throwing away her life

732
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:54,700
because of blind faith.

733
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:56,636
So are you!

734
00:37:56,637 --> 00:37:57,716
She's found something

735
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:59,716
she wants to build
her life around.

736
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:02,640
It's a total illusion,
but apparently she'll take

737
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:03,683
a little ignorance
with her bliss.

738
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:05,661
And you want to take that away?

739
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:06,677
How many times have
you thrown the truth

740
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:07,712
in people's faces?

741
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:09,636
Because it's the truth,

742
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:12,670
not because we're gonna
live happily ever after.

743
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:15,670
Either your relationship
just blows up

744
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,632
like every other
non-magical romance,

745
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:19,679
or she stays with you
but blames you

746
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,665
for stripping all the meaning
out of her life.

747
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,632
This has nothing to do
with the truth.

748
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,674
You don't like that
I'm reassessing my life,

749
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:29,682
that I want to change it,

750
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:30,707
that I can.

751
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,649
Anyone can screw up a life.

752
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,698
I never said
that wasn't possible.

753
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,695
You're incapable
of human connection,

754
00:38:35,696 --> 00:38:38,724
so you want everyone
to be like you.

755
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:41,671
If I wanted you
to be like me...

756
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,686
I would be urging you

757
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:49,679
to make a stupid,
stubborn decision

758
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,716
that blows up your life and
leaves you lonely and miserable.

759
00:38:59,654 --> 00:39:02,678
You reassess your life
when you've made mistakes.

760
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,658
You didn't.
You just got stabbed.

761
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:07,653
Don't look at the book.

762
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:09,704
I haven't done a jugular line
since my residency.

763
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:11,729
I don't want to needle
the carotid.

764
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:16,700
What's the first step?

765
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:19,699
Palpate the S.C.M.

766
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,711
Where?

767
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,704
Middle third of the neck.

768
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:56,670
I'm happy I knew you.

769
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:59,687
So am I.

770
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:17,691
Robert.

771
00:42:14,683 --> 00:42:16,670
24-year-oldwater treatment worker

772
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:18,675
with pyrexia and double vision.

773
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:42,636
Abscess?

774
00:42:42,637 --> 00:42:44,670
Would have seen it on the MRI.

775
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:47,665
Diphtheria paralyzing
the ocular muscles?

776
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,675
No, paralysis was first.

777
00:42:48,676 --> 00:42:50,654
- Aneurysm?
- Not with this fever.

778
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:52,674
Maybe we're thinking about
this the wrong way.

779
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:53,712
Retro-ocular infection?

780
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:55,654
With no local symptoms?
