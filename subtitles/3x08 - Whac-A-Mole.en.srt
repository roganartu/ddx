Get it yourself.

Nope.

No, it's not. But it could be.

You're a person of interest
in a narcotics investigation.

63
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,080
You're linked to their suspect
and his activities.

You prescribe those?

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,160
He's in chronic pain.
This is obviously
an abuse of power.

Is that a yes or no?

70
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,480
Patients build up
a tolerance over the years.

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,920
Perfect motive for him
to forge those scripts.

What are we, like,

Yeah.

74
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,640
And you suck at it.

75
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,160
Which is really unfortunate,
because you're pretending
to be you.

Yeah, divorce lawyers

of drug enforcement.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You want your car back?

80
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,640
You're gonna have to
give the cops what they want.

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,520
Thanks. Usually people
feel helpless
in these situations.

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,920
Dr. House is
probably going to jail.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,080
You keep on lying for him,
you'll go right along
with him.

84
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,240
House was on this page
when he got that annoying
"I'm such a genius" look.

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
What's there?
Patient history.

86
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,760
He's 18.
Probably drinks,
smokes, does drugs.

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,760
How close am I?

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,800
Quit drugs when
his parents died.
Quit smoking.

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,280
House didn't
mock my viral idea.
He just said it was wrong.

90
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,880
Which means
he didn't want to
give reasons.

91
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,200
Which means
I must have been close.

92
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm thinking bacterial.

93
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm doing a blood culture.

94
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
I am doing an MRI.

95
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,680
If it was a tumor,

96
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,320
intracranial pressure could
cause his brain to
herniate before lunch.

97
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,640
Same thing with
the stress test.

98
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,240
Which is why I'm ditching it.
What are you doing instead?

99
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,400
Not telling.

100
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,280
Seriously?
You're playing his game?

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,120
We're all playing his game.
Might as well enjoy it.

102
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,480
Anybody else sick at work?

103
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,360
I had a stomachache
before him.

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,640
This isn't your fault, Will.
Keep working.

105
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,160
My brother's in the hospital.

106
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
Mrs. Collier won't care
if I finish my homework.

107
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,480
Your brother cares
if you finish your homework.

108
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,240
Can I be your
imaginary friend?

109
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,440
He's a doctor.

110
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,000
How are the feet?
Still itch?

111
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,920
Is that important?
I don't know. Is it?

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,280
What kinds of drugs
you into?

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,840
You don't have to
talk about that right now.

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,880
No, it's okay.

115
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,080
I don't keep secrets
from them.

116
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,280
They know I did drugs
before our parents died.

117
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,920
Clever. Admit the past.
Deny the present.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
I'm clean.

119
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,840
I'm raising two kids.
It'd be pretty irresponsible,
wouldn't it?

120
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,200
But confiding in
an eight-year-old is okay.

121
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,360
If I'm open with them,
then they'll be open with me.

122
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,160
Yeah.
Turning the other cheek's
a good strategy in boxing.

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,960
Kids don't lie because
they got trust issues.

124
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,000
They lie because
they've got something to hide.

125
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,040
Look at him.

126
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,400
He's sitting there
doing nothing
and he's still lying.

127
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,360
We don't lie to Jack.

128
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,480
Spelling test you failed
and forgot to...
No.

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Math test?
No.

130
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,160
Fight with the kid
sitting next to you?
He doesn't sit next to me.

131
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,920
And the other one's
probably having sex.

132
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,680
I am not.
Yet.

133
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,320
But when you start,
you're gonna lie about it.

134
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,400
Colder.
I'm not playing.

135
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,600
Keep very still for me, Jack.
This won't take long.

136
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,200
How much dope did you smoke?

137
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,240
Does he have to be here?
No. Ignore him.

138
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,160
It's not his lungs.
I never said it was.

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,600
What about the cigarettes?
How'd you quit?

140
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,840
Gum? The patch? Hypnosis?

141
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,640
He went from two packs
to nothing, cold turkey.

142
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Or we could just
make small talk.

143
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,520
You still seeing
that nurse in Pedes?

144
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
I just don't think
she's right for you.

145
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,960
You need someone detached,
calculating, ambitious.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,880
You need yourself in a skirt.

147
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Jack, he asked you a question.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
I didn't really quit.
I just sort of
lost taste for it.

149
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,440
Interesting. Sounds like
one of those symptom thingies.

150
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,360
He's still puking,
and he had a heart attack
and itchy feet.

151
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,280
It's not his lungs.
I never said it was.

152
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,000
Ice cold.

153
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm injecting ergonovine
to see if your heart attack

154
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,840
was caused by
a spasm in the vessels
surrounding your heart.

155
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,000
Let me know if
anything feels... unusual.

156
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,360
If the problems are at
my heart, why did that other
doctor look at my brain?

157
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,120
Yeah. Why did
that other doctor
look at his brain?

158
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,760
We're just trying to eliminate
as many possibilities
as we can.

159
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,720
So because you think
that a spasm caused
his heart attack,

160
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,000
you're gonna induce
another spasm?

161
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,680
Did you consent to this?

162
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,280
CAMERON:
Everything's under control.

163
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,760
Tests are gonna identify
which arteries are affected
so we can repair them.

164
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,840
Your meds don't seem
to be doing anything.

165
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,560
So either you're wrong,

166
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,200
or his system hasn't
been pushed enough
to set anything off.

167
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,360
You wanna get back home,
right?

168
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,240
I mean, you're probably
already falling behind with
the housework and the bills.

169
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,880
How many sick days
you think you'll get
before they replace you?

170
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
Heart rate's up. Nothing else.

171
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,600
They can't fire me
if I'm sick.

172
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,640
Right. You're irreplaceable.

173
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,280
Who else would they find
qualified to dance
with a rodent?

174
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,040
How can you even
support your family?

175
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,560
What happens when those kids
grow out of their clothes?
When they get sick?

176
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,200
Still no spasm.

177
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,120
They'll take those kids
away from you, Jack.

178
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,280
Maybe I should bring them
in here right now so that
you can kiss them goodbye.

179
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
Can't you see
his heart is fine!
Stop torturing him!

180
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,320
What kind of doctor are you?

181
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,760
CUDDY: Wonderful.
Thank you so much. Okay, bye.

182
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,920
You're just getting here?
Busses suck.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,320
Where's your car?
It's a hostage.

184
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,520
Tritter wants me to
testify against House.

185
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
You're not going to.

186
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
Is that a question
or an order?

187
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,400
Any sort of conviction
will cost House
his license...

188
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,880
Which will cost
this hospital. Relax.

189
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm not gonna mess
with your precious resource.

190
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,120
I told my lawyer to
tell Tritter to go to hell.
Marco!

191
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
Why are all my prescriptions
getting bounced back?

192
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,400
Sorry, Dr. Wilson.
I was trying to call you.
Where's your phone?

193
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,440
In my car.

194
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
My patients,
on the other hand,

195
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,040
are here and
needed their medications.

196
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm sorry. I can't.
Your DEA number's
been suspended.

197
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,440
<i>HOUSE.: Why so sad?</i>

198
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,240
There's still a chance
that Chase got it right.

199
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,400
(GROANS)

200
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,000
That was suspenseful
for about two seconds.

201
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,880
Blood culture was
negative for bacteria.

202
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
But positive for hepatitis A?

203
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,680
I wonder who could've ordered
that extra test.

204
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
Must be somebody who knew
what persistent vomiting,

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
sudden distaste for nicotine
and itchy feet have in common.

206
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,720
Hep A doesn't explain
the heart attack.

207
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,480
No. But as Chase so deftly
pointed out earlier,
puking does.

208
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,280
And hep A
explains the puking.

209
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,480
If this had been real life
instead of just a game...

210
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,200
The DEA just revoked
my prescription privileges.

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,760
Well, who's gonna
prescribe my Vicodin?

212
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,080
Yes, well,
that's why I'm here.

213
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,560
This is a disaster for you.

214
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,880
Relax.

215
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Tritter's just getting
desperate. He's got
no real evidence.

216
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720
He's trying to
squeeze you into ratting.

217
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm not gonna
let him squeeze my patients.

218
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,320
They'll be fine.
Most of your cancer medicine
sucks anyway.

219
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,040
I'm gonna use your team
to do my prescribing until
this is straightened out.

220
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
Suddenly this doesn't seem
nearly as dramatic.

221
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,040
Go pump IVIG into the kid,
cure him and
get him out of here.

222
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,320
Hep A?
No.

223
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,920
"Chase, blood test
for bacteria.

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
"Foreman, MRI,
too stubborn to
check the lungs.

225
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,160
"Cameron, nice try. No spasm."

226
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,160
"But the princess sat
and sat and sat,

227
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,080
"pretending not to listen."

228
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,800
Pretending to write
in her journal
with the flowers on it.

229
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,600
Pretending she didn't like
stories about eight-year-olds
who save the world.

230
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
I'm 11.

231
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,240
Which is why
you can no longer
save the world.

232
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm eight!
Yeah.

233
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,480
We're all completely
dependent on you.

234
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,800
Morning.
Morning.

235
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,000
Good news.
We can take you off the IVIG.

236
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,080
The hep A has cleared
your system. You'll be good
to go by tomorrow.

237
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,160
How do you think I got it?

238
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,720
Well, it could've been
contaminated food.

239
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,920
It could've been from cleaning
the bathrooms at work.
Or it could've been...

240
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Don't worry.
They've heard it all.

241
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
Anilingus is a common way.

242
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,240
You should just
tell the people
that you've dated

243
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,360
they should get
themselves checked.

244
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,760
Don't worry.

245
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
I've been too busy
chasing after these guys
to go spelunking.

246
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,600
You're gross.

247
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,160
I think.
Does your arm hurt?

248
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,280
Arm's fine, bro.

249
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,960
Then why's it bleeding?
It's not. It's...

250
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,960
Raise your arm
above your head.

251
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,720
Your ear... And your nose...

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,360
FOREMAN: High PT and PTT
on Jack's blood panel
confirm a coagulopathy.

253
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,840
So, we cure the hep A,
something else pops up.

254
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,440
Interesting.

255
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,560
What infections cause DIC?

256
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
You okay?

257
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,520
Hurt my shoulder
playing fantasy football.

258
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,160
Shall we discuss
what causes DIC,

259
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,760
or should we just
send the kid back
to his miserable life?

260
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,800
He's not miserable.
Right.

261
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,080
He's thrilled that
his parents are dead
and his life is over.

262
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,240
The restaurant's probably
teeming with E. Coli,
Eikenella and strep.

263
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,680
Kids don't wash their hands
between the potty
and the party and...

264
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,120
Or it's a food-borne toxin.
Jack eats at that cesspool
every day.

265
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,000
And Jack's the only one
who got sick?

266
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,040
Kid's got tattoos, piercings

267
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,280
and probably
some nasty little girl
who loaned him the hep A.

268
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Could've also given him
syphilis or gonorrhea.

269
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,120
I need one of you.
Take Cameron.

270
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,160
Your idea was dumb anyway.

271
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,480
Chase, I need you to head back
to that cesspool and
get me the kid's puke.

272
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,120
Foreman, do an LP
and have Cameron run down
that potty-party theory.

273
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,160
Why don't I just test him?

274
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,880
Let's not discuss this
in front of the help.

275
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,280
The amount of vomiting
that kid did,

276
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,240
there wouldn't be enough
toxins left in his system
to show up in his blood.

277
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,720
And since he vomited
in the toilet here
instead of on somebody,

278
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,600
that restaurant
is our only source
of essential vomit.

279
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,240
And you couldn't say that
in front of Foreman?

280
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,880
No, I couldn't say this
in front of Foreman.
I need a refill.

281
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,760
Detective Tritter knows about
the scripts I wrote before.

282
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Exactly. If you stop now,
it'll look suspicious.

283
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,000
Does anyone fall
for that argument?

284
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,960
Write the script.

285
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,520
No.

286
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,120
One prescription
isn't gonna make...

287
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,720
We both know
it's not gonna be just one.

288
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,480
I'd rather lose my job
than lose my license.

289
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,080
Daniel Silvers, prostate
cancer. Needs filgrastim,
two-week supply.

290
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,680
Andrea Donovan,
breast cancer.

291
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,080
Just needs her refill
on her megestrol.

292
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000
You're not writing.
You want me to write?

293
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,800
Well, you could phone them in.
But eventually, yeah,

294
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,720
probably somebody's gonna want
something written down.

295
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,160
I haven't met these people.
I have.

296
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,280
I've diagnosed them
and everything.
I know.

297
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,160
I know. I'm not saying
I don't trust you.

298
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,600
Just my diagnoses.

299
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,160
These are gonna be
my prescriptions. I...
They're my patients.

300
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,160
My prescriptions.
My name!

301
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,200
That Tritter will read
on the script.

302
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,280
He wants to make you
miserable. You don't think
he's gonna ask questions?

303
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,480
(SIGHS)

304
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,040
Is there anything Jack does
that no one else does?
Any special duties?

305
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,240
No, we got lots of bussers.

306
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,480
What kind of cleaning products
do you use?

307
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,400
We got a bunch of kids
running around, sticking
everything in their mouths,

308
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,480
so we can't use
anything toxic.

309
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,440
This is it. Monday's trash.

310
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,560
So there's no one
who can maybe help
get the bags out?

311
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
Sorry. Short-handed.

312
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,760
I can tip.

313
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm pretty sure Jack's puke
is in a blue trash bag
with the wrapped gifts,

314
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,320
but if you find spaghetti
that's the wrong vomit.

315
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,240
How much longer
do I have to stay on
this medication?

316
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
I mean, I'm nauseous
all the time.

317
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,200
Maybe I should go back
on the tamoxifen.

318
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,240
You're doing so much better
on the anastrozole, Beth.

319
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,880
I'm reluctant to
make a change.

320
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,720
I can't play with my daughter
or pick her up from school.

321
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,440
I can barely get up
and tuck her in at night.

322
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,000
There's got to be
something else.

323
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,280
Who is she?

324
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,960
Well, as you know,
this is a teaching hospital.

325
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,360
She's a student?
No, I'm a doctor.

326
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm assisting
Dr. Wilson today.

327
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,040
Why? Do you think he got
my diagnosis wrong?

328
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,400
No. I'm sure...
No. No.

329
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,360
She's just consulting
regarding my prescriptions.

330
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,960
You think he got
my meds wrong?
No. It's just...

331
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,240
No.
Then why is she here?

332
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,720
What are you doing now?

333
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,040
I'm gonna get a sample
of your brother's
spinal fluid.

334
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,040
Where's Will?
School.

335
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
Is that gonna hurt?

336
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,480
It's gonna help us figure out
what's making him sick.

337
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,080
Shouldn't you be
in class, too?
Teacher work day.

338
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,560
For you but not Will?

339
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,840
Yeah, didn't make
sense to me, either.

340
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,200
Can I help?

341
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,760
Well, I guess it's quicker
than calling a nurse
and a truant officer.

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,640
Okay, grab his shins
and push his knees up
towards his chest.

343
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,360
Now hold him there tight.

344
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,160
This all nurses do?

345
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,880
My boss doesn't trust them
to do anything else.

346
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,320
(JACK GROANING)

347
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,840
Is he gonna die?

348
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
No. No one's gonna die.

349
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,160
In the whole world ever?
That's so great.

350
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,880
I meant...
I know what you meant.

351
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,600
But I also know
bad things do happen.

352
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,120
My dad always had a few drinks
when they went out.

353
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,840
Always said
he'd be okay to drive.

354
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,040
Until he wasn't.

355
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,000
I would just like
some warning this time.

356
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,520
We're nowhere near
anything like that
happening right now. Okay?

357
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,080
Let's get him back over.

358
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,680
(JACK SCREAMS)

359
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,440
What was that?

360
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,600
What did you do?

361
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,760
You broke his rib?
I barely touched him.

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,040
Which means...

363
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,080
(GROANS)

364
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
Found it.
Fix it.

365
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,640
Osteomyelitis.
Means the infection's
spread to his bones,

366
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,640
which means
it's either bacterial
or viral and not...

367
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,040
(GROANS)

368
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,960
I hired you to
take away the pain.
Was there some confusion?

369
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,520
Ever thought about
using your cane
on the proper side?

370
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,880
Yeah, that's the issue.

371
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,280
Friday night my cane
suddenly noticed
it was on the wrong side.

372
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,600
Can you score me some Vicodin?
No.

373
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,600
I did a needle aspiration
to confirm which...
How long till the culture's...

374
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,000
(SCREAMS)

375
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,720
Why do you only do that
when I'm talking?

376
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,600
You gotta rest your shoulder.

377
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,800
And we're gonna get you
on some different equipment.

378
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,400
Nice cane.
If I know what you mean.

379
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,000
Chase, you can stop
doing that.
I'm almost finished.

380
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,880
He's got osteomyelitis.

381
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,320
Means you're wrong
about food-borne toxins.

382
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,720
And you can stop, too.
It's syphilis.

383
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,160
You sure?
Read the print out.

384
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,200
He's also positive
for Eikenella.

385
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,640
One of you two screwed up.
No.

386
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,160
Not a chance.

387
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,160
Or this kid is a lot sicker
than we thought.
Finish that test.

388
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,440
Should be impossible
to get two right answers
to one question.

389
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,400
It's okay to have three?
Apparently.

390
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,320
CHASE: He's positive
for botulism, too.

391
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,560
So, we knock down
one infection and
three more pop up.

392
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,920
I think this game is rigged.

393
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,680
Jack?

394
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,720
Somebody help!

395
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,200
FOREMAN: We've managed to
clear all three infections
out of his system,

396
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,040
but now he's having seizures
every few hours.

397
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,480
He's gotta be
immunocompromised.
No.

398
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,800
White count was normal,
and he was negative for HIV.

399
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,000
Well, if he's not
immunocompromised,

400
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,760
why is he acting like
he's immunocompromised?

401
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,560
HOUSE: What do
the seizures tell us?
Nothing.

402
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,600
There were no structural
abnormalities on the CT,

403
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,560
nonfocal neuro exam,
no electrolyte imbalance.
Nothing.

404
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,720
What do unexplained seizures
and really sick 18-year-olds
have in common?

405
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,040
You thinking trauma?
I'm thinking drugs.

406
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,960
He's an admitted user.
The drugs trashed
his immune system.

407
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,680
Tox screen was clean.

408
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,920
Clean tox screen means
there's no drugs
in his blood or urine.

409
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,920
There could still be drugs
trapped in his fat cells
from the good old days.

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,440
If they're in his fat,
why would they be
affecting him now?

411
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,200
The keen observer would notice
that he's had some
digestive issues lately.

412
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,480
His weight loss
could've burned off fat cells

413
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,080
and released the drugs
back into his system.

414
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,160
FOREMAN: There's no way
to know. It's impossible to
test fat cells for drugs.

415
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,560
But it's not impossible
to make him lose more weight.

416
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,840
You want us to starve him
so we can drive him
into another seizure?

417
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,560
Maybe a heart attack?
Just so we can run
another tox screen?

418
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,480
That'd be cruel.
Just sweat it out of him.

419
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,160
I haven't touched a thing
since the night
my parents died.

420
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,520
Drugs stay in your system
a long time.

421
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,080
I was high the night
the cops came to
tell us what happened.

422
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,360
You know the first thing I did
when they told me?

423
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,520
I laughed.

424
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,320
I'm not the person
I was when they died.

425
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,080
I wish they could see that.

426
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,200
Well, I'm sure
they're watching,
and I'm sure they're proud.

427
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,920
That's what Will's
guidance counselor
keeps telling him.

428
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
What do you tell him?

429
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,680
I tell him it's crap.

430
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,920
Our parents live on
in our memories,
but they don't live on.

431
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,240
CHASE: Jack?
CAMERON: Hold him still.

432
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,160
Don't break his arm.
CAMERON: We'll fix it.

433
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,920
We need to get a sample.

434
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,040
House.

435
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,720
Bad news.

436
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,120
Look at you.

437
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,600
You couldn't have sent
Cameron down here to
this air-conditioned hallway

438
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,600
to deliver the bad news?

439
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,000
Jack seized again,
but his blood was clean.
Completely drug free.

440
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,120
So he just happened to have
a seizure at the exact time
that we stuck him in a sauna?

441
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,240
It's not a coincidence.

442
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,000
He's still seizing every
few hours whether we stick
him in a sauna or not.

443
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,200
Oh, my God!
Why are you using that?

444
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,200
I've had it for years.

445
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,320
No, that's...
That's gonna make
your shoulder hurt.

446
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,920
You need one of these.

447
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,280
He's a doctor.

448
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,400
Is he still infection-free?
I'm sure not for long.

449
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,920
My point being that something
other than those infections
caused these seizures.

450
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,520
Means there's something
in his head. Scan him.

451
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,320
We scanned him.
Well, that was then.
This is not then.

452
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,520
Kid keeps changing.
Scan him again.

453
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,040
Where is Cameron?

454
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,160
I am not writing you
a script for Vicodin.

455
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
I've only got two pills left.

456
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,880
Cut them in half.
Then you'll have four.

457
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,520
You're prescribing for Wilson.
Wilson prescribes for me.

458
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,880
Write up a script.

459
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,840
You know
you have a problem.
Yeah.

460
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,160
It's got a badge
and everything.

461
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,840
You're taking too much...
Fine! You're right.

462
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,480
What's the correct amount?
Write up a script
for the correct amount.

463
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,400
No answer? That's 'cause
we're having the wrong debate.

464
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,480
This has got nothing
to do with my problem

465
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,080
and everything to do with you
avoiding a problem.

466
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,840
You're afraid that
if you write me a prescription

467
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,960
you're gonna wind up
like Wilson.

468
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,520
Of course I am.

469
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,560
Tritter wants to win
by giving pain.

470
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,680
Do you really want
to be a part of that?

471
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,800
As a doctor,
how do you do that?

472
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,760
Here.

473
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,960
This'll tide you over.
Takes the edge off my PMS.

474
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,760
Should do wonders for you.

475
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,320
Why are you
looking at my head again?

476
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,320
Seizures usually indicate
something neurological.

477
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm not gonna get better.

478
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,120
Am I?

479
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,520
We'll know more
after the test.

480
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,520
I've gotta find out
who can take care of
Will and Kama.

481
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,840
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

482
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,400
You'll be home yelling at them
and kicking their butts
before you know it.

483
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,480
(FOREMAN SIGHS)

484
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,440
This kid might be facing
a terminal disease,

485
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,440
and he's more worried
about his brother and sister.

486
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,160
CHASE: Brain stem's clean.

487

Nothing in the midbrain.
What's that?

00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,840
The frontal lobe,
upper-right quadrant.

489
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,320
I don't see anything.
There.

490
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,000
It's tiny,
but I think it's a tumor.

491
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,600
That size should be excisable.
Why didn't we see it earlier?
How could...

492
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,960
Oh, God!

493
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
Axial view.
There's another one.

494
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,640
Bring up the next slice.

495
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,520
They're everywhere.

496
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,240
Jack's brain is
riddled with tumors.

497
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,920
And you know what he's doing?
Moaning?

498
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,480
Setting up play dates.
Wow, what a guy. Theories?

499
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,760
The obvious one,
brain cancer destroyed
his immune system,

500
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,560
left him wide open
for these infections.

501
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,760
House, you're pathetic.

502
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,360
You'll analyze
anyone's faults,
hypocrisies, weaknesses,

503
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,560
but this kid's
got some strength,

504
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,520
and all of a sudden
there's no time to talk about
anything but the medicine.

505
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,520
He's teaching pre-pubescent
kids that truth matters,
God doesn't and life sucks.

506
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,200
I like him. Treatment?

507
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,120
We need to
start him on radiation.

508
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,200
That'll destroy
whatever's left of
his immune system.

509
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,200
FOREMAN: And save his life!

510
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,640
I know the notion
of self-sacrifice
is foreign to you...

511
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,240
You wanna think that he's
sacrificing himself because
if one person can do it,

512
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,040
then maybe the world
isn't the cold, selfish place
you know that it is.

513
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,600
Radiation could kill him.
Alternatives?

514
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,000
There aren't any.
We saw the tumors...

515
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,440
We could choose
to say they aren't tumors.

516
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,560
They're just pus, which
would explain why they
weren't there yesterday.

517
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,160
It can't be an infection.
He got IVIG,

518
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,880
broad-spectrum antibiotics...
Exactly.

519
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,440
Creates a perfect world
for fungus, moves in,
gets married,

520
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
has little fungi...

521
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,000
If you're wrong about
the fungus, you're wasting
what little time he has left.

522
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,480
Not a big sacrifice.
His life sucks.

523
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,560
So let's be right.
Go stick a needle
in the kid's head.

524
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
If you suck out a liquid,

525
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,160
then I'm right
and we haven't
answered anything.

526
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,160
If you suck out a solid,
you're right and no more
worrying about play dates.

527
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,040
Okay. Fine.
I'll father your child.

528
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,080
First, you got to write me
a Vicodin prescription,

529
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,680
just so I can
get through the foreplay.

530
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,960
How many days
do you have left?

531
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,640
Could probably get through
maybe the next minute or so.

532
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,040
And your coming to me means
your lackeys actually
stood up to you.

533
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,160
I'm impressed.

534
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Yes, their cowardice
is inspiring.

535
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,120
Well, you should be
thanking them.

536
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,120
If they caved,
it'd give the cops evidence

537
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,120
that you intimidated
underlings to
feed your addiction.

538
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,960
I hate writing
thank-you notes.

539
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,720
Would it be weird if I asked
Cameron to write them?
You're hooking me up?

540
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,680
Unfortunately,
if I cut you off,
it'd give the cops evidence

541
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,040
that you don't really
need the pain meds.

542
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,560
I knew that cleavage
was a smokescreen.
You're a genius.

Yeah.

Any big changes
in your life recently?

They were abscesses
from a fungal infection.
Aspergillus.

FOREMAN: But we still have
no idea why.

has a factory defect.

HOUSE: It's genetic.
It can't be genetic.

560
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,840
He would've been
getting infections
since he was an infant.

561
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,080
Not if he grew up in a bubble.
Or if he grew up on Mars.

562

No germs there, either.
I don't mean a literal bubble.

Question is, which one?

567
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,960

he's contracted

What does it tell us?

578
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,560
It could mean
chronic granulomatous disease.

579
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,400
And the aspergillus is
a T cell issue. Common
variable immunodeficiency.

gonna take time.

is to make me sicker?

And how are you
gonna know which one
gains the most ground?

Well, that's the fun part.

See, if the meningococcus
is king of the hill, you get
to have another seizure.

596
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,200
Serratia will shut down
your lungs. If it's cepacia,
you'll have a heart attack.

597
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,000
And if it's the rhinovirus,
you'll sneeze.

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,920
Except when
it comes to people.

662
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,800
Everything we've learned
about this kid says
you're wrong.

663
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,000
But you can't accept that.

664
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,440
It's easy to
reject the diagnosis.

665
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,040
Not so easy to
reject your misanthropy,

666
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,160
because then
you'd have to give people
a fighting chance.

667
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,040
And that scares
the crap out of you.

668
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,120
Okay.

669
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,240
Let's get some evidence.

670
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,120
It's your lucky day.

671
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,440
HOUSE: Just found another
donor in the registry.
Perfect match.

672
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,200
We can do the transplant
with no danger to the rug rat.

673
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,840
Just have to sign here.

674
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,880
Unless there's another reason
you don't want it.

675
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
There's a chance I'd die.

676
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,880
A chance you'll be cured.

677
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,040
Maybe you don't
want that, either.

678
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,160
Maybe hanging out in
a hospital getting waited on
hand and foot

679
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,280
reminds you of what life used
to be like before you were
forced to play Mister Mom.

680
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,120
I don't like being sick.

681
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,560
But you don't want
to be healthy, either.

682
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,640
This is your way out.

683
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
Guilt free.

684
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,440
I said I'd do it
when Will's 18.

685
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,200
And he's able to take care
of himself without you.

686
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,200
Jack, your brother
and sister need you.
I know!

687
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,560
I know every second of
every day that they need me,

688
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
but I'm too young
to be their dad.

689
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,800
Good for you.

690
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,880
Don't pretend
you're surprised.

691
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,480
Want to go throw stuff
at people off the balcony?

692
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,000
Come on. Mail can wait.

693
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,840
I'm referring my patients
to other oncologists.

694
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,280
I'm shutting down my practice.
Oh, good.

695
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,960
'Cause I was afraid
you might overreact.

696
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,640
I can't just ask
my patients to wait

697
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,240
because Dr. Cameron's boss
won't let her come out
and play!

698
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,040
I kept you waiting
for maybe an hour...
Three hours!

699
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,160
Anybody die?
Not this time.

700
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,160
Cameron's available now.
Use her all you want.

701
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,680
So now's a better time for me
to have my life taken away?

702
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,440
It fits into
your schedule better?
Oh, poor you.

703
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,680
Think if you suffer
loudly enough...
You committed a crime!

704
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,160
What do you want me to do?
Turn myself in?

705
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,560
Yes! Yes! Do something!
Go in! Show some remorse!

706
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,000
Tell Tritter
you'll get some help!

707
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,600
I don't need help!

708
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,320
House, get out of here.
Get out of here.

709
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,480
You are not gonna make me
feel guilty about what
Tritter is doing to us.

710
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,040
(SCOFFS)

711
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,640
You already feel guilty.

712
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,200
Your mysterious shoulder pain
isn't coming from your cane.

713
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
It's coming from
your conscience.

714
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,720
That used to be enough.

715
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,920
Despite all
your smartass remarks,
I knew you gave a damn.

716
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,320
This time...

717
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,800
You were either gonna
help me through this
or you weren't.

718
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,560
I got my answer.

719
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,920
Who's gonna
drive me to school,

720
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,840
help me with my homework?

721
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,080
There'll be a mom
where they take you.

722
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,160
A real mom,
someone who can cook.

723
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,760
Don't worry.
I'll still be able to
see you guys.

724
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,240
You said
you'd make him better.

725
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,760
I'm sorry.

726
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,720
Thank you
for not telling them.

727
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,840
You're a good kid.

728
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,120
Three months from now,
six months from now,

729
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,000
you'll be visiting them
and you won't be able
to say goodbye.

730
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
You're gonna know
you screwed up.

731
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,320
You'll take his bone marrow
and you'll take them back.

732
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,360
And they'll be a burden
and a pain,

733
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,200
and your life will never be
what it was supposed to be.

734
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,560
But you'll be proud
of yourself.

735
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,240
And your parents,
they'll be proud of you.

736
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,280
I don't think so.

737
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,560
(SIGHS)

738
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,720
It's what I wanna believe.
