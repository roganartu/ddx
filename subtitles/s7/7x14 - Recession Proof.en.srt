nice for my girlfriend.

185

You never do anything
unless it stands to benefit you.

186
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,429
I realize that three
failed marriages

187
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:34,697
can leave a man
twisted and bitter inside,

188
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:36,466
but in a good relationship,

189
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,302
people sometimes do things
for each other.

190
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,005
A hundred says
you don't show up.

191

You're giving me an incentive
to actually show up?

192

A personal,
selfish incentive?

193

00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:26,983
I can't tell if you're
being passive-aggressive

or this is just your regular
fun-loving personality.

Both. And you can
keep the tie.

We think you're suffering

Which is causing the rash.

218

We need to decontaminate

Acid exposure burns literally.
It shouldn't be causing this.

<i>We have to get</i>

If it gets any higher,

227
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:41,424
it could cause permanent
brain damage.

228
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,324

Problem's not boric acid.

<i>Maybe we're thinking</i>
