this patient came in,
50-year-old guy,

we discover that his stomach
is filled with cancer.

681
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:47,890
So instead of telling him

682
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,058
that he's gonna look great
at the beach,

683
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:50,259

that he's dying.

And while it was happening,

696
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:22,726
I kept thinking about
that patient

I was like him.

Completely justified.

702
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,563

It didn't help.
