I'm sure they're fine.

00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,125

They're spending time
together.

7
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:25,498
It's good.

8
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,500

They need to bond.

Yeah, well...

10
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:33,023

Smallpox was eradicated

<i>Was the ship sunk in water?</i>

45

Because viruses can't survive
contact with water.

If the virus had been kept on
the outside of an airtight jar,

47
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:49,209
that might be an issue.

48
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,361
The jar held old-school

49
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:53,864
They kept the scabs

<i>One possibility is tetanus</i>

76
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,597
I remember
tetanus shots.

77
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,632
That does not look
like tetanus shots.

78
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,317
It's really not worth
going into,

79
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:05,652

are astronomical.

80
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:09,439
Tell me.

81
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:12,609
Again, it's--

82
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:15,395
smallpox.

83
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:16,529
Smallpox?

84
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:21,167
The vaccine will protect you
if you don't have it

85
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:23,787
<i>and lessen the severity
if you already do.</i>

86
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,372
B-but it's
a billion-to-one, so...

87
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,924
We don't want you to panic

88
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:29,575
<i>How do I not panic</i>

00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:41,554

You're not scheduled

93
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:47,928
I had some free time.
I owed four hours.

94
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:49,396
Don't you have a case?

95
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:51,264
Yeah.
Then don't worry about it.

96
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:54,234
Are you a Stepford doctor?

97
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,320
If you're busy,
you don't need to be down here.

98
00:06:57,388 --> 00:06:58,371
You're serious.

99
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,107
Yep. Get out of here.

100
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:06,146
I can't.

101
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:08,415
I forgot her
stuffed animal at home.

102
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:09,615
It's been with her

103
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,234
through all
the chemo sessions so far.

104
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:12,919
I need Lamby.

105
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,671
<i>He doesn't want me

106
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:17,223
<i>Honey,
there's no other way.</i>

107
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,975
You're just gonna
have to be brave, okay?

108
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:20,977
<i>What if I get someone
to sit with her</i>

109
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:23,079
while you run home
and get Lamby?

110
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:26,599
I'll get a nurse.

111
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,568
Then I have to deal
with a...

112
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:31,154
Very sick man.

113
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:41,298
I think she knows.

114
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,867
Who is she,
and what does she know?

115
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:46,786
Cuddy. And...
that I faked a lab test

116
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:48,738
and lied to her
to save my last patient.

117
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:50,707
What did she do?

118
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,626
She let me out of clinic duty
by saying I had a case.

119
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,161
She's never done that.

120
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:57,597
She's also probably
never ordered the pasta special

121
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:58,882
in the cafeteria.

122
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:00,967
Would that also have

123
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:02,552
<i>some special paranoid message
to send you?</i>

124
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:04,003
I am not imagining this.

125
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:06,306
It's an aberration in the way
that she treats me.

126
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:07,774
How do I find out
what it means?

127
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,109
<i>You don't.</i>

128
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:10,393
If she doesn't know,
all you're gonna do

129
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:11,811
by sniffing around
is make her suspicious.

130
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:13,897
If she does know,
you'll find out soon enough.

131
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:16,032
What if I die of curiosity
in the meantime?

132
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,151
You were an idiot for lying
to her in the first place.

133
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:20,370
Don't be more
of an idiot now.

134
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:22,989
Say nothing to no one
about anything.

135
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,857
That includes me.

136
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,217
It's not smallpox.

137
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,386
Blood work suggests
some other infection.

138
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:38,555
White count is way down.

139
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,808
Masters,
have you got a boyfriend?

140
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:43,560
That's none
of your business.

141
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:45,211
Ah, probably just
a dry spell.

142
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:47,597
House, you do realize

143
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:49,349
we just ruled out smallpox?

144
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,986
Would you ever be extra nice
to a theoretical boyfriend

145
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:54,621
<i>if you were
really mad at him?</i>

146
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:57,690
I guess the only reason
I would be extra nice

147
00:08:57,742 --> 00:09:00,160
is because I'm angry,
and I just want him to go away

148
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:02,846
so I don't have to deal
with him anymore.

149
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:05,014
You passive/aggressive bitch.

150
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:06,583
You just asked me--

151
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,835
what about Foreman's
unnecessary tests?

152
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,236
Negative for varicella
and measles.

153
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,538
So all of our ideas
are off the table.

154
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:13,706
I'm putting mine back on.

155
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:15,458
<i>Patient's a diver.</i>

156
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:17,377
Under increased pressure,
everything in the blood

157
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:19,462
<i>gets scared, panics,
runs, and hides.</i>

158
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,131
Antibodies could be
in the joints.

159
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:22,949
Tap her knee, ankle,
shoulder,

160
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:26,219
and any other joint
in her smallpox-ridden body.

161
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,437
Good talk.

162
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:44,204
You know.

163
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:45,989
Of course I know.

164
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:48,274
Oh, thank God.

165
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:51,044
I thought I was just
being paranoid.

166
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:53,446
Why didn't you
say something?

167
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:55,665
'Cause I wanted you
to come to me and apologize.

168
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:58,902
I can't apologize if
I haven't done anything wrong.

169
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,253
You lied to my face.

170
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:01,454
To do my job,

171
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:03,840
<i>to save a patient's life.</i>

172
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:05,892
Look, I don't want to go
all Godfather on you.

173
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,594
This was business.

174
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:09,929
I wouldn't lie to you
about something personal.

175
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,849
Well, you don't get to lie
to me about anything.

176
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,869
I can't compartmentalize
my life like that.

177
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:19,022
Well, maybe you should practice,
'cause it comes in handy.

178
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,830
I think you should go.

179
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:39,825
Ow.

180
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:41,678
Sorry.

181
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:44,514
I have to get the needle
behind the bone.

182
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:46,633
I'm running
out of bones.

183
00:10:46,684 --> 00:10:48,384
If this is a waste
of time--

184
00:10:48,452 --> 00:10:49,602
last one.

185
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,938
You just have to be...

186
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,340
What?

187
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,393
<i>What--what is it?</i>

188
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:02,732
I'm sorry.
I have to call the .

189
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,951
I think you do have
smallpox.

190
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:14,860
Am I gonna die?

191
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:16,528
I mean, this is what
terrorists want to use

192
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:17,896
to kill everyone, right?

193
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,531
Like, there's no cure.

194
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:22,384
There are treatments.
We can give you cidofovir.

195
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:25,404
I don't think you care
about the drugs' names.

196
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:26,705
Bottom line--
it's 30% fatal,

197
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,657
<i>which means your chances
of being okay</i>

198
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:30,792
are about the same
as a basketball player's chance

199
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:32,160
at hitting a free throw,

200
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:36,048
unless she finds dark,
purplish skin blotches.

201
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,250
What would
purple blotches mean?

202
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:40,636
Hemorrhagic-type smallpox.

203
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,754
In which case,
her chances are more like...

204
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:45,307
Shaq hitting a free throw.

205
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,926
Well, no purple skin,
but take a look at this.

206
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:49,328
What is it?

207
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:51,763
There's a rash under
your daughter's arm.

208
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:54,399
Like more of those
gross bumps?

209
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:59,771
No. It's just
a regular rash.

210
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,639
W-what does that mean?

211
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:04,976
It means it's not smallpox.

212
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:15,170
Are you saying
you see House's side?

213
00:12:15,254 --> 00:12:19,091
It's not even a side.
It's a fictional construction.

214
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:20,926
She's expecting House
not to lie?

215
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:22,294
If she's using
the relationship

216
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:24,129
as a rationale
to try to change things--

217
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,830
Wait. Wait.
Are you saying

218
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:27,716
it's okay for us
to lie to each other?

219
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,201
No, we have
a different relationship--

220
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:30,602
I think a better one.

221
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:32,387
Lying was never part of it.
Theirs is built on it.

222
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:34,890
Sorry, I have to go.

223
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:37,225
Oh, come on, I have to leave
in, like, five minutes.

224
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,843
Can't it wait?
There's a little girl.

225
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:40,195
The nurse watching her
got called away.

226
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,699
It's a long story,
but I've got to babysit.

227
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:45,901
I'll see you tonight.
Mm-hmm.

228
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:48,904
<i>Attention--
effective immediately,</i>

229
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,655
<i>all hospital entrances
and exits will be restricted</i>

230
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:52,591
<i>until further notice.</i>

231
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:53,959
<i>Center for Disease Control
has ordered</i>

232
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,193
<i>Princeton Plainsboro Hospital
locked down.</i>

233
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,329
Well, I guess
I can stay.

234
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,538
Please step out of the room.

235
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,012
I'm Dr. Broda,
head of infection control, .

236
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:16,064
And your protective suits
are not adequate.

237
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:17,933
Turns out
they don't have to be.

238
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:20,652
Rash under the arm
means it's not smallpox.

239
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,771
False alarm. Sorry.

240
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:25,190
Hope the traffic
wasn't too bad.

241
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:26,525
Rash is consistent
with smallpox.

242
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:28,193
Not if it presents
after pustules.

243
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:29,945
<i>She's probably just allergic
to the bedsheets</i>

244
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,247
or the hospital gown,
and you simply didn't notice it.

245
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:34,866
We're gonna airlift blood
and tissue samples to Atlanta.

246
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:37,252
We'll have the DNA results
in 18 hours.

247
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:39,671
In the meantime, please,

248
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,056
step out of the room.

249
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:43,458
You brought the plane?
Cool.

250
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:48,964
<i>When we left, Julie's fever</i>

251
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,582
had climbed to over 103.

252
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,184
It's not smallpox.
She's not dying.

253
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:53,452
And it's not our case.

254
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,903
Need any other reasons
to forget it?

255
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,921
You know how you can tell
there's nothing to be done?

256
00:13:56,973 --> 00:13:59,508
Chase showed up.
I was here at 9:00.

257
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:01,693
So you guys just want to do
nothing for the next 18 hours

258
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,612
until they tell us
it's not smallpox?

259
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:05,480
Can't we spend the time
discussing

260
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:08,867
what looks like smallpox
but isn't smallpox?

261
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:10,902
Molluscum contagiosum.

262
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,537
You have to compare lesions
to differentiate.

263
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:13,622
But we don't have access
to the patient

264
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:14,956
or any new information.

265
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,292
But we do have access
to the other patients--

266
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:20,662
the ones who died
of the same thing in 1793.

267
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:23,915
<i>It's the Captain's log
from the Sotos Ooslerzoon.</i>

268
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:27,335
<i>Maritime Museum in Bermuda
graciously sent over a pdf.</i>

269
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,786
Problem solved.

270
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:33,191
I assume at least one of you
speaks fluent Dutch.

271
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,560
<i>It's the middle of the night
in the Netherlands.</i>

272
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:36,678
Nobody's working.

273
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:39,514
Oh, you can always
find someone.

274
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,850
Oh, yes.
My name is Geerte.

275
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:43,568
<i>Are you handsome,</i>

276
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:45,103
sexiest American man?

277
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:47,522
You know, some people--

278
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:51,109
I would say
that I am, yeah.

279
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,977
I want you to translate
something for me.

280
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,479
<i>Why you want I translate?</i>

281
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:58,583
I do topless,
toys, and--

282
00:14:58,651 --> 00:14:59,951
just do the translation.

283
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:02,120
She can translate however
she feels most comfortable.

284
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:03,788
<i>Whatever.</i>

285
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,408
You put in credit card.

286
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:07,959
House, the hospital
has translators on call--

287
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,661
Shut up.

288
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:14,666
Honey, could you email
our new friend

289
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:17,836
the Captain's log?
Sure thing...

290
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:21,473
Sexiest American man.

291
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:25,060
"On morning of 14, July,

292
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:30,048
<i>I boarded Sotos Ooslerzoon
with two trunks and my cat."</i>

293
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:32,017
Aw!
The Captain had a cat.

294
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:33,985
Isn't she adorable?

295
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:35,353
<i>Go ahead and skip
to the part</i>

296
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,022
<i>where people get sick.</i>

297
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:38,823
Mm...Ah, here.

298
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:42,827
"The passenger has a fever,
shaking, and red eyes."

299
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,431
Ooh. Also African man
make go in his pants.

300
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:49,334
What about the Captain,
the crew?

301
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:52,237
Mm, no. It say only
African men sick.

302
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:54,756
It can't be smallpox.

303
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,375
Airborne transmission

304
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:59,644
means it's
an equal-opportunity killer.

305
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:01,646
We're looking for a disease
that discriminates.

306
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:03,014
Sickle cell.

307
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,482
The disease
doesn't have to be racist.

308
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,884
It could be classist.

309
00:16:05,952 --> 00:16:08,286
<i>Vitamin "D" deficiency
from lack of sunlight</i>

310
00:16:08,354 --> 00:16:10,088
<i>weakens the immune system,
makes the slaves</i>

311
00:16:10,156 --> 00:16:11,973
more vulnerable to malaria
or dengue fever.

312
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,992
I don't know how you get
pustules from any of those.

313
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:15,777
Captain and crew
got clean drinking water.

314
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:18,897
<i>Slaves drank
whatever they could.</i>

315
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:21,533
Scrofula.

316
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:24,286
<i>That's what they called
cervical T.B. lymphadenitis</i>

317
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,954
in the 1700s.

318
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:27,339
Scrofulicious--

319
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:29,791
that's what they called
"annoying" in the 1700s.

320
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:30,959
Is she wrong?

321
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:35,180
Then they died for nothing.

322
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:38,550
Those slaves could have led
long, fulfilling lives

323
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:40,418
mowing my ancestors' lawns.

324
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:42,220
<i>Foreman.</i>

325
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,189
Can I speak to you
outside for a second?

326
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:52,063
We need to test for T.B.

327
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:53,698
T.B. Might fit,

328
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:56,401
but it's too slow-moving
to kill her anytime soon.

329
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,536
There's no way the CDC's
gonna give us access.

330
00:16:58,604 --> 00:17:00,538
That's why
we don't think it's T.B.

331
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:02,490
We think it's
meningococcal disease,

332
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:04,793
which could kill her
before the results come back.

333
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:07,746
And once I gain access,
I run the T.B. test.

334
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:09,781
You could have said
all that in there.

335
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,616
In front of the narc?
As if.

336
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:13,518
Are you so afraid
of this new girl,

337
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,053
we have to take
elaborate measures

338
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,172
every time you want to skirt
around ethical boundaries?

339
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:19,457
Elaborate measures?
We took a walk--

340
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,676
a walk you
would have taken anyway.

341
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:24,396
Actually, I saved you
from the horrible

342
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:26,681
post-differential
traffic jam.

343
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:31,936
Meningococcus.

344
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:33,521
We believe the rash
under Julie's armpit

345
00:17:33,606 --> 00:17:36,024
is actually
petechial spots.

346
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:37,692
When added to the high fever,
the vomiting--

347
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,361
there haven't been
any seizures, no stiff neck.

348
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,446
If I could just gain access
to the patient,

349
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:42,814
I can investigate
the rash further.

350
00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:44,115
I'll take a look.

351
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:45,734
I can wear your gear.

352
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:48,486
I'll take every
necessary precaution.

353
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:50,455
You come to me
with a weak diagnosis.

354
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:52,390
I even offer to investigate,

355
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,492
<i>but that's not
good enough for you.</i>

356
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:57,545
What's really going on here?

357
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:04,869
Sir...

358
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:06,137
<i>Are you feeling
all right in there?</i>

359
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:09,357
It's just a headache.

360
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:12,844
Baby.

361
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:14,779
<i>Baby.</i>

362
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,199
<i>Dad...</i>

363
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:19,567
You're bleeding.

364
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:20,952
Somebody, please...

365
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,187
<i>Get in here now!</i>

366
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,411
This is not meningococcus.

367
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:32,163
You're not getting in here.

368
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:38,201
Cool.
Not really--not for them

369
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:39,736
and not for you--
the dad's new symptoms

370
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:41,338
are consistent
with them having smallpox.

371
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:43,457
Would be
if he had a headache.

372
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:44,891
He does have a headache.

373
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,660
No. He just said, "ow,"
and held his head.

374
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:47,878
<i>Actually, he said, "ow."</i>

375
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:49,796
Then he said,
"it's a headache."

376
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:52,048
Which could be indicative
of head pain.

377
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,885
<i>Headache is caused by muscle
tension or vascular stretching.</i>

378
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:57,070
Head pain is caused by trauma,
which would include

379
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:59,639
such events as a bleed
in the brain from T.B.

380
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:02,209
We're back to T.B.?
We never left.

381
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:03,927
<i>We'll need to do a C.T.</i>

382
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,462
And I sort of have a hunch
that the CDC's

383
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,030
not gonna approve
of us moving the patient.

384
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:12,102
Chase, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

385
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:18,358
You just tried this.

386
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:20,527
I'm not a better liar than Foreman.
Sure, you are.

387
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,329
You're descended
from convicts.

388
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,230
Plus, there's no lie
this time.

389
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:25,582
It's a bait and switch.

390
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,284
You propose that we
don't have to move him

391
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:28,919
if we do
a pneumoencephalograph.

392
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:32,472
That's 60-year-old technology
that killed patients.

393
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,767
Exactly. He'll compromise
on the C.T.

394
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,228
This isn't Cuddy.

395
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:38,345
Your Jedi mind tricks
won't work here.

396
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:41,431
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

397
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:43,850
You don't trust me.

398
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,268
Going behind your back

399
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:47,304
works better
when you're not facing us.

400
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:49,723
Instead of whatever lie
you're gonna tell Broda,

401
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:51,708
why don't you just tell him
the truth?

402
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:52,943
<i>If we are honest
and reasonable--</i>

403
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:54,311
people of all races
and creeds

404
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:55,779
will live together
in peace and harmony.

405
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,614
How did your first plan
work out?

406
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:01,768
Permission granted.

407
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,370
Thank you.

408
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,958
After she gets denied,
do the bait and switch.

409
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,295
They won't let your mommy
back in the hospital

410
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,015
because of an emergency
downstairs.

411
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:17,717
But we have to get
started.

412
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:20,153
I can't do it
without my Lamby.

413
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,089
Who is she?

414
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,308
I'm nobody.
I'm leaving soon.

415
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:28,011
Her name is Sam,
and she's a friend of mine.

416
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,982
What does Lamby usually do
while you get your treatment?

417
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,617
He holds my hand.

418
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:36,069
Well, you could hold
my hand.

419
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,673
That won't work.

420
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,641
<i>Well, sometimes
we have to do things</i>

421
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:43,527
that we don't want to do.

422
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:46,379
You have to go to school.
You have to eat your vegetables.

423
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:48,281
You have to take
your medicine.

424
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,417
You have to.

425
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:53,637
I want my mommy.

426
00:20:53,704 --> 00:20:55,005
Yeah.

427
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:57,040
I'll be right back.

428
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:05,599
You know, I'm
pretty sure Lamby has a cousin

429
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,851
down in the gift shop.

430
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:18,678
Hold off a minute.

431
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:19,863
I'm in overtime.

432
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:24,401
Oh!

433
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:26,453
Uh, Broda agreed
to C.T. the dad's brain.

434
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,905
Well, that sucks.

435
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:31,057
But I thought
that's what you wanted.

436
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,126
I shouldn't have
gotten it with the truth.

437
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:34,628
He's a hypocrite.

438
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:37,414
His position ever since
he's been here has been--

439
00:21:37,498 --> 00:21:39,199
<i>I-I pointed out
that either we're right,</i>

440
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:40,867
and he's the hero
for ending the crisis,

441
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:43,920
or he's right, and he gets to be
the first person

442
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:46,706
to look at a brain
infected with smallpox.

443
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:48,558
C.T. scans weren't around
30 years ago.

444
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:52,545
Good work.

445
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,895
So I guess honesty
is the best policy.

446
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:12,415
Why'd you say that?
Seriously...

447
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:15,118
To establish your viewpoint,
as if I didn't already know it,

448
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,253
or to demonstrate
some weird

449
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:19,906
cross-generational
female solidarity with Cuddy?

450
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:22,809
Actually, I was just trying
to fill the awkward silence.

451
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:25,378
Oh.

452
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:28,081
Why have they stopped?

453
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,052
You can't go out there.

454
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:33,136
Why did you stop?

455
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,420
Get out of the hallway.

456
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:36,089
He does not have
smallpox.

457
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:38,642
Yes, he does.

458
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:41,928
It itches.

459
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:43,279
He's just developed
pustules.

460
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:45,098
He's now too dangerous
to transport.

461
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:46,616
Get out of the hallway.

462
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,476
Dad's vitals are in the toilet.

463
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,445
He's got
full-blown smallpox.

464
00:22:58,473 --> 00:22:59,359
What about the daughter?

465
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:01,782
Pustule count is way up.
Vitals are way down.

466
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,250
Means I was wrong.

467
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,886
But to be precise, I was right
before I was wrong, so...

468
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:07,504
So we just give up
and go home?

469
00:23:08,894 --> 00:23:10,811
Actually, somebody
locked the front door,

470
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:13,147
but, yeah, we...
Give up.

471
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:15,800
<i>We might as well keep--
we have our diagnosis.</i>

472
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:17,635
If you're eager,
you can go find us a new case.

473
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:27,611
I guess she's eager
or has a blind spot for sarcasm.

474
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:32,016
I just want to look at the rash
under her arm

475
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:33,884
to see if it's matured--

476
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:36,103
<i>you can look through the glass.
I need to be closer.</i>

477
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:37,555
If the pustules
are at a different stage--

478
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:39,023
she's comfortable.

479
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:41,291
We're gonna have our results
back in eight hours.

480
00:23:41,343 --> 00:23:43,761
If it's not smallpox, you can be
the first one in there.

481
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,312
Why are you just standing
out there?

482
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:04,448
Uh...

483
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:06,167
I'm just trying
to help.

484
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:07,651
If you're feeling up to it,

485
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:09,987
can you sit up and show me
the rash under your arm?

486
00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:14,592
<i>Uh, wait.</i>

487
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,210
<i>The soles of your feet.</i>

488
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:19,146
<i>There aren't any lesions.
Who cares?</i>

489
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:21,215
They're everywhere else.
This is torture.

490
00:24:24,953 --> 00:24:26,887
Eve?

491
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:32,009
Guess who came by
the hospital for a visit?

492
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,979
Hello, Eve.

493
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:38,849
Oh, no!

494
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,684
All right.

495
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:43,287
<i>I'm gonna get a couple
of nice nurses to come in here</i>

496
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:45,706
and get you two ready
for the treatment, all right?

497
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,708
Okay.

498
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,000
How come Lamby can be here
but mommy can't?

499
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:05,226
Lamby was dirty.
Um, we gave her a bath.

500
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,894
This isn't Lamby!

501
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:16,821
Julie doesn't have
smallpox.

502
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:19,523
Did I just dream the part

503
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:22,092
where I finally agreed
it was smallpox?

504
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,195
<i>Well, if what I thought
was reality</i>

505
00:25:24,262 --> 00:25:26,997
was actually a dream,
then the reverse...

506
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:28,232
Oh, my God.

507
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:31,952
I had a threesome
with Beyonce and Lady Gaga.

508
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:34,572
She doesn't have pustules
on her palms

509
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,690
or the soles
of her feet.

510
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:40,611
The dad
does have pustules there.

511
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,631
So how does he get smallpox,
but it skips her?

512
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:56,810
If I leave like that,
you should follow.

513
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:58,095
Oh.

514
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:02,867
We gave it to him.

515
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,434
Where's Chase?

516
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,904
You do realize we don't
all live together, right?

517
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:08,939
Well, then just--
we gave it to him.

518
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,243
No pustules
on the daughter's palms, so...

519
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:13,777
<i>So therefore
your theory is</i>

520
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,379
you asked me to take
the dad's blood,

521
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:17,047
but I accidentally
injected him

522
00:26:17,115 --> 00:26:18,832
with smallpox.

523
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,834
Exactly, although technically,
it was the vaccinia virus,

524
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:23,620
<i>which is what the smallpox
vaccine is made from.</i>

525
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:25,455
<i>Same symptoms as smallpox,</i>

526
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,691
but only half the calories and
almost none of the lethality.

527
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,510
You sound like one
of those anti-vaccine cranks.

528
00:26:29,578 --> 00:26:30,895
You can't develop
full-blown symptoms

529
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:32,196
from the vaccine
this quickly.

530
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:35,132
You can if you're
immunocompromised.

531
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,017
Am I the only one
who reads these things?

532
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:39,770
Dad had kidney cancer.
Six years ago.

533
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:41,689
He's been in remission.
Well, it's obviously back.

534
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,473
Shot his immune system,

535
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,309
made him vulnerable
to the vaccinia,

536
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:47,144
which will get better
on interferon.

537
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:49,446
So if he responds
to the treatment,

538
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:51,448
that proves
he doesn't have smallpox.

539
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:52,833
Then what does
the daughter have?

540
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:55,452
Damn. I was hoping
you weren't gonna ask me that.

541
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,288
Can we please just focus

542
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:02,159
on the disease we just diagnosed
and can treat?

543
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,844
What's more likely--
he got smallpox

544
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,713
the day after
we immunized him for it,

545
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,664
or he's sick
from the vaccine itself?

546
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:09,767
You got any proof
the kidney cancer is back?

547
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,168
Well, let me give him this.

548
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,721
When he gets better,
that'll be the proof you need.

549
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:15,439
I'll put on one
of your fancy spacesuits,

550
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:17,191
and I promise I won't kiss him
on an open sore.

551
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:19,643
You know
who Janet Parker is?

552
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:21,845
In 1978,

553
00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:24,365
she was working
at a university in England.

554
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:27,484
Someone in a research lab
on the floor below screwed up.

555
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:31,355
Some smallpox virus managed
to float up through the vents

556
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:34,158
into the room
where she was working.

557
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:37,194
She died
four days later--

558
00:27:37,262 --> 00:27:39,229
<i>the last known person
to die from smallpox.</i>

559
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:41,548
And the person
in charge of the lab

560
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:45,252
was so destroyed,
he killed himself.

561
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:48,339
Now that he's shedding,

562
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,924
I can't open that door
for anyone.

563
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:55,062
Hey!

564
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:56,981
Look, there's
the proof you need.

565
00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:59,516
There's blood
in the urine bag.

566
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:00,934
His kidneys
are shutting down.

567
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,569
He's in the final stages
of the disease.

568
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:04,571
If smallpox was causing
the kidney failure,

569
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:05,906
the blood would be brown.

570
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:07,941
It's red because
the kidney cancer is back,

571
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:10,444
and this is not smallpox.

572
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:13,897
I'm not opening
that door.

573
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:20,170
Well, that makes one of us.

574
00:28:20,238 --> 00:28:21,622
Hey!

575
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:25,793
Hey!
You're insane!

576
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:26,910
But I'm right.

577
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:35,552
I hope you are,

578
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,422
<i>because I can't let you
out now.</i>

579
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:48,794
This is what happens

580
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:50,730
when you have no respect
for authority,

581
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:52,682
no respect
for anything.

582
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,567
You don't think
it's a little much

583
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:56,102
to use the threat of death

584
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:58,804
to win a totally separate
argument with your boyfriend?

585
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:01,674
You think this is
about the other thing?

586
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:04,427
Does seem to track
suspiciously closely.

587
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,046
I don't care right now
that you lied to me.

588
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:09,382
I want you to stay alive.

589
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:12,317
And if I do, does that mean
I win both arguments?

590
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:14,787
Put the suit on.

591
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,073
It's unnecessary, mom.

592
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,924
This is why I didn't want
them telling you.

593
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:20,593
It's why I'm glad
they didn't tell Wilson.

594
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:21,994
<i>Dr. House.</i>

595
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,889
I'm getting worse,
aren't I?

596
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:44,283
Interferon takes
a little time to work.

597
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:48,871
Don't worry.

598
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:56,662
Tell Broda

599
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,547
that I'm increasing
his oxygen.

600
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:01,200
And get my team down here.

601
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,817
Hi.

602
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,837
You're mad at us,
aren't you?

603
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,656
<i>Yeah.
Well, you have a right to be.</i>

604
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:25,941
We weren't honest.

605
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:27,726
You might not know
this yet,

606
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:30,830
but sometimes
adults mess up.

607
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,084
Can I tell you something,

608
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:38,737
and you keep it
just between us?

609
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:41,107
I'm not great with kids.

610
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,275
<i>I love them,
but I get scared</i>

611
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,127
that I'm gonna do
the wrong thing,

612
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:47,847
and then...
I usually do.

613
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:51,584
<i>And that's what I did
with the lying.</i>

614
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:55,104
And I'm very sorry
about that.

615
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:59,391
The reason why
I did the wrong thing

616
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,260
was because
I was trying to get you

617
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:04,429
to do the right thing.

618
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:07,283
Your mommy and your Lamby

619
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:11,120
both really need you
to get better.

620
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,972
<i>So...</i>

621
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,541
Do you think that...

622
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:19,111
You could be
really brave...

623
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,696
And do the right thing?

624
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,817
I'll try.

625
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:28,521
Great.

626
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:31,957
Great.

627
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:37,746
Fever's way up.
Sat's way down.

628
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,148
Pustules still spreading.

629
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:40,766
Interferon's not working.

630
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,801
Which means this is smallpox.

631
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:44,236
Right!

632
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:46,238
'Cause there are only
two diseases

633
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:48,724
in the whole wide world--
what else could it be?

634
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:50,176
<i>There's got to be something.</i>

635
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:52,244
No, there doesn't.

636
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:54,547
There are still no pustules
on her feet.

637
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:57,333
All the reasons you thought
it wasn't smallpox still exist.

638
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,685
<i>Forget her feet.
Forget all those other reasons.</i>

639
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,621
<i>Look at him now.
The pox are dome-shaped.</i>

640
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:05,374
<i>They're on 80% of his body,
and they're not scabbing over.</i>

641
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:08,627
This is textbook smallpox.

642
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:11,297
Ddx'ing at this point
isn't gonna make a difference.

643
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:13,716
Don't say that.
I'm sorry.

644
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:18,087
House...

645
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:20,189
You screwed up
going in there.

646
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,989
You have any fever?

647
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,208
Not yet.

648
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,293
But when it does come,

649
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,245
I assume you'll see
the pettiness

650
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,581
of being mad at me
for lying.

651
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:47,750
Shut up, House.

652
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:56,008
I'll be right back.

653
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:05,868
I'm not gonna make it,
am I?

654
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,598
You should say good-bye
to your family.

655
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:54,149
I love you.

656
00:33:54,217 --> 00:33:56,151
Just hold on.

657
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:57,620
Fight this.

658
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,557
You got to take care
of my boy.

659
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:06,629
No.

660
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,014
Promise me.

661
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:13,168
I promise.

662
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:20,175
I love you.

663
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,194
I love you too.

664
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:25,848
Get Roger closer.

665
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:28,567
Come closer.

666
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,635
<i>Come on.</i>

667
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:34,806
Dad.

668
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:39,111
My baby boy.

669
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:43,115
Dad, please...

670
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,701
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

671
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:48,370
Lulu's gonna
take care of you.

672
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:49,738
I don't want her, dad.

673
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:51,290
She's not you.

674
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:59,698
I will always
love you, Roger.

675
00:35:04,404 --> 00:35:05,454
Dad?

676
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:18,577
You're killing me!

677
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:19,873
<i>The suit will protect you</i>

678
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:22,759
if you haven't already
been exposed.

679
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:24,962
My air supply's
almost out.

680
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:26,446
We'll give you
another canister.

681
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:28,565
Yeah, and when I change it,
I will be exposed.

682
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:29,800
Just move him!

683
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:31,351
I wish I could.

684
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:32,919
<i>Oh, that's great,</i>

685
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:34,721
'cause you know
what you can do?

686
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:36,306
You can move me.

687
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:38,475
You don't know
that I have smallpox yet.

688
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,943
We have to assume.

689
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:42,279
There's another isolation room
on the fifth floor.

690
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:44,665
The problem is getting him
from here to there.

691
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:45,983
So it's inconvenient.

692
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:47,767
My having
a fighting chance at life

693
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:49,269
is inconvenient!

694
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:52,772
I'm sorry.

695
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,330
We don't know
that he'll catch it.

696
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:02,466
We don't know that
it's definitely smallpox,

697
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,951
not until we get the DNA results
back from the CDC.

698
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:06,887
What do you think
the dad just died of?

699
00:37:06,955 --> 00:37:08,972
Would it kill us
to talk it through?

700
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,124
Kill us? No.
Save House? Also no.

701
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,626
<i>Even if by some miracle</i>

702
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,627
it's not smallpox,
there's nothing more

703
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,463
for us to go on.
There's no new data.

704
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:17,931
And there isn't going
to be any--

705
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:20,133
where are you going?
To get more data.

706
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:25,605
"Gerritt seems distant

707
00:37:25,673 --> 00:37:27,074
and preoccupied."

708
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:28,925
Who's Gerritt?
Is he a slave?

709
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:30,844
Gerritt is the Captain's kitty.

710
00:37:30,912 --> 00:37:32,612
The Captain's cat
is preoccupied?

711
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:34,364
Skip the cat.

712
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:36,566
<i>Uh, "one goat
slaughtered for dinner.</i>

713
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:38,735
Broke out the next barrel
of wine."

714
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,287
Skip the food.

715
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,655
Uh, c-can we go back
to the cat?

716
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:44,508
Did the cat get sick?

717
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:46,660
<i>Smallpox
is exclusive to humans.</i>

718
00:37:46,728 --> 00:37:48,495
Ship captains
didn't have pets.

719
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:50,013
Nothing and nobody
went on those ships

720
00:37:50,098 --> 00:37:51,765
if it didn't have
a purpose.

721
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,000
Hunting mice and rats?
For the crew.

722
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:56,336
The hold was probably
infested with mice.

723
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:58,055
What if that's
the difference?

724
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:01,608
What happened to Gerritt?

725
00:38:01,676 --> 00:38:02,843
Ah.

726
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,779
Is that a sad "ah"
or a cute "ah"?

727
00:38:05,847 --> 00:38:08,382
Gerritt, he died.
It's a sad "ah."

728
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:14,187
Before he died,
did he lose his fur?

729
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,025
How did you know?

730
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:20,977
Mice don't carry smallpox,

731
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:23,046
but they do carry
rickettsialpox.

732
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:24,881
Which is treatable.

733
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,803
Just start them
on doxycycline.

734
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,055
Based on a bald cat?
You never heard of shedding?

735
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,473
What's the downside?

736
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,926
If we shove her full of
antibiotics plus the antivirals,

737
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,310
it'll suppress
her bone marrow.

738
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:38,678
That girl's
about to die.

739
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,230
She probably is,

740
00:38:40,314 --> 00:38:42,899
and I don't want to risk
pushing her over the edge.

741
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:44,484
At least look
at the dad's body.

742
00:38:44,552 --> 00:38:47,738
Small patches of black, dead
tissue will prove I'm right.

743
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:50,690
Eschars appear
with rickettsialpox

744
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:52,325
but not with smallpox.

745
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:54,727
If he had developed eschars,
I would have noticed.

746
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,997
You haven't been within 20 feet
of the guy in hours.

747
00:38:57,064 --> 00:38:59,032
Have them check.

748
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,283
<i>Their job
is to bleach the body,</i>

749
00:39:00,368 --> 00:39:01,785
kill the virus,

750
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:03,370
and get it out of there
for Dr. House's sake.

751
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:05,038
<i>Bleaching the body</i>

752
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:08,125
will destroy all evidence
of rickettsialpox.

753
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:10,177
There is no evidence!

754
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:12,095
I'm not trying to hurt
anyone here.

755
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,097
I'm not lying to you.

756
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:16,216
This is smallpox.

757
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:29,362
House, you have
to examine the body.

758
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,264
I'm not going
anywhere near it.

759
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:33,266
Look for eschars.
Hurry.

760
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:35,769
You think it's r-pox?

761
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:37,187
The Captain had a cat.

762
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:38,771
He lost his fur
and then died.

763
00:39:48,749 --> 00:39:51,134
Step back, Dr. House.

764
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:02,479
It's kind of hard to do
an autopsy in oven mitts.

765
00:40:02,563 --> 00:40:03,763
Take them off.

766
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:05,232
Says the woman

767
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:07,067
standing behind
two panes of glass.

768
00:40:07,134 --> 00:40:08,301
<i>Do you believe me?</i>

769
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:09,820
Forget me.
Do you believe you?

770
00:40:09,904 --> 00:40:12,589
You think it's rickettsialpox,
don't you?

771
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:14,074
<i>If it is, it's curable,</i>

772
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:15,826
and she's gonna die
unless we can prove it.

773
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,666
You really are annoying.

774
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:40,300
Come on, House.
Come on.

775
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:50,510
Eschar.

776
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,233
Eschars.

777
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:08,861
Start the girl
on doxycycline right now.

778
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:28,682
Mommy!

779
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:34,237
You were good with her.

780
00:41:34,322 --> 00:41:35,888
Yeah, only after
being bad.

781
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,158
It takes practice.

782
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:40,944
Maybe I should get
a puppy.

783
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:44,331
Yeah, or...
Pregnant?

784
00:41:52,373 --> 00:41:54,407
Hey.

785
00:41:57,378 --> 00:41:59,246
You're gonna be okay.

786
00:42:04,986 --> 00:42:05,919
Hey.

787
00:42:05,987 --> 00:42:07,420
Hey.

788
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:24,821
Buy you breakfast?
No, thanks.

789
00:42:24,905 --> 00:42:26,656
You can pay...

790
00:42:26,741 --> 00:42:28,941
If it's starting to feel
like I'm carrying you.

791
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:30,961
House, stop.

792
00:42:34,415 --> 00:42:37,000
When I was dying...

793
00:42:37,084 --> 00:42:40,287
You realized that a little
white lie between coworkers

794
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:42,172
wasn't such a big deal.

795
00:42:42,256 --> 00:42:44,957
Yeah, and that
was true...

796
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:46,893
When you were dying.

9999
