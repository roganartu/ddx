1
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:18,254
Hike!

2
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,276
<i>Hey.</i>

3
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,397
Hey.

4
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:54,117
So, uh, what
did you want?

5
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,037
It's too late now.

6
00:00:58,104 --> 00:00:59,038
Too late
for what?

7
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:00,072
I'll tell
you later.

8
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:01,657
Come on,
the bell just rang.

9
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:02,792
We still got time.

10
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,713
I'm ready.

11
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:10,783
Uh, you sure?

12
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:14,188
Yeah.

13
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:16,556
Why now,
all of a sudden?

14
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:18,057
What, you don't want to
anymore?

15
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:19,592
Yeah, I do.

16
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:21,961
I'm just wondering
what changed your mind.

17
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:23,930
You did.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,487
Now?

19
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:32,939
If you want.

20
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:40,813
<i>Excuse me.</i>

21
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,481
You two need
to come with me.

22
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:51,657
- Take a seat.
- But we didn't--

23
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,376
<i>You know you're not</i>
<i>supposed to be back there.</i>

24
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,627
We weren't doing anything.

25
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:57,013
That's not what
it looked like to me.

26
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:58,381
<i>Principal Fields</i>
<i>will be back</i>

27
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:00,216
as soon
as the assembly is over.

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,185
Ms. Washburn, please, if I get
one more referral, my mom--

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,805
Bench.

30
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:16,649
Who put sand
in her vagina?

Hey, kids.

34
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:09,341
How you boys doing?

35
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:11,844
Uh, can we help you?

36
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:14,680
I certainly hope so.

37
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:16,632
You know
what this is?

38
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,667
A laptop?

39
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:22,104
Password-protected laptop

40
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:24,172
that I need you
nerds to hack into.

41
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:26,108
No insecticides
or toxic cleaners.

42
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:27,809
Check the bathroom.

43
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:28,760
Who are you?

44
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:30,479
Your roommate's doctor.

45
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,447
You remember
your roommate, don't you?

46
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:35,250
I thought he
just had bronchitis.

47
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:36,768
That's what the morons

48
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,737
at the Rutgers Student
Medical Center thought,

49
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:41,657
which may be part of the reason
he just coughed up a lung.

50
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,376
What do you mean,
he coughed up a lung?

51
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,795
He coughed...

52
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,630
After which
the respiratory organ

53
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:52,534
which resided in his chest
resided in his mouth...

54
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:54,336
Actually, his hand.

55
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:56,505
Well, his mouth,
then his hand.

56
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:58,473
Bathroom's clean.

57
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,310
- What's in this?
- Just soda.

58
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:04,096
- Mind if I have some?
- You want my drink?

59
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:06,331
You got a problem
with that?

60
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,716
Uh, yeah.

61
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,050
<i>Actually, I do.</i>

62
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:10,719
<i>You barge</i>
<i>into our room,</i>

63
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,237
<i>start looking through</i>
<i>our personal, private stuff,</i>

64
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:13,939
demand I hack
into a computer

65
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,741
I think I can safely assume
doesn't belong--

66
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,662
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I break your concentration?

67
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,831
<i>Please continue.</i>

68
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:26,168
You were talking
about personal privacy.

69
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,255
What, you're finished?

70
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,841
Well, allow me to retort.

71
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:34,192
<i>Wait a second.</i>

72
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,128
<i>You're saying</i>
<i>this actually happened?</i>

73
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,213
Absolutely.

74
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:41,516
<i>You're lying.</i>

75
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:43,969
Interesting theory.
Can you prove it?

76
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:46,188
Doctors don't carry guns.

77
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:47,856
They don't shoot people,

78
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:50,592
and they definitely
don't search patients' homes.

79
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,394
Plus, I've seen
<i>Pulp Fiction--</i>

80
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:54,162
the movie
you're totally ripping off.

81
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:58,767
Huh.

82
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,519
Wait, uh, was
it Timmy Morgan?

83
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,771
I have no idea.
It had to be him.

84
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:07,075
He's, like, totally obsessed
with old movies.

85
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:09,778
<i>Pulp Fiction</i> is not
an old mov--what?

86
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,163
So you're here to talk

87
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:13,165
to the principal
about something Timmy did?

88
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:14,666
I got no problem with Timmy.

89
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:18,003
And even if I did,
I ain't no snitch.

90
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:20,005
Then why
are you here?

91
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:21,640
To dig myself
out of a hole.

92
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:24,643
Instead I dug
a bigger one.

93
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,578
What'd you do?

94
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:27,629
What'd you do?

95
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,899
What'd you do?

96
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:33,702
What happened
to your eye?

97
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,021
It's none
of your business.

98
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:39,107
Actually, it's none of yours.
I'm a doctor.

99
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:40,442
It's a few days old,

100
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:42,761
so that's not
why you're here,

101
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:45,631
unless you two got busted
for some sort of revenge plot.

102
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:48,617
But then you'd look angry
instead of...ashamed.

103
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:50,002
I'm not ashamed.

104
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:51,370
<i>Interesting.</i>

105
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:53,789
You defensively insist
that you're not ashamed,

106
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,340
which, of course,
means you <i>are</i> ashamed.

107
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,459
<i>And yet,</i>
<i>you're the victim.</i>

108
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,795
You want to know
how she got the black eye?

109
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:02,364
Tell us why
you're here first.

110
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:03,915
Anyone ever tell you
you're annoying?

111
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:04,966
No.

112
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:06,885
Yes, all the time.

113
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,186
But he's right.

114
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,689
You want to know?
You first.

115
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:15,894
I didn't kill anybody.

116
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:18,613
<i>I have to be here,</i>
<i>so I figured</i>

117
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,932
I'd punch up the stakes
in the first act.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,984
But we did,
and almost always do,

119
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:24,770
search the patient's home.

120
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:26,304
And if we
tell them first,

121
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:28,874
<i>then they can hide something</i>
<i>that we need to know</i>

122
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,293
in order to figure out
what's wrong with them.

123
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,512
Why would they hide something
that could be killing them?

124
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,347
Because they are morons.

125
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,699
<i>They're all morons,</i>
<i>and everybody lies.</i>

126
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,834
<i>Wait, if everybody lies,</i>

127
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:41,303
then that means
you're lying right now.

128
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,475
I didn't say everybody
always lies...Aristotle.

129
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:50,378
And on that note, unless
there are any questions...

130
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,513
Good.

131
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:53,265
Oh, Dr. Hourani...

132
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:56,384
<i>Before you finish,</i>

133
00:06:56,436 --> 00:06:58,720
maybe you could describe
what you actually do.

134
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:03,091
<i>You know, like if someone comes</i>
<i>in for a routine physical?</i>

135
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,248
You want routine?

136
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,200
<i>Please.</i>

137
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:15,620
It just feels
kind of, like, numb.

138
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:18,790
You do a lot
of bicycle riding?

139
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,093
No.

140
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:22,911
How long have
you been married?

141
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:25,079
It's 12 years
next month.

142
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,349
You have six kids.

143
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,184
Mm-hmm.

144
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:30,719
Well, you don't think
it could have

145
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,053
anything to do
with that, do you?

146
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:34,756
Probably.

147
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:36,808
How often do you use
your vibrator?

148
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:39,444
Excuse me?

149
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:41,930
Your battery-operated
Brad Pitt.

150
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:44,032
<i>After giving</i>
<i>the gift of life</i>

151
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,600
to six eight-pound,
four-ounce wrecking balls,

152
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:49,237
I think I can safely assume it's
an industrial-strength model?

153
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:51,573
Dr. Hourani, please.

154
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:55,577
You wanted routine.

155
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,295
Am I done?

156
00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:59,181
Maybe we should
just move on.

157
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,782
No problem.

158
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,100
<i>I meant with your typical day.</i>

159
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:04,219
<i>I assume you see</i>
<i>more than one patient?</i>

160
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:06,421
Nope.

161
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:09,841
Okay.

162
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:13,395
Then I guess we will move on
to our next guest.

163
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:15,463
Wait, if you
only see one patient,

164
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:16,982
what do you do
the rest of the day?

165
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:26,658
Dr. Hourani?

166
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:37,118
Just in time
for lunch.

167
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,987
By lunch, you mean a conference
call with the board,

168
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,041
and by just in time,
you mean, 20 minutes late.

169
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,594
I meant sex...

170
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:47,328
By lunch.

171
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,099
How about we start
with a small tossed salad?

172
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,186
As of this morning,
I'm on a diet.

173
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:05,697
Meaning?

174
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:08,033
I told you,
I'm busy.

175
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:09,401
<i>No, you told me</i>
<i>you were supposed to be busy</i>

176
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:10,819
20 minutes ago.

177
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,520
But you were obviously able
to put them off then,

178
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,155
there's no reason you
can't put them off now.

179
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:16,024
How about,
"I wanted to then,

180
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:19,377
and now I don't"?

181
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,162
Get your finger
off my phone.

182
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:23,465
We obviously have
something we need to discuss.

183
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:25,250
Now is not
a good time.

184
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:26,668
If you're mad
because you don't feel

185
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,503
you're getting the necessary
amount of affection,

186
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,338
all you have to do
is ask.

187
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,540
Seriously,
not now.

188
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:34,643
If memory serves, I enjoyed
a healthy Sunday brunch.

189
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,544
So your insinuation--

190
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:37,646
Ow!

191
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:39,547
- What is your problem?
- You!

192
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,483
You are my problem.

193
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,603
You are the most selfish,
self-centered son of a bitch

194
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,071
on the face
of the planet.

195
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:48,556
And I'm sick of it.

196
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:52,226
I'm just...done.

197
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:55,730
<i>I can't deal</i>
<i>with you anymore.</i>

198
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:07,909
So that's what a typical doctor
does on a typical day.

199
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:09,911
Any questions?

200
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:17,636
What's a vibrator?

201
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:27,596
Why was
your girlfriend so mad?

202
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,507
It doesn't matter.

203
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:31,926
Well, obviously
it matters.

204
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,528
I mean, if she's
your girlfriend,

205
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:35,763
you should care
how she feels.

206
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:38,099
I mean, it doesn't matter
to the story.

207
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,518
It's the most important part
of the story.

208
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:43,237
It's the only thing
that does matter.

209
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:45,973
You don't kiss her enough--
is that the problem?

210
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,608
Absolutely not.

211
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,744
Which, by your definition,
means it is.

212
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,865
We kiss plenty.

213
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:55,950
Your turn.

214
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,168
Then what's the problem?

215
00:10:57,252 --> 00:10:58,419
Your turn.

216
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:01,756
What's the problem?

217
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:03,174
Excuse me.

218
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,727
<i>When exactly</i>
<i>will the commandant be back?</i>

219
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,828
Shouldn't be
much longer, sir.

220
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,520
Well?

221
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,007
Oh, so now
you're not gonna talk.

222
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,860
<i>That's real mature.</i>

223
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,397
<i>All right, fine.</i>

224
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:28,900
We got busted for kissing
behind the school.

225
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:30,851
Now you know
why we're here.

226
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,904
So tell us
why you're here.

227
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:34,539
The deal was
about the black eye.

228
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,791
And we didn't kiss.

229
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:40,128
So you were just making
him beg, huh?

230
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:41,629
<i>I didn't have you pegged</i>
<i>as a tease.</i>

231
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:42,964
I'm not a tease.

232
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,033
The available evidence
suggests otherwise.

233
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,367
I'm not a tease.

234
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:47,585
Prove it...

235
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:54,142
By--by telling me
your story.

236
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:01,566
You're
a pathetic loser, jerk!

237
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,735
And I wouldn't kiss you
if I had brain cancer

238
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:06,354
and your lips
were the cure!

239
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:12,226
She actually
said that?

240
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:14,829
- Well, yeah, that was, like, two days ago.
- It doesn't matter.

241
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:17,665
I clearly didn't lead him along
or anything like that,

242
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,234
which proves
I'm not a tease.

243
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:22,320
So why is your girlfriend
mad at you?

244
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:25,072
I'm getting
a kind of bossy vibe.

245
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,457
I take it
you're into that.

246
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,426
Don't answer!

247
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,061
Your turn.

248
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:36,226
What seems to be
the problem, sir?

249
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,778
I'm having
more difficulty breathing

250
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:39,496
and some pain in my chest.

251
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:41,114
You're new,
aren't you?

252
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:44,284
Uh, yeah, I just moved
from Chicago.

253
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,003
Chicago's awesome.
What part are you from?

254
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:50,090
We need to get
a chest C.T.

255
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:51,375
Excuse me,
I'm the senior team member,

256
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:52,793
which means
we don't need anything

257
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:54,795
unless I say we need it.

258
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,965
- Do you want to have an affair?
- You want to have a threesome?

259
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,917
You can't talk to her like that.
I'm telling Cuddy.

260
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:03,220
We need a chest C.T.

261
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:05,055
Get it yourself.

262
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:07,441
Isn't that, like,
sexual harassment?

263
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:08,976
Not if you're
good-looking.

264
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,262
Excuse me?

265
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,064
You said the one guy was short
with a big nose.

266
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:16,283
Guess that's not
the only thing that's big.

267
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,451
What does that mean?

268
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,820
It means he's lying...
again.

269
00:13:19,904 --> 00:13:23,490
Because you can't handle
the truth!

270
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,587
<i>That's so easy.</i>

271
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:30,021
<i>A Few Good Men.</i>

272
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:32,023
Okay, I give up.

273
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:34,042
<i>I think we should move on</i>

274
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:35,744
to our next guest.

275
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:38,463
<i>Mr. Dryden...</i>

276
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:42,801
<i>Uh, works for one of the</i>
<i>largest advertising agencies</i>

277
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,719
in New York City.
Boring! Boring!

278
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,704
Can we at least hear
what happened to the patient?

279
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,430
If Dr. Hourani
promises to--

280
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:56,815
Patient's dead.

281
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:02,404
Floor is yours, Don.

282
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:04,439
Dave.

283
00:14:04,523 --> 00:14:05,807
<i>He's not dead.</i>

284
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,409
You said earlier
he was still in the hospital.

285
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:09,494
- What's wrong with him?
- He's got a cough.

286
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:10,996
You said
he coughed up a lung.

287
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,064
- What about the laptop?
- Who cares about the laptop?

288
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:15,667
Yeah, and he already said he
was lying about that, you moron.

289
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,002
<i>Gabe...</i>

290
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:18,753
- We do not use that word here.
- He did.

291
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,288
Yeah, and I was talking
about people like you.

292
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:23,241
Ooh.

293
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,160
Dr. Hourani, please,

294
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:29,080
could you just finish,
quickly, so we can move on?

295
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,807
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what's wrong.</i>

296
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:41,693
He was stable for a while, and
then all of a sudden, he just--

297
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,811
<i>Bronchial infection must be</i>

298
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:44,762
from a drug-resistant
strain.

299
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:46,564
O-2 sats
are plummeting.

300
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:48,817
We need to get him
on a bronchodilator

301
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,785
before he goes into respiratory arrest.
Suction, sit him up.

302
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,288
Start blow by oxygen.

303
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:03,999
What is that?

304
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,801
I think it's his...

305
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:09,337
It's his lung.

306
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:18,096
That actually happened?

307
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:20,065
<i>Yes, it really happened.</i>

308
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:24,635
I take cases that other doctors
fail to diagnose,

309
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,855
which is why I only
take one at a time.

310
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,907
My current patient
is a college student.

311
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:30,592
He's actually
in the hospital right now.

312
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,612
<i>And, yes, he really</i>
<i>did cough up a large portion</i>

313
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,414
of dead lung tissue.

314
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:39,117
How's that
even possible?

315
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:42,454
That's what
she said.

316
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:45,173
No, she did
literally say that.

317
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:47,425
How's that
even possible?

318
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,177
Primary squamous carcinoma
could cause

319
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:50,745
lung tissue
to basically disintegrate.

320
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:52,430
It's not cancer.
F.O.B. was normal.

321
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:53,782
<i>It's not an infection either.</i>

322
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,684
Broad-spectrum antibiotics
haven't had any effect.

323
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,469
Who password-protects
a computer

324
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,388
they keep in a locked desk
in a locked office?

325
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:01,856
Someone who works with someone
who thinks it's okay

326
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:03,641
<i>to break</i>
<i>into other people's homes?</i>

327
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:06,061
<i>An amebic liver abscess</i>
<i>could rupture</i>

328
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:08,029
through the diaphragm
into the thorax.

329
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,732
Not when his liver-function
tests are all normal.

330
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:13,201
His dorm mates are
computer science majors.

331
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:15,453
<i>If they're fabricating chips,</i>
<i>they could be working</i>

332
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,455
with all kinds
of different toxic solvents.

333
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,492
We need to search
the dorm.

334
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:22,327
"We"?

335
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:24,629
<i>Oui.</i>
<i>Allons-y.</i>

336
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:26,247
While we're out,

337
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,832
do a thorascopic lung biopsy

338
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:29,250
<i>and a c-ANCA,</i>

339
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:31,369
because
it's sarcoidosis.

340
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,422
But if you think it's
sarcoidosis, why are you...

341
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:37,175
So you really did force
his roommate

342
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:38,543
to hack into the laptop?

343
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:40,628
Why would I lie?

344
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:42,347
But whose
laptop is it?

345
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:43,681
It's your girlfriend's,
isn't it?

346
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,716
She's not my girlfriend.

347
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:47,885
I'm just interested in her
because she's a client,

348
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,887
and she sleeps
above her covers--

349
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:52,207
four feet
above her covers.

350
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:53,742
What?

351
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,527
<i>Ghostbusters.</i>

352
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:57,395
So that's
why she's so mad--

353
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,030
you looked through
her computer?

354
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,883
No, that part happened
after she got mad.

355
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,418
<i>First she got mad.</i>

356
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:06,538
Then I stole her computer
to fix things.

357
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,757
<i>And then</i>
<i>we got the case.</i>

358
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,409
Wait, so you tried to fix
your relationship

359
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,044
by stealing
her computer?

360
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:16,464
Well, when you
say it like that...

361
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,516
Yes.

362
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,386
Looks like
you're the moron.

363
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:25,056
Ooh!

364
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:53,227
I can also get three sets
of golf clubs in there.

365
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,144
No way.

366
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,196
<i>You didn't get</i>
<i>her laptop</i>

367
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:14,332
<i>by blowing down</i>
<i>the door of her office.</i>

368
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,150
That's from
<i>Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.</i>

369
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:20,456
Just seeing if you're
still paying attention.

370
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:22,924
It was actually
more subtle.

371
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:30,481
<i>The Thomas Crown Affair--</i>

372
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:32,517
the Steve McQueen version.

373
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:35,236
Just tell us the truth already.
<i>Excuse me.</i>

374
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:37,522
But there are others here who
would like a chance to speak.

375
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:39,440
Go right ahead.

376
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,392
No!

377
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:46,247
Audience is
always right.

378
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:51,402
Luke.

379
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:53,738
It wasn't me.

380
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,208
Ma'am,
are you okay?

381
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,909
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

382
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:02,430
Ooh, what's
that smell?

383
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:03,681
Ugh.

384
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:09,587
Smells like a gas leak.

385
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:11,189
<i>Call Dr. Cuddy.</i>

386
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:20,648
<i>You poisoned</i>
<i>a room full of patients</i>

387
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:23,034
so you could steal
your girlfriend's laptop?

388
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,286
I didn't poison anybody.

389
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:29,490
I spilled some hydrogen sulfide
and ammonia on the floor,

390
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:32,126
thinking the stench
would clear the place out.

391
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,245
But instead of breathing
through his nose,

392
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:36,798
some idiot
decided to hold his breath.

393
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:39,050
He passes out,
and before I know it,

394
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:44,722
the place is a perfect storm
of mass hysteria...

395
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,641
Although it worked out
just as well.

396
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,092
<i>They're morons.</i>

397
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,827
Agreed.

398
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:52,146
No, not the patients,
the kids.

399
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:53,798
It doesn't matter
how you stole it.

400
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:55,600
What matters is why.

401
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:59,153
You know, you're starting
to remind me of someone.

402
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:02,023
I didn't ask how you stole it.
I asked why.

403
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:04,642
Isn't it obvious?

404
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:06,143
You think you can tell
why she's mad

405
00:20:06,195 --> 00:20:07,412
by reading
budget spreadsheets

406
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,580
and per diem schedules?

407
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:11,115
I know why she's mad.

408
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,950
What I need to know is
how to make her un-mad.

409
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,786
And step one
is gaining access

410
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:16,287
to the journal
on her laptop,

411
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:18,989
where she records
her innermost thoughts...

412
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,375
Instead of just
watching porn with me.

413
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:24,429
Oh, grow up.

414
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:27,932
If porn was bad, why would
there be so many nuns in it?

415
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,134
Why is she mad?

416
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,302
<i>I was myself,</i>

417
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:32,854
which, by the way,

418
00:20:32,938 --> 00:20:35,506
she's supposed
to love unconditionally.

419
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:37,508
I didn't do anything.

420
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,527
<i>We had a great weekend.</i>

421
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:43,231
Went to a Blues club,
we watched <i>Cinderfella</i> on DVD.

422
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:44,315
And?

423
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:46,350
It doesn't matter.

424
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:48,736
<i>She's being unreasonable,</i>
<i>and I have to fix it.</i>

425
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,204
I need to know what's
really important to her.

426
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,657
- I need something big.
- Because?

427
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,409
We're past that.

428
00:20:57,663 --> 00:21:01,215
Have you tried
childhood pet names?

429
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,633
I don't know her pets.

430
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:04,051
She's never mentioned
a pet?

431
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,005
Well, yeah,
but I wasn't listening.

432
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:11,259
She's not mad because I don't
remember a dead dog's name.

433
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:14,595
Her first dog
was Ronaldo.

434
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,398
Is that R-o
or R-e-y?

435
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:20,101
I didn't ask. Try both.

436
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:21,719
Just got a case
from the E.R.

437
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,070
Rutgers student came in

438
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:24,772
with what looked like
acute bronchitis.

439
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:26,741
But there's nothing in
his blood or sputum cultures.

440
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:28,326
Don't you think
it's time you people

441
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:30,278
stop looking to the white man
to solve all your problems?

442
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:31,729
His O-2 sats
are in the toilet.

443
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,230
If we don't figure out
what's attacking his--

444
00:21:33,282 --> 00:21:34,582
So figure it out!

445
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,484
I'm busy.

446
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:41,923
That can't be true.

447
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,858
Why not?

448
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:48,613
'Cause if he was dying--
I mean, you're a doctor.

449
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:54,268
Patients die every day.

450
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:57,104
Not all of them
are interesting.

451
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:11,277
You still haven't answered
either question.

452
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:15,687
She was mad because she's
genetically programmed

453
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:17,989
to make a big deal
out of every little thing.

454
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:21,109
So she's mad
'cause she's a girl.

455
00:22:21,781 --> 00:22:24,049
And now she's mad
because she's programmed

456
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,878
to make a big deal
out of every little thing.

457
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:30,037
Actually, she's not like that.
<i>Why are you sticking up for her?</i>-

458
00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:32,398
She says you're a pathetic jerk
and she hates you.

459
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:34,150
That was
a long time ago.

460
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:35,518
It was
two days ago.

461
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:37,403
And it wasn't
even true then.

462
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:40,123
- How do you know?
- Because I know how you think.

463
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,041
Really?

464
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:43,493
Really.

465
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,345
Really?

466
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:02,645
Hey.

467
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:05,314
Uh, and no peck
on the cheek.

468
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:08,935
It has to be
on the lips.

469
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:11,771
Winning a bet
to force her to kiss you

470
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:13,339
actually cuts
against your theory

471
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:14,657
that you know
how she thinks.

472
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:16,192
I wasn't forcing her
to do anything

473
00:23:16,243 --> 00:23:18,244
that she
didn't want to do.

474
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:20,947
You're hoping for a career
in the NBA or the NFL?

475
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:22,698
The bet let her do
what she wanted to do

476
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:24,617
while still being able to act
like she didn't,

477
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:26,002
<i>so her friends</i>
<i>wouldn't get all, like,</i>

478
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:27,920
<i>calling her a slut</i>
<i>or something.</i>

479
00:23:27,988 --> 00:23:30,573
Not that it's slutty
or anything.

480
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:33,092
It's just a kiss.

481
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:36,846
Not even close to true.

482
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:42,418
I just couldn't believe
I'd lose.

483
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:43,603
Ah, now we're getting
somewhere.

484
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:47,256
No, we're not.

485
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:49,258
Oh, I thought we were.

486
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:50,526
No, you thought
we weren't,

487
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:52,028
and that's exactly
what you want,

488
00:23:52,095 --> 00:23:55,531
because you don't want to
tell us why was she mad at you!

489
00:23:58,485 --> 00:23:59,785
You tell us you don't
want to do your job

490
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,337
because you're too busy
trying to break

491
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:03,272
into your girlfriend's laptop
to figure out a way

492
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:04,457
<i>to make her</i>
<i>not mad at you.</i>

493
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,774
<i>But you don't tell us</i>

494
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:08,244
why she <i>was</i> mad at you.

495
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:12,965
It's stupid.

496
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:15,801
Talk.

497
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:25,978
I'm out of here.

498
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:28,848
Unless...

499
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:33,402
Rachel's gonna be up soon.

500
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,821
Well, you never know.

501
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:39,025
Yes, I do.

502
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:43,137
Can you take the garbage out
before you go?

503
00:24:43,197 --> 00:24:46,165
Uh, I-I-I would,
but...

504
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,668
Oh, come on.

505
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:50,336
It's not a lot.

506
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,923
Pain's always worst
first thing in the morning.

507
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:10,006
<i>Mommy!</i>

508
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,962
You used her toothbrush?

509
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:34,547
That's so gross.

510
00:25:34,631 --> 00:25:37,166
What's the big deal?

511
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:38,551
It's not like
she had a problem

512
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:40,169
swapping spit
the night before.

513
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,221
Well, maybe it's not
the swapping spit

514
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:45,174
that bothers her, but the fact
that you don't listen to her.

515
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:46,676
<i>Had she warned</i>
<i>you not to do it?</i>

516
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:48,010
Oh, I listen to her.

517
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:49,595
But you just said before
that you didn't.

518
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:50,980
No, I said I didn't remember
what she said.

519
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:52,715
No, you said you
don't listen--

520
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:55,735
I listen to her.

521
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:56,852
Okay?

522
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,070
Believe me, I listen.

523
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:02,275
<i>It's my toothbrush,</i>

524
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,827
<i>and it's not just once.</i>

525
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:07,079
And it's not
like I'd even care,

526
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:11,667
but you totally
destroy it.

527
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:13,419
You're supposed
to brush with it,

528
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:15,371
not gnaw on it
like a rawhide bone.

529
00:26:15,422 --> 00:26:18,874
I think
Miss Four Cavities' time

530
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:21,294
would be better spent copying
Mr. No Cavities

531
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:23,796
instead of
complaining about him.

532
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,965
And given what
I'd just been doing,

533
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,667
I thought you wouldn't want me
going out to dinner

534
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:30,336
without a good brush
and a floss.

535
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:33,489
Would you please just use
the toothbrush I bought you?

536
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:37,126
Would you please just shut up
and watch the movie?

537
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,283
I said, "please."

538
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,369
Why would you have
to brush your teeth

539
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:48,437
before you go to dinner?

540
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:50,039
You don't want
to know...

541
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:51,240
Yet.

542
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:52,825
You're gross
and dumb.

543
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:54,744
<i>You listen</i>
<i>to what she says</i>

544
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:57,046
just so you can tell her
how wrong she is.

545
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:58,964
You are clueless
and naive.

546
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,384
<i>I have to tell her</i>
<i>that she's wrong,</i>

547
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:03,252
'cause no one else will.

548
00:27:03,303 --> 00:27:05,388
She's the boss,

549
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:07,306
which means
she's surrounded by morons

550
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:09,008
who are either afraid of her,

551
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:10,426
or they want
to kiss up to her,

552
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:13,128
or they want to...

553
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,514
Kiss her.

554
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,650
But not you.
<i>I already kissed her.</i>

555
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:19,352
And I respect her enough
not to treat her

556
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:22,638
like some tender blossom
who needs to be coddled.

557
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:25,858
Makes sense to me.

558
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:30,196
That's what you
think you did?

559
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,331
Yeah, totally.

560
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:39,055
You mean...

561
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:40,556
Wha--

562
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:41,640
you?

563
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,093
No, I didn't punch her.

564
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:08,517
You're a moron.

565
00:28:08,568 --> 00:28:09,652
I didn't mean to.

566
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:12,154
The stick had
wicked heel curve.

567
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:13,572
Did I mention
you're a moron?

568
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:14,907
Okay, you just said
it's wrong

569
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:16,909
to treat your girlfriend
like she's weaker than you.

570
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:18,327
I'm not talking
about trying to score.

571
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:19,662
I'm talking
about shooting high.

572
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:21,864
Tennis shoes
on a wooden floor?

573
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:24,417
She obviously can't butterfly
and cover the low corners.

574
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,102
Your turn.

575
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:28,421
<i>The laptop.</i>

576
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:40,766
I must be in the midst
of a complex partial seizure,

577
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:44,186
'cause I know you are
not sitting at my desk.

578
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:46,021
Sorry.
Ran out of lotion in mine.

579
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,273
Get the hell
out of here.

580
00:28:47,357 --> 00:28:48,741
Can't. This is
the only place left

581
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:50,075
that Cuddy'll
never look for me.

582
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:51,660
And I still haven't found
what I'm looking for.

583
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:52,995
Well, I can tell you,
what you're about to find

584
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:54,580
is my foot in your ass.

585
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:56,499
I don't think we've got
enough lotion for that.

586
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:59,084
How did you even get in here?
The door was locked.

587
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:04,757
Well, either I can walk
through walls, or...

588
00:29:04,825 --> 00:29:06,075
We have liftoff.

589
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,543
Is that
Cuddy's journal?

590
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:10,629
No, it's a freelance piece
I'm writing for <i>Teen Vogue.</i>

591
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,131
No, no, no.
Let me see that.

592
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:15,584
Sorry, got to go.

593
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:17,436
Key.

594
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:24,643
<i>I got to give you</i>
<i>one thing, Hourani.</i>

595
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:27,980
Your wife--
she's beautiful.

596
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:29,448
I mean, wow.

597
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:32,468
Thank you.

598
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:42,211
<i>House!</i>

599
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:48,467
<i>Wait.</i>

600
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:50,819
I thought
<i>you</i> were Dr. Hourani.

601
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,474
<i>Yeah, who are you?</i>

602
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:03,269
So that's why you're here?

603
00:30:03,353 --> 00:30:04,754
Well, that was stupid.

604
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,606
I know.

605
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,525
Mr. Stupid-Head
at your service.

606
00:30:09,593 --> 00:30:11,627
<i>Where are you now?</i>
In the principal's office.

607
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:13,863
<i>House, we don't</i>
<i>have time for games.</i>

608
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,965
Pet scan was negative for sarcoidosis.
<i>Great.</i>

609
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,450
Means the treatment's
already working.

610
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:19,235
It would if we'd actually
started the treatment,

611
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:21,654
but we didn't.
<i>Why the hell not?</i>

612
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:23,339
Because it's
not sarcoidosis.

613
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:24,741
<i>If you were here,</i>
<i>you would know that.</i>

614
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:25,958
<i>He's dying.</i>

615
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:27,910
What's left of his lung
is collapsing.

616
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,962
F.N.A. of the mediastinal--
<i>i don't care about the F.N.A.</i>

617
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:32,215
What I care about is how
he responds to the treatment.

618
00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:33,583
House.
<i>Just do it.</i>

619
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,172
Sarcoidosis...

620
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:41,758
Is a diagnosis
of exclusion,

621
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:43,726
which means that the cowards
who spend their time

622
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:46,012
excluding what it isn't
usually cause their patients

623
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,297
to die from what it is.

624
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:49,715
I don't get it.

625
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:52,401
- Why would you lie about your name?
- Who cares?

626
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:54,020
What did she write
in her journal?

627
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,905
Thank you.

628
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:57,607
That is exactly
my point.

629
00:30:57,658 --> 00:31:00,193
Why does no one
ever believe me?

630
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,628
What?

631
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:06,215
Just because he's dying
doesn't make it interesting.

632
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,000
You cheated on her,
didn't you?

633
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:09,752
No, I didn't cheat
on her.

634
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,904
It's obviously more than
just you used her toothbrush

635
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:13,823
<i>and wouldn't take</i>
<i>the garbage out.</i>

636
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:17,176
No, actually,
it was exactly that.

637
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:18,928
I just need
some time alone.

638
00:31:18,995 --> 00:31:21,514
Because I used
your toothbrush?

639
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:24,150
And you wouldn't take out
the garbage.

640
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,502
That's insane.

641
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,837
You know that, right?

642
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:30,840
You do whatever
you want, always.

643
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,892
I said I was sorry.
I was--

644
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,627
I was still half asleep.
I wasn't paying attention.

645
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:36,229
And you're
always right.

646
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:37,563
And I don't mean you
always think you're right.

647
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:40,449
But y-you are
actually always right,

648
00:31:40,517 --> 00:31:42,618
because that's
all that matters.

649
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:45,354
That doesn't
even make sense.

650
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,206
What, you want me
to be wrong?

651
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:49,625
I want you to care about
more than just what you want,

652
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:52,145
what you think.

653
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:53,963
You need me, House.

654
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:56,165
And you may even love me.

655
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:59,552
But you don't care
about me.

656
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,923
And I deserve
someone who does.

657
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,986
That's what I said.

658
00:32:17,053 --> 00:32:18,688
You don't listen to her.

659
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:21,023
You didn't say that.

660
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:23,125
Yes, I did.

661
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:25,361
Well, I wasn't
listening, then.

662
00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:29,365
But you found a way
to fix things, right?

663
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,167
That's why you were happy
when you read her laptop.

664
00:32:31,234 --> 00:32:33,569
I did.

665
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,238
At least
I thought I did.

666
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,374
She recently got
the thin envelope

667
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:40,910
from her first choice
preschool.

668
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:44,580
But it turns out
it was her fake first choice,

669
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,349
'cause she was convinced
she couldn't get her kid

670
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,850
into her actual first choice

671
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:52,555
without a substantial donation
or an inside connection.

672
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:55,925
If it's Brye Park,
I'm afraid she's right.

673
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,944
Wait, that's
our school.

674
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:00,262
What other school
would he be talking about?

675
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:03,098
Just finish
the story.

676
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,234
You know,
I got to tell you--

677
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:07,370
there is bossy,
which can be sexy.

678
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:08,654
And then
there's bitchy--

679
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:10,389
Finish the story.

680
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,611
You obviously know this

681
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,780
because you're
on the school board,

682
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:19,248
which puts you
on the inside,

683
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,635
and being the CEO here obviously
connects you with Cuddy.

684
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:26,222
Well, if we're so connected,
why isn't she the one asking?

685
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:27,974
Because she thinks
it's wrong

686
00:33:28,058 --> 00:33:30,559
to use connections
to cut in line.

687
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:31,677
I don't.

688
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,649
I might be able to help.
Fantastic.

689
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:39,268
But I could use
a favor as well.

690
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,653
<i>Where are you?</i>

691
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:42,104
I needed to take care
of something.

692
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:43,472
<i>It's not a foreign body.</i>

693
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,523
<i>You must have missed it.</i>

694
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:45,925
If we do any more imaging,

695
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:47,977
we're gonna have to add
radiation poisoning to the DDX.

696
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,695
I meant
the sarcoidosis.

697
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,163
<i>The biopsy and c-ANCA</i>

698
00:33:51,248 --> 00:33:52,281
were both negative.

699
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:53,983
We're gonna have to do a pneumon.

700
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,335
<i>No sign of drug</i>
<i>or alcohol abuse.</i>

701
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,422
He's not a smoker, a coal miner,
or a potter--it's sarcoidosis.

702
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:01,173
<i>Start him on corticosteroids</i>
<i>and methotrexate.</i>

703
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:03,526
If it's a drug-resistant bug,
and we give him steroids--

704
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:04,827
<i>He'll die,</i>

705
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,796
which from the sound of it
wouldn't be much worse.

706
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:11,500
You moron.

707
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,567
But you have
to show him your I.D.

708
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,202
And your insurance stuff.

709
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:32,204
You can't just
give him a fake name.

710
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:33,873
You don't have
to do anything.

711
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,692
Last time I checked,
this was still America.

712
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,128
Of course,
that was ten years ago.

713
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:43,249
But you're gonna pay him, right?
I mean, it was your fault.

714
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,134
A yellow light
does not mean stop.

715
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:47,887
It was, at the most,
20% my fault.

716
00:34:47,971 --> 00:34:50,806
Since insurance companies
automatically put

717
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:53,476
100% of the fault
on the rear-ender,

718
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:56,679
my little lie
was actually an effort

719
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,317
to achieve an outcome
closer to the truth.

720
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:03,319
And it would
have worked, too,

721
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:06,489
if it weren't
for those meddling kids.

722
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:08,791
I am Dr. Hourani.

723
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,327
Then why did you say
the other doctor was Hourani?

724
00:35:11,394 --> 00:35:13,779
<i>It's, uh--</i>
<i>it's a common name.</i>

725
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:16,565
It's like Smith...

726
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:18,400
In Lebanon.

727
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:21,003
- Let me see your I.D.
- I told you, I left it in my other pants.

728
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,916
Really? 'Cause it looks
like it's still in this pair.

729
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:23,564
Get your hands off me.

730
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,874
Give me your I.D.

731
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:26,792
- Hey, would you stop that?
- Give me your I.D.

732
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:28,711
Gentlemen, please.

733
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:29,795
<i>Kids, stay calm.</i>

734
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,180
Gimme your I.D.!

735
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:32,715
Stop this right now!
Stay in your seats, kids.

736
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:35,434
<i>Stay calm, you guys.</i>
<i>Stay in your seats.</i>

737
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,219
Gentlemen, please.
This is not the time or place.

738
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:44,693
Is there a problem in here,
Ms. Corwin?

739
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,623
Why don't you
just take off?

740
00:35:57,707 --> 00:36:00,342
It's not like the principal
can call your parents.

741
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,245
No, but the principal
can call the police

742
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:05,664
or the guy he's doing
the favor for.

743
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,167
His girlfriend's
obviously gonna find out.

744
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:09,718
He's screwed.

745
00:36:09,786 --> 00:36:11,420
- I'd bolt.
- No, you wouldn't.

746
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,606
Yeah, I would.

747
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,674
No, you wouldn't.

748
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:19,979
How do you know?

749
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:33,075
What's wrong?

750
00:36:33,142 --> 00:36:34,643
I guess...

751
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:37,196
I don't want to do it
like this.

752
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,815
Sorry for shooting
the puck so hard

753
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:42,501
and tricking you
in the bet.

754
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:45,204
- You didn't trick me.
- Yeah, I did.

755
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:48,040
I gave Madison
a <i>Red Dead Revolver</i> cheat code

756
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:50,376
so she'd hit your foot
with the rope.

757
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,664
I knew you
couldn't beat me.

758
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,332
You're right.
It's just...

759
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,685
I really like you.

760
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:01,937
And I'm pretty sure
you like me too.

761
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:05,357
But I don't want to play
any more games.

762
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,345
When you want--
I mean, if you ever want to,

763
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:13,449
just tell me
you're ready,

764
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:16,368
and, you know...

765
00:37:16,453 --> 00:37:18,153
Sorry.

766
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:31,133
Well done.

767
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:34,803
He's not
always a jerk.

768
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,224
And neither
are you.

769
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,726
She obviously
likes you.

770
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,163
Just stop using her toothbrush
and stop playing games.

771
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:47,499
<i>She'll still like you.</i>

772
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:51,103
She's bossy...

773
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,939
But she's usually right.

774
00:38:07,504 --> 00:38:08,671
Thank you.

775
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:10,873
Dr. House, can I ask you
a question?

776
00:38:10,924 --> 00:38:13,392
Are you insane
or just stupid?

777
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,097
Is there a third option?

778
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:20,633
Actually,
I don't think there is.

779
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:28,190
I'm sorry.
I-I just wasn't thinking.

780
00:38:28,257 --> 00:38:31,226
I mean, I was,
but only about myself,

781
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:33,896
which is apparently
the way I am...

782
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:38,033
Usually, not always.

783
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:40,319
And I need to convince
someone of that.

784
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:41,603
Mm-hmm.

785
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:43,539
And you think you can do that
by getting someone

786
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:48,243
to pull strings to get
her daughter into our preschool.

787
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:50,929
I spoke
to Sanford Wells.

788
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:56,302
You can call the police.

789
00:38:56,386 --> 00:38:59,121
You can turn me in
for lying at the accident.

790
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:01,590
Oh, I'm sure Mr. Dryden
has already taken care of that.

791
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:04,560
Let her daughter in.

792
00:39:04,627 --> 00:39:07,680
She's a great kid,
and Dr. Cuddy is a great mom.

793
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,715
They'll fit in
perfectly here.

794
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,435
And how exactly
does admitting her daughter

795
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:16,822
prove how unselfish
you are?

796
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,108
Seems like you're still
doing it to help yourself,

797
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:22,310
not anyone else.

798
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,813
I don't know.

799
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:28,367
I just know that
I need to do something.

800
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,520
I need her in my life.

801
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:37,826
You know what it's like
to actually need someone?

802
00:39:41,398 --> 00:39:44,500
Yes.

803
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:47,169
I do.

804
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,103
But I also know what it's like
to have responsibilities.

805
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:55,757
<i>Maybe it's time</i>
<i>you grew up.</i>

806
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:06,300
<i>Dr. House...</i>

807
00:40:06,368 --> 00:40:08,636
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

808
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,606
Can I be excused?

809
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:20,165
It's just food.

810
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:22,565
Something small enough
to go down the wrong pipe,

811
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:25,018
too big to get washed out
by the bronchial lavage.

812
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:27,904
Wouldn't show up
on a C.T.

813
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:29,606
<i>But would cause</i>
<i>the C.O.P.D.</i>

814
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:32,709
And wouldn't respond
to steroids or antibiotics.

815
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:34,444
<i>Prep him</i>
<i>for exploratory surgery</i>

816
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:35,695
and start the betting.

817
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,946
Betting?

818
00:40:36,998 --> 00:40:40,149
I got a hundred bucks
says it's a pea.

819
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:50,293
I'm busy.

820
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:52,328
I know.

821
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:01,504
I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

822
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:07,093
Shouldn't you be saying that
to Sanford Wells?

823
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:09,813
A fifth-grade
career day?

824
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:13,817
You really thought
you could pull that off?

825
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:16,352
I figured,
how hard could it be?

826
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,341
And I wanted to prove
to you

827
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:24,627
that I do care
about your needs

828
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:27,514
and Rachel's.

829
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:30,617
I do.

830
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,188
Is that why
you also stole my computer?

831
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:37,157
Yes, it is.

832
00:41:37,224 --> 00:41:39,225
And then threw it
in the trash?

833
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,694
I did not throw it,
I placed it,

834
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:43,363
knowing that the janitor
would find it

835
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:46,533
and know it was yours
and return it to you unharmed.

836
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:48,184
I'm a moron.

837
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:50,537
But that doesn't mean
I-I don't care about you,

838
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:52,021
that I don't think
about you,

839
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:55,058
that I don't want you
to be happy.

840
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:58,027
I was wrong.
You were right.

841
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,529
I can do better.

842
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,532
Just...give me a chance.

843
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:08,505
So what were you--

844
00:42:08,556 --> 00:42:10,824
an Astronaut
or a Bullfighter?

845
00:42:13,928 --> 00:42:15,512
I was myself...

846
00:42:15,563 --> 00:42:17,797
For the most part.

847
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:26,656
I know you're still upset,

848
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:30,527
so I'm gonna...

849
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:35,064
I'll leave you to--to deal
with it however you want.

850
00:42:35,116 --> 00:42:36,833
House.

851
00:42:42,873 --> 00:42:45,125
You want to come over
for dinner tonight?

852
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:47,277
I'd love to.
