1
00:00:06,098 --> 00:00:08,266
House?

2
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:13,888
House?

3
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,145
Oh! My God!

4
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:22,513
What the hell?

5
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,199
Gotcha.

6
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:26,751
Did you actually
wake up early

7
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,037
and hide under the bed just
to scare the crap outta me?

8
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:31,355
Set an alarm
and everything.

9
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:33,958
It's like dating
a ten-year-old.

10
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:36,628
God, I hope not.

11
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:51,208
Now that we're down here...

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,311
Hold that thought.

13
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:54,345
Seriously?

14
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:55,730
I have to pee.

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,550
I'll wait.

16
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:02,270
I brought a book.

17
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:05,723
I didn't know what time
your alarm was set for.

18
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,241
<i>House?</i>

19
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:09,477
You know, you can rent
this space out down here.

20
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:11,446
In Japan,
that would be like a deluxe--

21
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:13,448
<i>House, shut up.</i>

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,969
There's blood in my urine.

23
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,494

25
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:30,431
You really don't
have to be here.

26
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:33,101
You're my girlfriend.
I'm being supportive.

27
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:34,969
I'm mainly
talking about them.

28
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:38,773
Well, given that
there's almost certainly

29
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:40,441
nothing wrong with you,

30
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:42,760
and my patient definitely
has something wrong with him--

31
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,278
That can't wait an hour?

32
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:45,246
'Fraid not.

33
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,815
He's...

34
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:49,450
Chase.

35
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:51,469
16-year-old male
spit up blood

36
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:52,987
during a pick-up
basketball game.

37
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,722
E.R. couldn't find
the source in his lungs

38
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,440
or GI tract.

39
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:58,242
See? Serious.

40
00:01:58,293 --> 00:02:00,611
<i>Could be vasculitis,</i>
<i>bronchiectasis,</i>

41
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,497
inhaled particles.
What about angiodysplasia?

42
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,432
Ready
when you are...

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,167
Get them outta here.

44
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:08,753
<i>My urethra is not</i>
<i>for public entertainment.</i>

45
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:11,222
But it is
a good-time adjacent.

46
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:12,289
Feed the kid a camera.

47
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,226
Check his got for
angiodysplasia.

48
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:17,562
All right.
If you could scoot down.

49
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:20,131
Hey, I'm, uh,
I'm missing a watch.

50
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,983
So can you keep your eyes open while--
<i>Okay!</i>

51
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:23,151
You too.

52
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:28,322
This little camera

53
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:31,743
transmits images
to the data recorder

54
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,077
so we can see

55
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:35,963
if you've got any
vascular malformations

56
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,481
<i>in your GI tract.</i>

57
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,317
Your records show
you've lost some weight

58
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,636
over the past year.

59
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,454
- Was that intentional?
- Not really.

60
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:44,789
<i>Well, he's been</i>

61
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:46,791
eating less
since he quit the swim team.

62
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:48,926
You have to get up early
for swim.

63
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,762
It wasn't fun anymore.

64
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,798
I need to talk to your son
about sexual activity.

65
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,383
<i>Generally, it's less</i>
<i>embarrassing for everyone--</i>

66
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,668
We're leaving.

67
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:03,191
Actually, I've only--

68
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:06,010
How long have you been
cutting yourself?

69
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:12,033
Those are from a layback grind
that went wrong.

70
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,035
Came off my skateboard
straight into a fence.

71
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:15,903
So...no to cutting

72
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:18,606
but yes to appetite
and sleep changes,

73
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:22,076
and you quit something
you used to enjoy.

74
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,312
How long have you
been depressed?

75
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:28,082
<i>Imaging showed no sign</i>

76
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,550
of upper GI issues.

77
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,085
But the kid did admit
to being depressed

78
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,055
and to smoking pot
to take the edge off.

79
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,557
You are very pleased
with yourself, aren't you?

80
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,760
His marijuana could be laced
with formaldehyde or lead,

81
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,377
which could cause
a pulmonary hemorrhage

82
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,780
which could make him
spit up blood.

83
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,683
Yes. Yes, I am.
I thought it was a good catch.

84
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,406
Run a lead level
and push 5 liters IV fluid.

85
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,612
Feel free to tip
your other server.

86
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,033
Cystoscopy was clean.

87
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:05,286
- Cytopathology was normal.
- Why do you have my lab results?

88
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,621
I don't.

89
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,572
If I did,
I'd know you were fine.

90
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,175
Unless the blood
came from my kidneys.

91
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:13,094
Come on.
Your hypochondriac mom

92
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:15,913
had a brush with mortality
last month,

93
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,100
and it's understandable that
you're worrying more than usual,

94
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:22,603
worrying that you might
turn into her.

95
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,642
You're right.

96
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,146
Odds are,
this is nothing.

97
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,650
Meet me in the cafeteria
in ten.

98
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,486
There'll be a corn dog
with your name on it.

99
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,856
I mean an actual corn dog.
They fixed the deep fryer.

100
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,052
I need to schedule
an ultrasound.

101
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,757
My dad's head's
still in one piece,

102
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:01,976
so I'm guessing you didn't
mention the pot.

103
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,127
<i>What'd you tell him?</i>

104
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,179
The truth.
You had a...

105
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,564
minor chemical exposure,

106
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:08,783
and we can't be 100% sure
how it happened.

107
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,518
Thanks for covering.

108
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,987
I know what it's like
to be 16.

109
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,655
You also know what
it's like to be depressed.

110
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,474
You figured out my deal
after only a few minutes,

111
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,144
but I been fooling my friends
and parents for months.

112
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,114
It's my job to notice things.

113
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:25,917
Maybe talking to your parents
would make things better.

114
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:27,285
I've tried.

115
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,754
They take it personally
that I'm not happy,

116
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:33,124
and then I end up having
to make them feel better.

117
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:35,476
They don't get me.

118
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,879
No one does.

119
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:44,335
In Med School,
it seemed like

120
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:47,004
everybody else
could handle the pressure.

121
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,274
I couldn't.

122
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,312
I ended up hurting myself.

123
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:58,199
Stupidest thing
I've ever done.

124
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,973
You've got red spots
in your eyes.

125
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,160
They weren't there
before.

126
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,901
You have nice skin.

127
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:18,535
Thank you.
Shut up!

128
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,339
Sorry. Just thought it would
be rude not to comment.

129
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:23,424
Just treat me like
any other patient.

130
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,543
Right.

131
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:29,146
Are you sucking in
your stomach?

132
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:30,097
No.

133
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:33,884
Hurry up before I pass out.

134
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,572
Wilson?

135
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,262
Ultrasound isn't definitive.

136
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,697
We should run other
tests before--

137
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:50,401
Stop talking like a doctor
and tell me what you see.

138
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,837
There's a mass
in your kidney.

139
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:00,483
We still don't know
why Ryan coughed blood,

140
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:03,569
and now he's got small
hemorrhages in his eyes.

141
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:05,044
Sounds like an acquired
coagulapathy

142
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:06,629
which gives us
a pretty wide differential.

143
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:07,746
Gets a lot narrower

144
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:09,014
if we factor in
his depression.

145
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:10,382
Oh, don't do that!

146
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:13,602
Mood swings can be a symptom
of physiological illness.

147
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:14,804
I'm not talking to you.

148
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:16,806
Mood swings are also
a symptom of adolescence

149
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,241
along with emo music
and masturbation.

150
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:20,526
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>his weight loss</i>

151
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:22,094
<i>and sleeping issues</i>
<i>started a year ago.</i>

152
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,562
<i>Infection makes the most sense.</i>

153
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:25,731
He shoots hoops at school,
showers in the locker room.

154
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:27,817
- I'm thinking staph.
- Damn!

155
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,235
You don't think--

156
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:30,319
Not talking to you!

157
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:35,324
- Everything okay with Cuddy?
- She's fine.

158
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:36,992
She's just too stupid
to accept it.

159
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:39,444
Start him on nafcillin
for staph.

160
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:42,681
All that's in the, uh,

161
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:44,917
First Mutual safety
deposit box.

162
00:07:44,985 --> 00:07:46,168
The retirement accounts--

163
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,590
You're freaking out
because of one ultrasound

164
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,560
performed by an incompetent
bonobo monkey.

165
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,145
As demonstrated
by my sitting here calmly

166
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:57,263
going about my business.

167
00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:59,582
Calling a lawyer,
drafting a will!

168
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,933
Okay. I-I...

169
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:03,152
hacked into your
online schedule.

170
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:05,271
Look, tests always
show something.

171
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:07,156
A mass in your kidney
could be a complex cyst.

172
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:09,158
- <i>It could be benign.</i>
- <i>I'm a single mom.</i>

173
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:11,160
I need to set up a trust,
appoint a guardian.

174
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:12,945
It's silly that I haven't
done it before now.

175
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:14,864
<i>But you're doing it now</i>
<i>because you think you're sick.</i>

176
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:16,198
The freaking out
can at least wait

177
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:17,917
until after the biopsy
this afternoon.

178
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,118
The biopsy's
not till tomorrow.

179
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,370
It's the first opening
in the schedule.

180
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:22,504
For the Dean of Medicine,

181
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,373
the first opening
in the schedule is...

182
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:26,008
Oh, look! Now.

183
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:28,127
My worry isn't any more
important than anyone else's.

184
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:29,295
Actually, it is.

185
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:31,130
But I'm not sick, right?

186
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,835
Good point.

187
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:44,627
I want my stuff,
asshat.

188
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:45,811
I told you, man,
I don't have it here.

189
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,012
<i>Hey...</i>

190
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:48,814
Guys.

191
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:50,649
Everything okay?

192
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,984
On my way out.

193
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:54,203
I'll see you later.

194
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:02,995
You wanna...
tell me what's going on?

195
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:11,870
My friend gave me some
leftover Klonopin he had

196
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:14,390
when he switched
his seizure meds.

197
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:16,075
I sold them thru Roid Rage
for 80 bucks,

198
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:18,143
but I landed in here
before I could deliver,

199
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:20,512
and now he's gonna
rip my arms off.

200
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:22,114
How often
do you sell drugs?

201
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:24,733
It was a one-time thing.

202
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:26,235
<i>I needed the cash,</i>
<i>I had the pills,</i>

203
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,487
<i>so I thought, "why not?"</i>

204
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,122
It was a bad idea.

205
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:33,558
The pills are at my house.

206
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,945
I could have a friend
go get them.

207
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,006
Give the thug
his money back.

208
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:51,460
One time only.

209
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,349
I mean,
if you're okay with this.

210
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,018
You have three kids
of your own.

211
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:00,419
It's not even a question.

212
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,638
Of course I'll be
Rachel's guardian.

213
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:03,973
And House
is cool with this?

214
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:05,441
I mean, you guys...

215
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:07,026
We've only been together
a few months.

216
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:08,477
Hmm. Seems like
a lot longer.

217
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:11,063
Probably because you've been
talking about him for ten years.

218
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:12,698
And by talking,
I mean ranting about

219
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,233
wanting
to smash his teeth in

220
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:16,935
with a stapler
for being such a jerk.

221
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,589
People change.

222
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,161
I'll get it.

223
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:28,330
<i>That better be her!</i>

224
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:31,166
Ooh!

225
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:34,937
Rachel Cuddy, you were supposed
to be home half an hour ago.

226
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:36,338
Don't blame me--
he's the one

227
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:37,756
who wouldn't
run any red lights.

228
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:43,312
Mouth on that kid

229
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:46,915
makes Mel Gibson sound like
Nelson Mandela.

230
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:47,966
Where'd she learn that?

231
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:53,472
I don't know why
you're here,

232
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:54,990
but I didn't do it.

233
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:57,993
What's the problem,
officer?

234
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,661
She was shoplifting
down at the mall.

235
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:01,280
Aw!

236
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:02,948
Are either of you
this girl's father?

237
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,816
Nope. But since
her mom died,

238
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:07,002
she's my favorite
tax write-off.

239
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,821
Officer, you have my word
it won't happen again.

240
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,290
'Cause next time...

241
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,759
she won't get caught!

242
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,899
It's no big deal.

243
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:38,850
Good for you.

244
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:40,969
You could have just
assumed he was a drug dealer,

245
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:42,871
but instead you
took his word for it.

246
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:44,873
<i>It's nice to finally</i>
<i>see someone</i>

247
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:48,677
have a little faith
in humanity around here.

248
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:50,879
Why would you do that?

249
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:55,367
Ryan, you okay in there?
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

250
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:00,773
I think I just peed blood.

251
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,434
Looks like peeing blood
is the new black.

252
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:10,934
<i>Peeing blood after a night</i>
<i>on antibiotics</i>

253
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:13,236
means we can move on
from infections.

254
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:15,172
Scoping showed no sign
of a bleed in his bladder,

255
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:17,641
which points to a kidney problem.
Probably some kinda mass.

256
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:18,909
<i>Kidney mass wouldn't</i>
<i>explain the coughing blood</i>

257
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:20,327
or the hemorrhages.

258
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:21,978
Antiphospholipid syndrome,
on the other hand...

259
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:24,764
Makes sense.
But doesn't rule out a mass.

260
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:26,116
<i>You think it's cancer?</i>

261
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,717
Mass doesn't have to be
cancer.

262
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:28,869
Could be
renal hematoma.

263
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:30,120
But the patient
doesn't have

264
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:32,489
any other abdominal trauma.
<i>He's...</i>

265
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:33,874
not talking about
the patient.

266
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:38,111
Cuddy has a mass
on her kidney?

267
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:39,462
It's probably
just a complex cyst

268
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:42,165
or angiomyolipoma.

269
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:43,550
It's a mass, not a mystery.

270
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:46,636
They'll do the biopsy,
then you'll have your answer.

271
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:49,055
Just...have to wait.

272
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:51,708
Patient admitted
to using pot.

273
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:53,527
Who knows what else
he's doing.

274
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:55,862
This could be
a heroin-induced nephropathy.

275
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,464
I thought
you trusted this kid.

276
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:59,766
And then you pointed out
how sweet that was.

277
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,535
<i>If it were heroin, he'd be</i>
<i>going through withdrawal.</i>

278
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,519
Antiphospholipid syndrome's
a better fit.

279
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:05,705
Start the patient
on plasmapheresis.

280
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,023
While he's doing that,

281
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:09,292
can I at least search
his house for drugs?

282
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,077
Have I ever said no
to that question?

283
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:16,917
What are you doing here?

284
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,619
Pie-eating contest.

285
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,105
Cuddy's biopsy
is in an hour.

286
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:23,640
You should be
keeping her company.

287
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,062
<i>Okay. You've been worried</i>
<i>that your relationship</i>

288
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,647
is getting in the way
of your diagnoses,

289
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:31,898
you're protecting
your patient.

290
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:34,484
<i>Either that or...</i>
<i>you're an ass.</i>

291
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:36,920
Three--I hate
the smell of death.

292
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:40,991
The chances of Cuddy
having renal cell carcinoma--

293
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:43,026
I'm talking about
our relationship.

294
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:44,394
<i>She needs support</i>
<i>and comfort,</i>

295
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:46,279
both things
that I famously suck at.

296
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:48,582
This will inevitably
lead to--

297
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,284
you know what's good
for that? Practice.

298
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:54,287
Doing it--I don't know--
once?

299
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,122
I'm not gonna act like
there's a crisis

300
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,507
before we know
there is one.

301
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:59,242
There's no proof
there's anything wrong with her.

302
00:13:59,293 --> 00:14:00,760
There's no proof
she's being stalked

303
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:02,229
by Ninja squirrels
either,

304
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,097
but if she's scared
of them...

305
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:06,600
as her boyfriend,
it's your job to figure out

306
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,785
how to help her
feel better.

307
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:15,175
You're right.

308
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:26,653
House told me
to keep you company.

309
00:14:26,737 --> 00:14:29,155
Nurse told me to give you
antibiotics.

310
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,208
Tell House I'm fine.

311
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:35,462
Mm!

312
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:40,550
Tom Cruise got married.

313
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,811
Do you want me to quote
from First Corinthians?

314
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,314
'Cause I can do that.
<i>As a Jew,</i>

315
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:56,066
I'm gonna have
to decline that offer.

316
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,384
Don't know what
you're missing.

317
00:14:57,451 --> 00:14:58,985
St. Paul
was really on his game.

318
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:08,161
He'll show up eventually.

319
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,864
You don't actually
believe that.

320
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:12,782
But I do.

321
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,167
All these years,

322
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:15,785
he's never stopped
trying to annoy me

323
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:18,204
for more than 15 minutes.

324
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:21,124
And now he can't even
walk into the room.

325
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:26,429
Love hopes all things.

326
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:32,185
What is it with you
and this kid?

327
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:34,437
He's doggy paddling
in a sea of misery.

328
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:35,772
I remember what it's like.

329
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,724
How far did you have to
reach back for that memory,

330
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,442
last night?

331
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,277
Sometimes I hear you
in the living room

332
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:42,696
watching TV
at 3:00 a.m.

333
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,181
That's when classic <i>Dr. Who</i>
comes on the BBC.

334
00:15:45,232 --> 00:15:47,317
Yeah. If only they had
some device

335
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:48,684
that allowed you
to record them

336
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:50,320
and watch them
another time.

337
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:52,288
I'm just saying...

338
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:55,024
I don't think fixing this kid
is gonna fix you.

339
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:57,811
Yep?

340
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:59,963
We're on our way back.

341
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,365
Our patient lost all feeling
in his right arm.

342
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,200
Look at this.

343
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:35,749
Chase?

344
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,535
How'd it go with Cuddy?

345
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,588
Chase?

346
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:59,139
Aah!

347
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:23,663
Good thing
I brought my ax cane.

348
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:27,950
<i>House...help me!</i>

349
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:30,053
I'm coming!

350
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:35,391
<i>House...please!</i>

351
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:40,230
It looks like
we got company.

352
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:02,035
<i>House!</i>

353
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,287
<i>Aah...aah!</i>

354
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:10,293
d d

355
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:12,161
<i>Aah...aah!</i>

356
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:21,638
No!

357
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:22,605
Ah...

358
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:26,342
Are you okay?

359
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:29,729
I was sleeping.

360
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:31,731
What could go wrong?

361
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:38,584
<i>Patient lost feeling in his arm</i>

362
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,951
<i>while on steroids--</i>
<i>rules out autoimmune.</i>

363
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,792
<i>So what causes bleeding,</i>
<i>kidney problems,</i>

364
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,477
and unilateral numbness?

365
00:18:44,562 --> 00:18:46,396
And a complete absence
of any record

366
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,565
of Cuddy's kidney biopsy.

367
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:50,483
She must have put it
under a false name

368
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:52,485
so I couldn't
rush the results.

369
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,771
<i>What if we had it backwards</i>

370
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:56,739
and it's not a bleeding problem,
it's a clotting problem?

371
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:59,275
There's no patient file
created in the last two days

372
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:01,411
for anyone having
that procedure.

373
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,529
<i>She backdated the file?</i>

374
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:04,280
That's very clever.

375
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:06,116
Hands off.
She's mine.

376
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:07,267
<i>Clots could explain</i>
<i>everything</i>

377
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:08,568
including the numbness.

378
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:10,319
We should do an angiogram
of his brain,

379
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:12,321
<i>see if we can find it.</i>

380
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:17,477
<i>House.</i>

381
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:18,628
We're worried too.

382
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,347
How sweet.

383
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:22,849
I'm not worried.

384
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:25,268
I just wanna get the results
so she can stop worrying.

385
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:27,170
- Okay, but in the meantime--
- Do an angiogram.

386
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:29,889
You two go to pathology
and look at Cuddy's slides.

387
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:32,008
You just said you didn't know
which sample was hers.

388
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,526
I guess you're gonna
have to look at them all.

389
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:39,949
<i>Bigger question--</i>
<i>What's the deal with Taub?</i>

390
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:42,351
Just because House
is too distracted

391
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:44,487
to notice your distraction
doesn't mean we didn't.

392
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:46,573
Clots, angiograms--
I'm focused.

393
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:49,292
The kid scratched out
the faces of half his class.

394
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,577
You don't think
that's a problem?

395
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:51,794
It's not our problem.

396
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,246
Why is it anyone's problem?

397
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,582
I violently executed
my tenth grade geometry teacher

398
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,500
about five different ways
in my mind.

399
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:58,835
I didn't want
to kill anybody.

400
00:19:58,886 --> 00:20:01,704
I just wanted to torture
them slowly in my basement,

401
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:03,173
preferably with acid.

402
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:08,511
You guys ever think about
what you might to do House?

403
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:17,487
Maybe it's no big deal.

404
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:19,072
Unless it is.

405
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:21,491
Someone shot House.

406
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:32,835
What are you doing?

407
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:34,621
Pie-eating contest.

408
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:37,540
I was going to send Chase

409
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:39,959
to tell you what the obvious
right thing to do here is,

410
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,544
but then I realized...

411
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:44,130
if you were too stupid
to know how stupid that was,

412
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:45,832
you might miss the irony.

413
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,750
You have to be
with her.

414
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:49,852
Yeah. I get it.

415
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,054
She needs artificial
support

416
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:52,805
for an artificial problem.

417
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,159
She's fine.
Chase did an excellent job.

418
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:58,111
She doesn't sleep
with Chase.

419
00:20:58,195 --> 00:20:59,479
We don't know that.

420
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:00,630
<i>Hey!</i>

421
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,782
Eating pie in here.

422
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:04,934
House...

423
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:06,869
<i>I'm not gonna tell you</i>
<i>a third time.</i>

424
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:08,271
Do not screw this up.

425
00:21:08,322 --> 00:21:11,440
Because I really don't
wanna clean up the mess.

426
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:14,961
He's referring to the pie.

427
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:16,796
<i>14 patients</i>
<i>with kidney biopsies.</i>

428
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,717
I tabulated them against
their urinalysis results.

429
00:21:20,784 --> 00:21:22,635
<i>Six men, three diabetics,</i>

430
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,587
<i>one lcdd, one kid,</i>
<i>two seniors,</i>

431
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:28,258
and by default,
one...Cuddy.

432
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:32,679
Uh...the biopsy
was inconclusive.

433
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:34,647
The mass is near
the center of her kidney.

434
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:37,066
They couldn't get
a readable sample.

435
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:39,319
Means they'll have to
remove the mass

436
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:41,321
to know if it's cancer
or not.

437
00:21:41,388 --> 00:21:42,739
<i>The file says</i>

438
00:21:42,806 --> 00:21:44,157
they're doing
some imaging now,

439
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:47,060
give the surgeon a better
idea of what he's dealing with.

440
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,152
<i>Can we order pizza?</i>

441
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:58,271
There's nothing
in the fridge.

442
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,256
At least not anymore.

443
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:03,293
What's happening
with the patient?

444
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:04,627
Angio showed a clot

445
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:06,629
in a branch of his
middle cerebral artery.

446
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,882
Started him on streptokinase
to break it up.

447
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:13,502
Although...maybe we should
have just played a few rounds

448
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:16,222
<i>of</i> Savagescape 2: The Revenge,
<i>because that's obviously</i>

449
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:17,907
the best way to make someone
feel better.

450
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:21,244
You keep talking like Wilson,
your face will freeze like that.

451
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:24,063
Look, however bad you think
you're gonna be in that room,

452
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:26,799
not being in the room
is worse.

453
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:33,706
When she breaks up
with you...

454
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,125
you're playing by yourself.

455
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:41,964
Honey, I'm home.

456
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:44,917
Just in time.
Pot roast is ready.

457
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:47,053
Smells wonderful!

458
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:48,537
I cured all my patients,

459
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:50,723
so I came home to spend
time with Rachel.

460
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:52,842
And how was your day
today?

461
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,127
It was great, ma!

462
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:56,212
I got 100%
on my spelling test

463
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:58,598
and 170 on my LSATs!

464
00:22:58,682 --> 00:23:01,484
Your LSATs?
You're eight years old.

465
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:03,019
We've been studying
together.

466
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,738
It was supposed to be
a surprise.

467
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:08,908
Well, that's wonderful.

468
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:10,276
<i>I think Rachel</i>

469
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:11,661
deserves a treat.

470
00:23:11,728 --> 00:23:12,912
No, thanks, daddy.

471
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:14,914
It might spoil my appetite.

472
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,401
Well, who could that be?

473
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:23,172
Delivery for you,
Mrs. House.

474
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,408
Happy 29th birthday.

475
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:28,044
I'm not 29!

476
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,748
You're not limping.

477
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,135
This isn't possible.

478
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,639
None of this is possible.

479
00:23:39,723 --> 00:23:42,308
Girl can dream.

480
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:55,037
You run out of sugar?

481
00:23:56,606 --> 00:24:00,026
Got your scans back
from today.

482
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:17,977
Yeah.

483
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:27,653
Okay.

484
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:32,675
What's going on?

485
00:24:35,812 --> 00:24:38,147
Imaging shows enhancing masses

486
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:41,033
across multiple lobes
of Cuddy's lungs.

487
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:47,106
That's what kidney cancer
looks like when it metastasizes.

488
00:24:51,145 --> 00:24:53,162
She's dead.

489
00:24:58,336 --> 00:24:59,837
What's up, losers?

490
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:01,972
I hope you're enjoying
being alive.

491
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,174
Today's lesson:
Natural selection.

492
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:06,644
Excellent system.
Made us who we are today.

493
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:09,096
But then we invented seat belts
and grocery stores,

494
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,732
things that keep idiots
and weaklings alive.

495
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:13,651
And let's be honest.

496
00:25:13,718 --> 00:25:15,653
Most of you
don't really deserve it.

497
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,608
Here's to the natural order.

498
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:28,916
Yes!

499
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,086
<i>Whoo!</i>

500
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,837
Copied
from his flash drive.

501
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:36,090
Do I go to the cops?

502
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:38,442
Yes. "Officer, I'd like
to report an assault.

503
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,128
The victim
was a pile of leaves."

504
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:42,463
It goes on.

505
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:43,864
He talks about
bombing his school.

506
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:45,699
Which you know because
you stole his flash drive

507
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,368
and broke into his house.

508
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:49,419
How's that gonna play?

509
00:25:49,471 --> 00:25:51,639
<i>Ryan's not responding</i>
<i>to streptokinase.</i>

510
00:25:51,723 --> 00:25:53,390
We don't have very long
before the damage

511
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:54,942
becomes irreversible.

512
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:56,310
So we either up his dosage

513
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:58,445
or go into his head
and get the clot out.

514
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,030
- <i>Where's House?</i>
- <i>Hopefully with Cuddy.</i>

515
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:02,149
She did just get
some pretty awful news.

516
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:03,434
I called her.

517
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:05,419
She doesn't know
where he is either.

518
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:12,509
Have you seen House?

519
00:26:12,577 --> 00:26:14,044
No.

520
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,916
He left my place
last night after you called.

521
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:20,417
No one's seen him today.

522
00:26:20,468 --> 00:26:22,419
Any idea where he'd be?

523
00:26:22,487 --> 00:26:24,588
No.

524
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:28,142
And you're not...
worried about that?

525
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:30,394
He's not good
with bad news.

526
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:32,479
Yes. I'm worried.

527
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,431
But this isn't about House.
It's about Cuddy.

528
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:36,066
She's the one
who could be dying,

529
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:37,651
and he's trying to
make this about himself.

530
00:26:37,736 --> 00:26:39,520
I'm not playing.

531
00:26:39,604 --> 00:26:41,238
Okay...

532
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:46,527
She still believes
he'll show up.

533
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:49,296
He'll either get over himself

534
00:26:49,364 --> 00:26:52,583
and be who she needs him to be

535
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,969
or he won't.

536
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,156
We'd like to do an embolectomy.

537
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,925
We'll run a corkscrew-shaped
instrument into Ryan's brain

538
00:27:01,993 --> 00:27:05,462
<i>and pull the clot out.</i>

539
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:07,047
Okay.

540
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:08,298
<i>Have you talked</i>
<i>to him about it?</i>

541
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:11,602
Yes. But I wanted
to see you alone.

542
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:14,671
I saw some videos that Ryan
made a few weeks ago.

543
00:27:14,723 --> 00:27:16,857
He's blowing up pipe bombs

544
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:19,109
and threatening people
in his school.

545
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:20,227
<i>Oh, God!</i>

546
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:21,344
He was probably
just messing around.

547
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:22,345
Our son wouldn't
hurt anybody.

548
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:24,064
I'm not so sure.

549
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:25,649
<i>I know this looks bad,</i>

550
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,517
but Ryan's a good kid.

551
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:30,504
He's had a rough couple years
since he started high school,

552
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:32,022
but I really think
he'll come out of it.

553
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,574
He needs help.
Maybe he does,

554
00:27:33,658 --> 00:27:35,709
but if this gets out,
he'll be suspended,

555
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,694
maybe expelled.

556
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:40,147
How about you focus
on keeping him alive?

557
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:42,199
What are you
gonna do?

558
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,801
What do you think
I should do?

559
00:27:43,868 --> 00:27:45,035
Pssh. Ha.

560
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:46,286
So you can do
the opposite?

561
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:48,672
There are kids
all over the country

562
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,891
doing dumb,
potentially violent things,

563
00:27:50,975 --> 00:27:53,911
but the percentage of them
who would actually kill anybody

564
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:55,229
is miniscule.

565
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:56,947
So I shouldn't do
anything.

566
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:58,949
Mm...while the odds
are low,

567
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:01,568
the fallout could be...
huge.

568
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:03,553
Tens or even hundreds
of lives.

569
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:05,906
So I should call
the cops.

570
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,891
Of course, over-identification
with the subject

571
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:11,378
could skew the calculation
towards being extra-protective.

572
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:13,280
Or alternatively--

573
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:15,816
You suck at this.

574
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:21,121
Hate the statistics...

575
00:28:21,206 --> 00:28:22,956
not the statistician.

576
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:29,546
Give me a little more dye.

577
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,750
<i>There's the clot.</i>

578
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:41,258
It just disintegrated
when you touched it.

579
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:44,444
What was that thing?

580
00:28:57,742 --> 00:28:59,626
I got a great idea
where we should go.

581
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:00,878
I don't want
to hear it.

582
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:03,130
You're gonna love it.

583
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:04,882
Australia's finest.

584
00:29:04,949 --> 00:29:07,301
There's a great karaoke
bar in Newark--

585
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:09,002
I hate karaoke.

586
00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:12,455
They got every--
every song

587
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:14,842
by every Aussie artist.

588
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:18,645
Midnight Oil, Men at Work,
Olivia Newton John.

589
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,981
I do a mean version
of <i>Physical.</i>

590
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:23,400
And the barbecue shrimp
is amazing.

591
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,804
What about the fries?

592
00:29:27,856 --> 00:29:30,774
Hot and salty
and delicious.

593
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:41,668
Talking about food
made me hungry.

594
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:46,206
You had candy
in my other dreams.

595
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,625
Means you're stressed
at work.

596
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:51,261
All dream symbols
mean you're stressed at work.

597
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:53,163
Or castration anxiety.

598
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:54,765
No.

599
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:57,551
I was hoping...

600
00:29:57,635 --> 00:30:00,503
you'd figure out a way
to handle all this.

601
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:06,560
Maybe you can't because
you're still a child.

602
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:09,279
I can do better.

603
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:18,038
Might be too late.

604
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:26,380
House!

605
00:30:29,217 --> 00:30:30,384
Ah...

606
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:56,877
I should have been here.

607
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,331
Sorry.

608
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:08,555
I knew you'd come.

609
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:16,533
What was that thing,

610
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:18,668
<i>and why did it just dissolve</i>

611
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,036
<i>in the middle of surgery?</i>

612
00:31:20,121 --> 00:31:21,288
<i>Why is his liver shutting down?</i>

613
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,339
That thing
in his brain goes away,

614
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,823
the kid slips into a coma.

615
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,091
We started him on lactulose,

616
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:27,043
but at the rate
his liver function is declining,

617
00:31:27,128 --> 00:31:28,512
he'll be dead in a day.

618
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,881
Should we page House?

619
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:32,132
He's busy.

620
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,472
House can't do anything
for her now.

621
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,673
We need him!
By his own logic--

622
00:31:40,725 --> 00:31:42,275
<i>Patient's blood tests</i>
<i>were negative</i>

623
00:31:42,343 --> 00:31:44,778
for barbiturates
or acetaminophen.

624
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:46,563
He's not on
a high protein diet.

625
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,815
House couldn't concentrate on
the case before she was dying.

626
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,151
You think he's gonna
get in the game now?

627
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,204
If you don't make it,

628
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,122
I won't sleep with anyone
for at least a month.

629
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,657
Make it two.

630
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,493
Bitch.

631
00:32:02,663 --> 00:32:05,499
A.I.P. can cause uremia,
tank the liver.

632
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,134
It causes abdominal cramping,
not abdominal bleeding.

633
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:10,537
Oh, because fucosidosis
was such a brilliant idea?

634
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:12,539
Guys!

635
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:16,927
Type 2 citrullinemia fits.

636
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:19,095
There are no signs
of hyperlipidemia

637
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,714
or pancreatitis.
Those can take years to emerge.

638
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:22,816
Closest we've gotten.

639
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:24,234
Start him on IV
sodium benzoate

640
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,570
<i>to reduce the ammonia</i>
<i>levels in his blood.</i>

641
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:29,155
Run a genetic test
for citrullinemia.

642
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,421
Forget your troubles.

643
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:45,872

Hm.

700
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:39,696
Hi.

701
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:40,613
Hi.

702
00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:51,141
Guess who doesn't
have cancer?

703
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:53,092
Me.

704
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:55,528
Also you.

705
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:56,696
Actually, you for sure.
Me...

706
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:58,598
House.

707
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,717
Your tumor was benign.

708
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,086
An oncocytoma.

709
00:36:03,154 --> 00:36:04,954
They cut it out.
You'll be fine.

710
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:09,576
Then what was
in my lungs?

711
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:11,778
Once they ruled out
cancer,

712
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:14,614
I remembered that your mom
was allergic to antibiotics.

713
00:36:14,665 --> 00:36:16,082
So I had them test
your blood,

714
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,984
and your IGE levels
were through the roof.

715
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:20,837
Because the lung masses
were an allergic reaction.

716
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:22,906
So now you're off
the antibiotics,

717
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,908
your lungs
should clear right up.

718
00:36:29,263 --> 00:36:31,314
I brought you something.

719
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,184
Say hello to your tumor.

720
00:36:34,268 --> 00:36:35,401
Ugh!

721
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:36,736
Wait.

722
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:50,216
There are so many things
that I could be afraid of,

723
00:36:50,284 --> 00:36:52,802
and most of the time,
I manage to...

724
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,805
lock them up behind doors.

725
00:36:55,873 --> 00:36:59,659
But this happens...

726
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:02,178
all those doors
just burst open.

727
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,524
You just figured something out
about your patient, didn't you?

728
00:37:16,627 --> 00:37:18,428
Go. Do what you do.

729
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,819
Take him off the meds.

730
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,987
<i>He's got a staph infection.</i>

731
00:37:28,055 --> 00:37:29,489
You treated him for
staph three days ago.

732
00:37:29,557 --> 00:37:30,790
It didn't work.

733
00:37:30,858 --> 00:37:32,742
<i>Bacteria already</i>
<i>in his system responded.</i>

734
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,478
Once a door's been busted open,
more just keep coming.

735
00:37:36,981 --> 00:37:38,815
Oh! He's talking about
an abscess.

736
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,300
I got that.

737
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:42,235
<i>For the cheap seats,</i>

738
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,537
<i>an abscess</i>
<i>is a gooey little cream puff</i>

739
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:46,205
of infection.

740
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:48,875
Probably burst when your
little pride and homicidal joy

741
00:37:48,926 --> 00:37:51,261
took a hard foul.

742
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:52,662
It's good news.

743
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,214
If we can find the door.

744
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,485
I think I know
where it is.

745
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:05,325
What if...these aren't
from skateboarding?

746
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:07,110
The kid has been blowing up

747
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:08,661
PVC pipe bombs.

748
00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:10,396
If he got hit by shrapnel,

749
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:12,448
the body walls off
the foreign object,

750
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:13,950
which, because it's plastic,

751
00:38:14,034 --> 00:38:15,752
doesn't show up on imaging

752
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,570
and provides a perfect home
for bacteria.

753
00:38:17,621 --> 00:38:19,389
Antibiotics
attacked the infection,

754
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:20,907
causing pieces to break off.

755
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,408
Some hit the liver.

756
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:23,910
One lodged in his brain
and dissolved

757
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:25,345
when Foreman touched it.

758
00:38:25,412 --> 00:38:27,630
Once we drain the abscess
and remove the shrapnel,

759
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:29,883
the antibiotics
can do their job.

760
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:31,467
He'll be fine.

761
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,806
Which just leaves...
what are you gonna do now?

762
00:38:39,977 --> 00:38:41,194
All right.

763
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:43,930
I put the rest of the soup
in the freezer

764
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:45,932
so you'll have some
for later.

765
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:49,619
- Thanks for everything.
- Yeah.

766
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,537
- Here you go.
- I got it.

767
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:53,289
Okay.

768
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:56,292
Are you gonna
tell mom?

769
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,745
So she can show up here
to take care of you

770
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:02,782
by harassing the housekeeper
and criticizing your bathrobe?

771
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,501
Yeah. I think I'm gonna
wait a few years.

772
00:39:09,924 --> 00:39:11,557
Oh, and I moved
your sleeping pills

773
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:14,427
back in the medicine cabinet
because I just worry.

774
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,346
Rachel always calls them
candy.

775
00:39:27,024 --> 00:39:29,575
You took Vicodin.

776
00:39:33,113 --> 00:39:35,798
When you came
to my hospital room that night,

777
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:38,618
you were stoned.

778
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:50,880
How did you know?

779
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:57,103
How did I not know?

780
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,038
How did I make myself
forget for months

781
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,890
that you're an addict?

782
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:05,395
My subconscious
was trying to tell me

783
00:40:05,462 --> 00:40:07,847
you could never get
through this without drugs.

784
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,453
It was a one-time thing.

785
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,271
It's not about
the pills, House.

786
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,290
It's about what they mean.

787
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:19,492
I was scared
because I thought

788
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,527
my girlfriend might die.

789
00:40:21,578 --> 00:40:23,129
No.

790
00:40:23,196 --> 00:40:25,915
You don't take Vicodin
because you're scared.

791
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,800
You take it
so you won't feel pain.

792
00:40:27,868 --> 00:40:30,219
Everything you've ever done
is to avoid pain--

793
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:31,704
drugs, sarcasm...

794
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:33,723
Keeping everybody
at arm's length

795
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,341
so no one can hurt you.

796
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,093
As opposed to everyone else
in the world

797
00:40:37,177 --> 00:40:40,046
who goes looking for pain
like it's buried treasure?

798
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:46,069
Pain happens when you care.

799
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:47,920
Y-you can't love someone

800
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:52,442
without making yourself open
to their problems,

801
00:40:52,526 --> 00:40:55,111
their fears.

802
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:57,280
And you're not willing
to do that.

803
00:40:57,364 --> 00:40:59,532
I ca--I came
to be with you.

804
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,118
But you weren't with me,
not really.

805
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:07,290
I wanted to be.

806
00:41:09,326 --> 00:41:11,194
That's not enough.

807
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:19,685
I can do better.

808
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,975
I don't think you can.

809
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:32,698
You'll choose yourself
over everybody else

810
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:34,233
over and over again,

811
00:41:34,301 --> 00:41:35,985
because that's just
who you are.

812
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:46,162
I'm sorry.

813
00:41:46,246 --> 00:41:48,081
No. No, no, no.
Don't.

814
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:50,133
- Don't.
- I thought I could do this.

815
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,784
Don't.
Please don't.

816
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,508
Good-bye, House.
