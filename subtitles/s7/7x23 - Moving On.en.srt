1
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:27,213
Are we, uh,
almost done here?

2
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:28,915
I have to call my mother,

3
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:30,633
get my daughter,
call the hospital.

4
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,368
So he didn't threaten you?

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,203
No.

6
00:00:34,255 --> 00:00:36,222
<i>No fight?</i>
Not really.

7
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:37,707
Sounds like a yes.

8
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:43,480
<i>Was there any indication</i>
<i>that something would happen?</i>

9
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:46,099
Yeah...

10
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:49,051
Every moment
I spent with him.

11
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:53,106
He's always waiting
for something to happen.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,391
But this...

13
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:57,360
And no idea
where he is?

14
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:58,978
<i>No.</i>

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,451
These domestic situations,

16
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:07,454
<i>it's not uncommon</i>
<i>to get cold feet.</i>

17
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:09,572
Are you asking me
to file charges?

18
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:12,074
Just give me the paperwork.

19
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:15,628
If Greg House steps foot
in my hospital again,

20
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:17,311
comes anywhere near me.

21
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,967
I want him thrown in jail.

22

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,551
So...

25
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:56,503
We can use
any of these?

26
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:58,338
Yeah.

27
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:01,558
<i>And just do</i>
<i>whatever we want to her?</i>

28
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,092
That's what
they're there for.

29
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:09,149
Hey. We were just getting
to the good part.

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,851
Is there a good part?
It was performance art.

31
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:13,753
That's Afsoun Hamidi.
She's a genius.

32
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:17,290
She just won the MacArthur,
legally proving it.

33
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:19,692
Just had a retrospective
at the Tate Modern.

34
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:22,579
- Nobody reads <i>The New Yorker?</i>
- <i>Nope.</i>

35
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:25,198
But I subscribe to her patient file.
House, you should relax.

36
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:27,917
You had surgery this morning.
Minor surgery, removing a drain.

37
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:30,152
- Put there during major surgery.
- <i>My doctor says it's okay</i>

38
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:32,539
as long as I don't leave
my hospital bed.

39
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:34,657
Which doctor was that--
Seuss or J?

40
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,959
Nurse.

41
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,711
Dr. Hourani wrote it
in his chart.

42
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,405
<i>I'm surprised he approved it.</i>

43
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:47,024
I'm more surprised
you actually asked.

44
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,525
I do things like that now.

45
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:51,395
I'm making some changes...

46
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,148
Like skipping ahead
to minute 37.

47
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:05,847
What is that--
paint thinner?

48
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:19,393
I'm not gonna watch a woman
get set on fire.

49
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:21,279
Philistine.

50
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:28,636
Who's the guy with the notebook
who can't decide what to do?

51
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:29,871
<i>Her assistant.</i>

52
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:31,873
He's been instructed
not to intervene.

53
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:34,759
Spoiler alert--
he does.

54
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:41,633
For her, it is literally
heartbreaking.

55
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,304
Let the games begin.

56
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:48,523
Arrhythmia,
high hematocrit,

57
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,808
and inconsistent RR variability.
<i>You forgot about the fourth symptom--</i>

58
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:52,627
being completely crazy.

59
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:54,279
One man's crazy
is another woman's art.

60
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:58,232
Her work explores things like
gender politics and self-image.

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,934
And the pressing issue
of shaving your entire body

62
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:01,769
in public while wearing
a monkey mask.

63
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,338
She saw her mom
commit suicide

64
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:05,573
and was abused
by her stepdad for years.

65
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,408
Didn't say the crazy
wasn't motivated.

66
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,360
Well, she took that pain
and transformed it into art.

67
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,079
That's better than a lot
of the alternatives.

68
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:12,347
I still vote for nuts.

69
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:14,465
We should run a resting-state
functional MRI

70
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,584
to look for increased activity
in the dorsal nexus.

71
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,036
She's not nuts.

72
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:20,305
The monkey-mask-shaving medium
really speaks to you?

73
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:22,423
What speaks to me
is she's elevated

74
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:26,293
being full of crap
to a genuine art form

75
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:27,562
<i>and made a fortune</i>
<i>doing it.</i>

76
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:28,930
<i>People that pay 20 grand</i>

77
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:31,232
for one of her video stills,
on the other hand,

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,601
really do need
their dorsal nexi checked.

79
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:35,703
Maybe the paint thinner set off
an allergic reaction.

80
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:37,605
Not without bronchospasm.

81
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:40,525
There was a space heater
next to her in the gallery.

82
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:45,613
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

83
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:48,082
<i>It fits.</i>

84
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,251
Put her
in a hyperbaric chamber.

85
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:02,964
Thank you.

86
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:08,553
Lisa.

87
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:11,139
You're Lisa Cuddy.

88
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,740
What's this about?

89
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:14,859
I'm sorry.
I'm Jerry Barrett.

90
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:17,779
I recognize you
from the photos.

91
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:20,448
They barely do you justice.
The usual.

92
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:22,033
I'm friends
with your sister.

93
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:23,284
She showed me
your photos.

94
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,352
I-I work at the bank
across the street.

95
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:28,522
Um, Julia's my client.
She...

96
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:31,909
wanted to set us up.

97
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:34,295
Oh, I-I'm afraid you have me
mixed up with somebody else.

98
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:36,297
N-no,
I don't think so.

99
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:38,249
I-I've seen many pictures
of you several times.

100
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,868
That didn't sound
the way I wanted--

101
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,587
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

102
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:45,506
It's nice to meet you.

103
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,541
Yeah, s-say hi
to Lisa Cuddy

104
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:50,812
when you meet her
in the office you share.

105
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:54,715
Oh, thank God.

106
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:57,518
The I.C.U. isn't being attacked
by giant radioactive spiders.

107
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:58,686
Did I text you that?

108
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,571
That was meant
for my dream journal.

109
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:03,241
I wanted
to return your stuff.

110
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:04,792
Don't worry.
I didn't go AWOL.

111
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,862
I had my wife-maid
bring it over.

112
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:09,396
My sweater,

113
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,915
a coffee mug,

114
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,734
a half-used bottle of lotion,

115
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:16,204
and a DVD of <i>Marley & Me.</i>

116
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:17,789
Given your thing
for Owen Wilson,

117
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:19,791
I thought you might want
those last two back asap.

118
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,408
I don't get it.
You masturbate to Owen Wilson.

119
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,844
I meant the box.

120
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,263
Oh.

121
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,432
It's a symbolic gesture.

122
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:30,768
I want things to go back
to the way they were

123
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,303
before we started dating--

124
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:34,439
no more bad feelings,
no more issues,

125
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,357
just work.

126
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:40,111
Thanks for coming.

127
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:42,780
I haven't even spoken to you
since you hurt yourself.

128
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:44,232
I was self-destructive.

129
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:46,651
It won't happen again.

130
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:47,985
I'm making changes.

131
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,071
I'm gonna stop doing
stupid things.

132
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:54,992
Great.

133
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:57,011
<i>The smart thing to do</i>
<i>would be to talk</i>

134
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,213
about why you did it.
If you don't understand--

135
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:01,299
I think I could avoid
putting another hole in my leg

136
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:02,700
without talking
about my mother.

137
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:06,037
Well, I don't want
to find out you're wrong

138
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:09,006
by getting another phone call
from you in a bloody bathtub.

139
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:10,475
I'm a big believer
that the best way

140
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:13,761
to get past the past
is to shoot it in the head,

141
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:16,514
bury it in a deep pit,
and pour lye on it.

142
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:18,799
I'm just asking you
to talk about it.

143
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,535
You owe me.

144
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:21,819
Forget about saving
your life.

145
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:23,070
You exposed my daughter

146
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,022
to that obnoxious
pirate cartoon.

147
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:33,281
Bring me lunch tomorrow,
and we can plumb my depths.

148
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:58,656
I should have known the gallery
wasn't ventilated enough.

149
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:00,174
Hey, if it wasn't for you,
we'd be treating her

150
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:01,442
for third-degree burns, too.

151
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:03,227
<i>That was a mistake.</i>

152
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:05,112
He shouldn't have interfered.

153
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,264
<i>I told you I'm sorry.</i>

154
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:07,632
I want to share
your commitment,

155
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,984
but it's hard
for me sometimes.

156
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:11,736
Like when she read
your love letters in the middle

157
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:13,187
<i>of the New Museum?</i>

158
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:16,040
Yes,
I read <i>The New Yorker.</i>

159
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:17,792
<i>That was a year ago.</i>

160
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:20,494
And we're--
we're not together anymore.

161
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:22,997
Seriously,
you weren't really gonna let

162
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,531
that guy set you on fire.

163
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,602
He was just a plant
to get the crowd going, right?

164
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,805
If that's your interpretation,
I welcome it.

165
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:33,758
Afsoun believes explaining
her work limits its potential.

166
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:34,809
<i>But between us,</i>

167
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:37,645
he was real
and a total dick.

168
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:39,130
<i>No sane person</i>
<i>would let themselves</i>

169
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:40,848
<i>be burned alive</i>
<i>for the sake of art.</i>

170
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,067
My work is meant
to force the audience

171
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:46,103
to break with the rational
and see things in a new way.

172
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:48,472
Fine.
No sane person

173
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,191
would let themselves
be burned alive

174
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:51,459
to "break with the rational."

175
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:52,827
I feel...

176
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:01,919
Luca, hand me
the oxygen mask

177
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:03,621
<i>behind you.</i>

178
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:07,909
<i>Luca!</i>

179
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:09,894
Congratulations.

180
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:11,662
It's a gestational sac.

181
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,914
Can't see anything
this early.

182
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,349
<i>I know.</i>

183
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,351
I just figured
this would help me process

184
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:19,353
<i>what's happening.</i>

185
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,522
- There's a lot we got to figure out.
- We have almost eight months.

186
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:22,707
You're not having doubts,
are you?

187
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:23,975
No.

188
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:24,976
Are you?

189
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:26,861
Definitely not.

190
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:32,483
Nice, cozy home
for little Ruben.

191
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,869
It's a family name.

192
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:36,603
It's a sandwich.

193
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:38,739

Huh?
Jerry is cute.

200

He's a senior V.P.

201
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:01,579
He kite-surfs
in Costa Rica every winter,

202
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,648
and he loves his mother.
Seasonally?

203

204

Is this about House?

205

What?

206
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:11,105
Like I secretly wish
I could alter

207
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:13,324
the laws of the universe,
change who we are,

208
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:14,942

make it work out?

209
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,827
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm asking.

210
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:18,079
My sarcasm indicated no.

211
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:19,530
No, your sarcasm indicated

212
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:22,983
you wanted to avoid
actually saying anything.

213
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:24,802
Look, Lisa...

214
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:29,457
All I know
is you seem stuck.

215
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:31,208
And I don't like seeing you
like that.

216
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:35,813
She got worse
in the hyperbaric chamber.

217
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,298
It's not C.O. poisoning.

218
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:38,482
I think
we should consider infection

219
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,967
and test the assistant.

220
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:41,619
I couldn't get his attention.
He was in a daze.

221
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:43,670
- You think that's a symptom?
- He's in love with her.

222
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:46,073
He was probably overwhelmed,
couldn't decide what to do.

223
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,809
What's he been doing
since she was admitted?

224
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:50,411
Did he bring anything

225
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,163
from the patient room
to the treatment room?

226
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,197
A few things--
a handbag,

227
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:55,466
flowers,
stuffed elephant.

228
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:59,737
Does she seem
like the kind of woman

229
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:02,490
who needs a stuffed animal?

230
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,827
Who are you calling?

231
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:08,662
Oh, of course.

232
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:13,100

233
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:15,970
Oh, I can see
what you're wearing.

234
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:18,389
Go to her room.

235
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:31,402
<i>Now go address</i>
<i>the elephant in the room.</i>

236
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,232

245

247

<i>Well, then I guess as long</i>

249
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:13,119
as long as the exploitation
is properly motivated,

250
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:14,587

You think she's scared
of a little arrhythmia?

263
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,209

huffed paint thinner.

If she wanted to be dead,

286
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:18,151
You volunteered because

The patient is a fraud.

351
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,088
I found a puncture in the
dorsal vein of her left foot.

352
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:44,123
- Shooting up heroin wouldn't explain--
- <i>not heroin.</i>

353
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:46,109
She was injecting herself
with her own red blood cells.

354
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:48,611
It caused her heart issues, and
when her hematocrit evened out,

355
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,996
we mistook it
for internal bleeding.

356
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:51,965
It must have been
a very distinctively shaped

357
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:54,968
and awfully talkative puncture
for you to get all of that.

358
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:57,337
Browser history
on her laptop helped.

359
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:59,722
She was researching
blood doping

360
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:03,209
<i>among other things.</i>

361
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:08,014
- She was researching me?
- <i>For months.</i>

362
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:09,565
This isn't about creating art
in the moment.

363
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,234
It's about you.

364
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:13,853
She set you up.

365
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:29,712
We sent a Uni over to
his apartment and the hospital.

366
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:31,554
Yeah, he won't be there.

367
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:34,390
Any ideas?

368
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:36,025
When you find him,
you're gonna arrest him?

369
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:40,897
Is there some reason
you think I shouldn't?

370
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:43,432
Knowing him,
he'll be in a bar.

371
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:46,619
He'll find one that matches
how he feels inside.

372
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:49,539
<i>It'll be the most dark,</i>

373
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:52,408
depressing hole
you can find in New Jersey.

374
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:58,781
Now you're just
pissing me off.

375
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:00,800
<i>I'm really sorry. I-I didn't</i>
<i>know she researched you.</i>

376
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:02,185
I had no idea she--

377
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:04,387
If you don't know anything,
then why are you talking?

378
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:05,788
<i>Please don't take</i>
<i>it out on Luca.</i>

379
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,123
I'll take it out
on whoever I think

380
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:08,658
will irritate you the most.

381
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:10,576
I thought you would understand
someone who uses their work

382
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:11,978
to deal with pain.

383
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:13,346
I didn't realize
that search engines

384
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,814
could look within the soul.

385
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:16,666
You're standing in front of me
in a hospital gown.

386
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:17,817
What the hell
was the point of this?

387
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:20,136
What personal trauma
are you exploiting--

388
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:23,106
Sorry--mining
for its artistic potential?

389
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:25,158
My illness.

390
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:29,612
I did the blood doping
to intrigue you,

391
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:32,615
but I was already ill.

392
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,833
Wait.
You're really sick?

393
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,819
Why me?

394
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,787
<i>Do you know what you have?</i>
Yes.

395
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:39,205
So tell him.

396
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,024
If I do, there won't be
any game for him,

397
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:43,325
and then there won't be
any art for us.

398
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:46,996
Why me?

399
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:49,549
I don't answer
those questions.

400
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:53,436
You know,
there's a lot of games

401
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:55,271
I could play
that don't involve dealing

402
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:57,306
with narcissistic,
manipulative poseurs.

403
00:18:57,358 --> 00:19:00,877
But this is a puzzle
tailor-made for you.

404
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:04,013
<i>You don't know which</i>
<i>of my symptoms are real,</i>

405
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:05,398
which are fake,

406
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,950
which ones I'm not even
telling you about.

407
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:12,572
<i>I know that</i>
<i>intrigues you.</i>

408
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:17,493
Do you really want
to end it now?

409
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:23,449
No.

410
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:25,418
You want us to waste a bed
on her?

411
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:26,753
You took an oath...

412
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:29,255
An oath to be cool.

413
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,108
At least that was the one
I mumbled under my breath

414
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:33,593
while everyone else
was doing the boring one.

415
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:36,262
Even if she is sick,
which I don't believe,

416
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,131
<i>she also says</i>
<i>she has a diagnosis.</i>

417
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:41,184
So it's either just a lie,
or it's just a game.

418
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,602
So what?

419
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:45,321
I like the game. It's fun.
Go get a blood culture.

420
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:47,790
Check for parasites and bacteria.
<i>This is the new House--</i>

421
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:50,660
half the leg power,
twice the irresponsibility?

422
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:52,945
The new House is about making
my life healthier.

423
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,464
Never said anything
about yours.

424
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:56,349
Go get her blood.

425
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:02,738
I'll do it.

426
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,574
He's going through
a tough patch right now.

427
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:06,976
<i>If this is the distraction</i>
<i>he needs</i>

428
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,428
<i>to keep him</i>
<i>in his hospital bed,</i>

429
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:11,047
I'm sure it's better
than any of the alternatives.

430
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:13,966
That was incredibly
condescending.

431
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:15,218
Did it work?

432
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:25,394
♪ If you like piña coladas ♪

433
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:29,098
Why do you keep ducking
your wife's calls?

434
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,299
Ex-wife.

435
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:32,085
I'm sure she just wants
to congratulate you

436
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:34,871
about knocking up
a 22-year-old nurse.

437
00:20:34,938 --> 00:20:37,323
I haven't told her yet.

438
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:39,959
But you have told her
you're not gonna sleep

439
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:42,628
with her anymore, right?

440
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:45,298
How are you planning
on letting her know?

441
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:47,616
Just invite her
to the bris?

442
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,669
I'm trying
to let her down easy.

443
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:51,037
Rachel never wanted
to have kids.

444
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:52,588
I don't want
to hurt her feelings.

445
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,957
Yeah.
You are all about feelings.

446
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:57,727
I've loved Rachel
for 20 years.

447
00:20:57,794 --> 00:21:00,146
What if she never speaks
to me again?

448
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,882
She's gonna find out.

449
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,817
It better be from you.

450
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:07,436
You can't cheat your way
out of this one.

451
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:14,327
What is it?

452
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,913
Oh, just the nausea.

453
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,531
She said her back
was hurting earlier.

454
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:20,500
What's the pain level
on a scale of one to ten?

455
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:21,951
Five.

456
00:21:22,002 --> 00:21:23,819
How do we know
we can take her word for it?

457
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:24,820
We can't.
Fun, huh?

458
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:26,272
Roll on your side.

459
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:32,328
Grey Turner's sign.

460
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:33,996
We're done playing.

461
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:36,098
<i>Your pancreas is releasing</i>
<i>corrosive enzymes.</i>

462
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,850
It'll eat away
at the surrounding organs.

463
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:40,086
<i>But you must know that.</i>

464
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:42,522
The doctor who diagnosed you
would have said what will happen

465
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:44,440
<i>if you don't get treatment.</i>

466
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:47,693
Just tell them.

467
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:49,445
If you know
what's wrong with you,

468
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:51,030
tell them
so they can fix it.

469
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:53,616
How many projects
have we done together?

470
00:21:53,683 --> 00:21:55,484
<i>You're always so worried.</i>

471
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:57,587
Have you ever gone wrong
trusting me?

472
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:09,799
That pancreatic cyst
we drained--

473
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:12,418
it's back,
and she doesn't care at all.

474
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:16,672
You think
she actually is suicidal.

475
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:18,758
I would, but how did
she give herself the cysts?

476
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:20,493
Tox screen was negative,

477
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,345
and there's no sign
of trauma.

478
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,384
<i>There is</i>
<i>another explanation.</i>

479
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:30,169
The reason
she didn't react

480
00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:33,172
isn't 'cause
she wants to die.

481
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,109
It's 'cause she knows
she can't do anything about it.

482
00:22:37,194 --> 00:22:41,264
Whatever she has is fatal.

483
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:44,900
That should narrow it down.

484
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:49,053
What are we doing here?

485
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:51,104
Testing a theory.

486
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:53,958
It's based on some stuff
you can't understand,

487
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:55,559
<i>like RR variability,</i>

488
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:57,528
<i>and some stuff you can,</i>

489
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,597
like the fact that she shaved
her head in an art piece

490
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:00,865
four months ago.

491
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:03,283
That was a commentary
on society's--

492
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:04,802
It was a commentary
on the fact

493
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,387
that it was gonna fall out
anyway,

494
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:08,923
<i>and she wanted</i>
<i>to hide why.</i>

495
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,743
Cancer?

496
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:15,312
Are--are you sure about that?

497
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:20,768
See that tumor-ish thingamajig
near her "brainamabob"?

498
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:23,237
Oh, God.

499
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:25,940
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

500
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:27,158
Game's over.
I won.

501
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,193
<i>Primary CNS lymphoma</i>

502
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:31,028
with associated
paraneoplastic syndrome.

503
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:34,081
Is that really what it is?

504
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:37,651
Yes.

505
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:40,287
<i>Four months ago,</i>

506
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:44,175
<i>I had some vision</i>
<i>and balance problems,</i>

507
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:45,960
<i>and New York Mercy</i>
<i>diagnosed me.</i>

508
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:49,129
The tumor was too close
to the brain stem to cut out,

509
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:52,149
<i>so they did a few rounds</i>
<i>of radiation.</i>

510
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:54,852
<i>But it didn't work,</i>
<i>and they sent me home.</i>

511
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,854
That was around the time
you broke up with me.

512
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,355
We were having a fling.

513
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,558
<i>It wouldn't have been fair</i>
<i>to involve you.</i>

514
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:02,193
I'm involved now.

515
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,745
You just didn't want
to open up.

516
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,881
Luca, my mind
was not clear then.

517
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:10,751
And then you cleared it.

518
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:12,870
Then you realized
you could use your death

519
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:14,572
to make your magnum opus.

520
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,958
<i>Maybe you wanted to show</i>
<i>that no one can cheat death,</i>

521
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:21,345
even an entire team of doctors
with unlimited resources.

522
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:23,998
<i>Or maybe your first doctors</i>

523
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:26,967
didn't treat you like a person--
just a series of symptoms.

524
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:29,553
You wanted to re-create
that depersonalization.

525
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:31,055
And I was the man to see.

526
00:24:33,842 --> 00:24:36,427
If that was what I thought,

527
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:38,896
I don't any longer.

528
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,932
<i>You spent time with me.</i>

529
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:45,436
You took this personally.

530
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:49,173
No, I didn't.

531
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:53,727
<i>And I don't actually think</i>
<i>your piece is about anything.</i>

532
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:55,963
I think you just figured out
that you're mortal.

533
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:58,415
You're just a bag of cells
and waste

534
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,167
with an expiration date.

535
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:03,370
You wanted to act out.
You wanted people to notice.

536
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:09,877
Maybe you even prayed for
a different answer this time.

537
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,519
I got a title
for your piece--

538
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:21,839
"It Doesn't Mean Anything."

539
00:25:33,904 --> 00:25:36,605
You're forging my name
on prescriptions again.

540
00:25:36,673 --> 00:25:38,958
No.

541
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:42,628
What you just said implies
that I stopped at some point.

542
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:44,046
20 minutes ago,
I put a notice out

543
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,281
to all local pharmacies
to require verbal authorization

544
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,134
before filling
my prescriptions.

545
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:50,269
You have any idea how much extra
work you've just given yourself?

546
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:51,504
You're not gonna
last a week.

547
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:53,105
I've been dealing
with this for years.

548
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:54,456
But it's over--

549
00:25:54,508 --> 00:25:57,009
your liver,
your hearing,

550
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:58,811
never mind the fact
that each scrip you write

551
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:00,146
<i>is a separate felony.</i>

552
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,897
You will serve time,
so could I.

553
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:03,265
You've chosen this moment

554
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,984
<i>to give me crap</i>
<i>about my Vicodin use?</i>

555
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,635
You filled this
three days ago.

556
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:07,686
Now it's almost half gone.

557
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:08,804
So is my leg.

558
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,773
It's a month supply.

559
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:12,908
The amount you're taking
has nothing to do

560
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:14,660
with physical pain.
Okay.

561
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:18,080
So maybe I am trying to numb
myself a little,

562
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:20,900
because I'm trying
to change,

563
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:22,259
trying to stop
being self-destructive.

564
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:24,586
So you can only handle
not self-destructing

565
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,538
by being self-destructive?

566
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:27,474
What do you want from me?

567
00:26:27,475 --> 00:26:30,208
I don't know, House,
but I'm worried about you.

568
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:31,793
I don't know how many times
I can watch you

569
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:33,378
cut off pieces of yourself.

570
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:35,363
Now it's the I.C.U.
Next time it'll be the morgue.

571
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:37,949
You're miserable.

572
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:39,501
And you're angry.

573
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:42,754
And I want you
to actually deal with that

574
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:45,957
and not just try to medicate
the issue away.

575
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:50,345
No.

576
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:52,497
You know
what I feel right now?

577
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:55,350
I don't feel miserable
or angry.

578
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:58,019
I don't feel good
or bad.

579
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:01,623
I feel nothing...

580
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:05,193
Which feels great.

581
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:06,611
What are you doing?

582
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:07,836
Moving on.

583
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:11,082
In the direction of my house,
where I got some more pills.

584
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:17,455
If you're discharging yourself
against doctor's orders,

585
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:18,990
you've got to check
that box.

586
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,475
I'm a doctor.

587
00:27:20,543 --> 00:27:22,177
So, technically--

588
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:24,546
Wouldn't it be easier
if you just checked the box?

589
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,785
Why are you still here?

590
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:48,536
I'm going as soon
as the nurse brings me

591
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:50,288
something for my eczema.

592
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,164
I figured it was irritated
by the paint thinner

593
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:00,382
poured on me
in the gallery.

594
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:02,100
Does this mean something?

595
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:04,419
It's not eczema.

596
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:08,840
And it's not cancer.

597
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:13,228
It's Wegener's granulomatosis.

598
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:15,313
Biopsy confirmed
that what you thought was eczema

599
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,015
was actually a swelling
of the blood vessels

600
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:18,566
in your skin.

601
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:20,769
<i>It also explains</i>
<i>the pancreatitis</i>

602
00:28:20,853 --> 00:28:22,937
<i>and the mass in your brain.</i>

603
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:25,907
<i>And it's treatable.</i>

604
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,109
Um...

605
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:30,578
<i>What's the treatment?</i>

606
00:28:30,663 --> 00:28:31,863
We could do steroids alone

607
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:33,415
to shrink the growth
in your brain,

608
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:35,900
but it's much better to add
another course of radiation.

609
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:37,535
Radiation?

610
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:40,472
On my brain?

611
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:42,090
But it made me fuzzy
last time.

612
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:44,008
It was harder to work.

613
00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:46,227
I am still slowed down
from it.

614
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:49,497
And it'll get worse.

615
00:28:49,565 --> 00:28:52,267
But, you know,
dying can also do a number

616
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:53,601
on your ability to think.

617
00:28:56,722 --> 00:28:58,857
I'm sorry.
I can't do the radiation.

618
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:06,915
They just said
it was a better treatment.

619
00:29:06,982 --> 00:29:10,118
It could save your life.

620
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:13,705
My life's not worth anything
if I can't do my art.

621
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:16,074
<i>You have friends,</i>

622
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:19,577
people who care
about you.

623
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:22,914
This is my brain,
my work,

624
00:29:22,965 --> 00:29:24,582
and my life, Luca.

625
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,701
You have more.

626
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:28,686
This is not

627
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:32,307
some great performance
piece anymore.

628
00:29:34,176 --> 00:29:36,578
This is just crazy.

629
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,982
I'm sorry.

630
00:29:45,938 --> 00:29:50,141
I can't watch you die...

631
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:52,827
Not when you
can save yourself.

632
00:29:55,164 --> 00:29:58,449
Good-bye, Afsoun.

633
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:13,882
Good for you.

634
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:29,382
- So.
- So.

635
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:35,605
Why did I ever ban alcohol
from the cafeteria?

636
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,778
Before I forget,
there's a brush.

637
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:44,063
Tortoise-shell handle,
natural bristles--

638
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:46,116
wasn't in the box.

639
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,900
If you could look for it...

640
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:51,538
Like the Lindbergh baby.

641
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,240
You dating anyone?

642
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:55,425
We don't have to--

643
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:58,745
Look, it's just
standard lunch conversation.

644
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:01,348
Not for us.

645
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,016
Okay, well,
if you've gone over

646
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,101
to the "we don't talk
about things" side,

647
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:07,103
then I've got a pot roast
in the oven.

648
00:31:07,188 --> 00:31:09,139
No.

649
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:11,374
I haven't dated anyone
since you.

650
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:17,096
Well, you know what they say--
once you go gimp...

651
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:23,102
We s-should talk
about your leg.

652
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:25,905
You think I have
unresolved issues,

653
00:31:25,957 --> 00:31:27,907
and you are
the unresolved issues.

654
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:30,109
Yes.

655
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:33,079
But it's--it's--
I think it's more than that.

656
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,831
It's your life,
your choices.

657
00:31:34,915 --> 00:31:36,633
I did it
to fix my life.

658
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:38,652
No, wait.

659
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:42,922
No, I did it because
I'm a deeply unhappy person.

660
00:31:42,974 --> 00:31:45,725
No--no, I did it
to get sympathy from you.

661
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:47,577
I did it to piss you off.

662
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:49,262
I did it
because I'm not over you.

663
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:51,481
Or I was over you,
and I was moving on.

664
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:53,633
I did it because I wanted
to know what it's like

665
00:31:53,684 --> 00:31:54,985
not to be in pain.

666
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:59,272
I did it because I want
to feel more pain.

667
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:07,364
Whatever the reason, it was
a bad reason and a bad idea.

668
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:09,165
That's all that matters.

669
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,317
Good lunch.

670
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:18,758
House...

671
00:32:18,826 --> 00:32:20,093
Talk to me!

672
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,177
I already did.

673
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:23,046
No, you just parroted back

674
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,997
what Wilson and I've been saying
to you the last few days.

675
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,883
- Get out of my way.
- No.

676
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:29,052
Oh, you pulled a stitch.

677
00:32:29,136 --> 00:32:30,336
House, please
just talk to me.

678
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:32,939
You want to know
how I feel?

679
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:41,731
I feel hurt.

680
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:53,192
I know.

681
00:32:57,915 --> 00:33:00,500
I'm sorry.

682
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:07,340
It's not your fault.

683
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:23,640
Did I make
the wrong choice?

684
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:29,295
Five years,

685
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:32,365
through every opening,
every installation,

686
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,867
<i>every day</i>
<i>and every night,</i>

687
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:36,286
he was there the whole time.

688
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:39,739
Except the first time
you were diagnosed.

689
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,991
You broke up with him,

690
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:45,428
and you had to go
through all of that alone.

691
00:33:45,513 --> 00:33:49,599
Maybe that's the real reason
you're doing this piece--

692
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:53,736
so that this time
you can have him with you.

693
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:56,289
<i>You still could.</i>

694
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:10,036
Hi.

695
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:11,788
Uh, Lisa Cuddy.

696
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:13,089
Nice to meet you.

697
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:14,624
I'm sorry
about the other day.

698
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:17,660
I--there were some personal
things going on in my life,

699
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:20,096
and I wasn't at my best.

700
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:22,298
Well, in retrospect,

701
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:24,918
my approach could've come off
as a little creepy.

702
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:26,619
No.

703
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,222
On a scale from one
to creepy,

704
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:31,357
you were
maybe mildly unnerving.

705
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:36,846
<i>Paging Dr. Stateman.</i>

706
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:38,181
<i>Dr. Stateman, please.</i>

707
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:47,607
Rache.

708
00:34:47,658 --> 00:34:49,576
Sorry I ducked your calls.

709
00:34:49,643 --> 00:34:52,412
I keep making the same mistakes,
but at some point--

710
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,647
Chris...
I'm pregnant.

711
00:34:59,153 --> 00:35:01,504
I...

712
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:04,707
didn't expect that.

713
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:11,998
Sorry.

714
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:13,800
Just checking the stitches
on my penis.

715
00:35:13,851 --> 00:35:16,335
Your leg okay?

716
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:18,188
- It's healing.
- Good.

717
00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:20,339
Just came to grab
the radiation-therapy forms.

718
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:22,108
What?

719
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:25,345
Afsoun changed her mind.

720
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:31,701
Get out.

721
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:41,544
You made a decision.

722
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:44,380
- I changed my mind.
- <i>Why?</i>

723
00:35:44,465 --> 00:35:47,033
Because there
are more important things than--

724
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:48,418
Than what--
than your brain,

725
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:50,470
your abilities?

726
00:35:50,537 --> 00:35:52,255
It's where
everything comes from--

727
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:54,140
any meaning in your life,
any happiness.

728
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,675
Not all happiness--

729
00:35:55,726 --> 00:35:58,144
He's already left once.
He's gonna leave you again.

730
00:35:58,211 --> 00:35:59,646
You don't need to depend
on people

731
00:35:59,713 --> 00:36:02,932
who are gonna let you down.

732
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:06,236
If you do this,
you're a pathetic hypocrite.

733
00:36:06,303 --> 00:36:08,521
You're saying that
your whole life, all your work

734
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:10,507
up until him was a pointless--
Why are you doing this?

735
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:07,766
<i>House I can hear</i>
<i>your phone ringing.</i>

736
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:30,231
You alright?

737
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,741
You had lunch with Cuddy?

738
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,252
Yeah.

739
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:35,911
How was it?

740
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,512
The pasta arrabbiata
was cold.

741
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,893
Why don't we get a drink?

742
00:37:44,983 --> 00:37:47,852
We could go
to the Sawmill.

743
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:05,703
Cuddy's is on the way.

744
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,106
I need to return this.

745
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:12,043
You think she's going to have
an emergency tangle?

746
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,378
It was on my mind.

747
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:16,163
I want to get it off.

748
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:26,474
Want me to come?

749
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:29,143
If I get in trouble?

750
00:38:29,144 --> 00:38:31,562
I'm delivering a hair brush.

751
00:39:36,712 --> 00:39:38,028
What just happened?

752
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,132
Get out.

753
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:43,867
What just happened?

754
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,436
Get out.

755
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:57,181
House,
what are you mad about?

756
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:39,807
Aah!

757
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,782
You're right.
I feel much better.

758
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,600
You want another one?

759
00:41:58,836 --> 00:42:02,273
No, I think
I've had enough.

760
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,175
What do you think
I should do today?

761
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:07,044
I don't know.
Go home?

762
00:42:10,232 --> 00:42:12,700
Not tonight.

763
00:42:12,784 --> 00:42:14,618
