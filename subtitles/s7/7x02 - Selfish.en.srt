00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:45,453
It's a sexual
relationship.

177
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:49,324
Go slowly now.

178
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:50,692
He's writing it down.

179
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,461
I believe
that I can still

180
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:55,546
supervise Dr. House
effectively,

181
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:57,265
but we both want
to follow hospital policy

182
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:58,383
to the letter.

183
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:00,084
Our concern
is to make sure

184
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:02,070
that there's no
conflict of interest,

185
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,439
no liability
for the hospital.

186
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,341
You think we're gonna sue
if things go South?

187
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,109
Let me tell you.
She actually does go--

188
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,144
House.

189
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:12,196
Let him talk.

190
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:15,300
<i>I, uh, know that</i>
<i>you're not going to sue,</i>

191
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:19,937
because you are both
going to sign love contracts.

192
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:21,772
Consensual relationship
agreements.

193
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:23,808
Well, obviously
outside council

194
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:28,863
will have to review
the crotchless undies clause.

195
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:30,949
Uh, we'll also need to watch

196
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:33,635
for any favoritism
toward Dr. House.

197
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,386
Does that mean she has
to sleep with everyone?

198
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:37,255
I promise not to give him
a raise or a promotion

199
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:38,506
of any kind.

200
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,623
There's got to be
a joke there

201
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:41,092
about keeping up
with inflation.

202
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:45,063
Or bias against him.

203
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,599
Are there any
supervisory issues

204
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:49,901
with Dr. House's
current case load?

205
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:51,302
No, her case is solved.

206
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:53,104
Patient has Long QT.

207
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:54,989
Gonna scare her into
cardiac arrest to confirm it.

208
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,157
No, we're not.

209
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:58,943
Okay, no, we're not.

210
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:03,314
See?
Everything's under control.

211
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,867
I know you're still planning
your ridiculous scare test.

212
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,985
The patient is nowhere
near sick enough

213
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:09,754
to justify the risk.

214
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,673
An angiogram
and an E.P. study

215
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:14,342
are much safer
and very effective.

216
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:17,345
Fair point.
Not doing the scare test.

217
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,967
I'd invite you to watch me
not doing the test,

218
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:24,802
but having not done it
many times before,

219
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:27,338
trust me, it's pretty
not interesting.

220
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:34,979
[Phone beeps, dials]

221
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:35,897
<i>(Taub)</i>
<i>House?</i>

222
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:37,065
Scare test
was not approved.

223
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:39,017
Do an angio and
E.P. study instead.

224
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:41,185
<i>First of all, that's not</i>
<i>as effective as--</i>

225
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,708
how come you're not doing
the more specialized test?

226
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,327
This test is virtually
just as effective.

227
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,963
And Dr. House puts
a premium on patient safety.

228
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,364
But frequently
changes his mind.

229
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:56,417
Hugo, give him a break.
I'm fine.

230
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:57,719
<i>You should go to the bathroom</i>
<i>before we go.</i>

231
00:10:57,803 --> 00:10:59,637
We've been hydrating you
for quite a while.

232
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:00,722
I don't have to pee.

233
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:02,390
Once we start the test,

234
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:04,208
you won't be able to move
for at least an hour.

235
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:06,177
I really don't have to pee.

236
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:08,312
How much fluid
have we given her?

237
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:11,449
2.5 liters.

238
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,151
When's the last time
you went to the bathroom?

239
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:15,386
Last night, I guess.

240
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:16,671
<i>What does that mean?</i>

241
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:19,424
Your daughter's kidneys
seem to be failing.

242
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,998
So what could cause
her heart to stop

243
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,066
and her urine not to drop?

244
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:31,721
House, I was expecting
your relationship with Cuddy

245
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,988
to complicate our work
long-term.

246
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,791
I am now concerned it might
be affecting us short-term.

247
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:38,126
All due respect.

248
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:39,661
None taken.

249
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:41,563
I listen to Cuddy
all the time.

250
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,015
She's my boss.
Also yours, by the way.

251
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,550
You'd listen, then tell her
she's being an idiot,

252
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,001
and do whatever you want.

253
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:48,186
I find I can skip
the idiot part

254
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,471
when she's not
being an idiot,

255
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:50,755
<i>and since the scare test</i>

256
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,157
<i>would have led</i>
<i>to the same dead end,</i>

257
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:53,558
she was right to stop it.

258
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:55,894
Which means
your problem's about you.

259
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,362
This should be interesting.

260
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:59,063
Losers love company.

261
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:01,399
And if even
a misanthrope like me

262
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:02,901
has a chance at happiness,

263
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:04,486
it's gonna be pretty lonely

264
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:06,337
on that landfill
of loserdom

265
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:08,439
you call a mriage.

266
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:09,941
Heart, kidneys, go.

267
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:11,843
Could be fabry disease.

268
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:13,545
Lipid deposition
in her tissues.

269
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:14,829
Dad's history was clean.

270
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:15,980
<i>What about</i>
<i>protein deposits?</i>

271
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:18,149
They wouldn't show
in her parents' history.

272
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,134
Amyloidosis.

273
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:22,170
Explains both
the symptoms.

274
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:23,371
Marrow transplant
to treat.

275
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:24,872
Brother's a match.

276
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:27,542
Confirm and do.

277
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,329
I been
experiencing fatigue,

278
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,932
and--and weakness.

279
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,600
Wouldn't have anything
to do with the fact

280
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:39,137
that you're...
102 years old.

281
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:40,688
Usually
he's strong as an ox.

282
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,524
102-year-old ox.

283
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:45,026
He has tingling
in his feet and his legs.

284
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:47,328
I want a full battery
of tests.

285
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:48,646
Carbon dating?

286
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:51,065
I'll pay cash
if it's not covered.

287
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:52,567
That's nice of you
to float your friend.

288
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:54,786
He's not my friend.
He's my father.

289
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,672
He's 22 years
older than me.

290
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,792
Well, that's true, he's
definitely had his jowls done.

291
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,294
Statistically, if he didn't
have these symptoms,

292
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,179
he'd be like most
people of his age--

293
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:06,914
dead for the past
several decades.

294
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:08,550
Do the tests.
I'm sick.

295
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,935
You have a bad case
of natural causes.

296
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:15,256
Do the damn tests.

297
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:16,975
If the vial
fills with sand,

298
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,261
we take that as a bad sign.

299
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:21,329
Hugo should be here.

300
00:13:21,397 --> 00:13:22,513
Why'd you ask him to leave?

301
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:24,599
We wanted to be able
to discuss this openly.

302
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,601
But it obviously affects him.

303
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:27,952
Honey,
let the doctor finish.

304
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,437
<i>It's a standard procedure.</i>

305
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:30,605
We use general anesthesia,

306
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,090
harvest a very small
amount of--

307
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:34,626
no. I'm not taking
my brother's marrow.

308
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,776
Del, it's--

309
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:36,961
<i>these harvests</i>
<i>are harmless.</i>

310
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,079
With the meds we give,

311
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:39,581
there's almost no pain,

312
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:40,632
almost no risk of infection.

313
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:42,800
Almost?

314
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:47,205
His life's hard enough
as it is.

315
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,173
<i>(Taub)</i>
<i>Small problem</i>
<i>with the treatment.</i>

316
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:52,393
Patient won't take marrow
from steel wheels?

317
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,928
We're finding
another match.

318
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,096
And how do you know?

319
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:56,964
What other problem
could there be

320
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,633
with a problem-free
procedure?

321
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,852
Boy's sports,
science club,

322
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:03,137
she's living his life,
not hers.

323
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,156
Makes sense she's being
a self-denying moron.

324
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
She loves her brother.

325
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:07,442
She's thinking
selflessly.

326
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:08,476
How is that at all--

327
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:09,494
being moronic?

328
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:10,811
Mm.
If I can only think

329
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:11,979
of a harm-free
medical treatment

330
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:12,964
she turned down lately.

331
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:14,032
You're right.

332
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,199
If everyone
were more selfish,

333
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:16,618
the world would be
a better place.

334
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:19,120
See? I can skip
the idiot part

335
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:22,340
when you're not
being an idiot.

336
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:24,676
Yeah, I had that
same facial expression

337
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,010
for the first 48 hours.

338
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,295
Had another one too,

339
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:29,681
but only for
15 seconds at a time.

340
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:31,182
I'm happy for you.
You're happy for you.

341
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,167
This is huge.

342
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:35,269
So who's gonna
supervise you?

343
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:36,888
Cuddy.

344
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:39,557
Well, I guess
maybe that can work.

345
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:42,026
Maybe?
Nothing's changed.

346
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:45,229
You showed up for clinic hours.
Voluntarily.

347
00:14:45,314 --> 00:14:47,532
Fine.
A little bit has changed.

348
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:48,650
House,
everything's changed.

349
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:49,850
You're sleeping together.

350
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:51,319
You want something from her

351
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,188
besides a sign-off on scaring

If that fails, we'll switch her
to broad-spectrum antibiotics

530
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,743
and hope we're not
too late.

531
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:38,748
Cat got your legs?

532
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>We just decided</i>
<i>to give meds</i>

533
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:42,886
that could kill the patient
based on a guess.

534
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,838
You need approval from Cuddy,

535
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:46,556
and she'll want to take
the safer course,

536
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,208
and you're gonna fold
like an origami crane, so...

537
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,212
I'll just wait here
till we get our actual orders.

538
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:54,714
Fine. You do it.

539
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:57,200
<i>Tell her</i>
<i>she's being an idiot</i>

540
00:22:57,268 --> 00:22:59,536
for always choosing
the safer course.

541
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:02,772
She's sitting on her ample,
if well-formed, bureaucratic ass

542
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:04,190
while our patient's dying.

543
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:06,326
We'll see who folds
like an origami shrimp.

544
00:23:06,393 --> 00:23:09,078
You want <i>me</i> to get
Cuddy's approval?

545
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:10,413
I gotta be somewhere
important.

546
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:11,814
Sitting at your desk?

547
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:13,499
I'm running late.

548
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:32,552
Forget the tests.

549
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,272
I think junior might have
a few words to say about that.

550
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:40,092
I love him,
but he can't let go.

551
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:42,528
40 bucks says he can.

552
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:45,198
I can't do anything
without him helping me

553
00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:47,200
like I'm senile.

554
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:49,769
If I go back there,
I'm gonna rip his throat out.

555
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:51,871
You sure you won't warm up
to him over time?

556
00:23:57,795 --> 00:23:58,912
Skip the blood work.

557
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:01,798
Tell my son it's grim news.

558
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:04,116
I need to be
in a nursing home.

559
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:07,119
A private room.

560
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:08,605
Make it a suite.

561
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:10,390
Be our little secret.

562
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:16,896
I sit around
on my bureaucratic ass?

563
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:18,464
I was relaying
your words.

564
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,833
I said well-formed.
I said well-formed!

565
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:22,719
What were you--

566
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:24,887
I needed to be aggressive.
You're an idiot.

567
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:27,857
She was siding
with Foreman's analysis.

568
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,159
The odds are against it
being hyperacute rejection.

569
00:24:30,244 --> 00:24:32,161
Stop.

570
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:33,696
I agree with you.

571
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,882
<i>That was our analysis</i>
<i>from the start.</i>

572
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,117
If you've got a problem
with a team decision,

573
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:40,119
you come to me.

574
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,455
I'm sorry.
I-I'll deal with him later.

575
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,526
I said well-formed.

576
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:55,652
<i>People who have not</i>
<i>seen Cuddy naked</i>

577
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,770
should not throw stones.

578
00:24:57,838 --> 00:25:00,640
<i>She does have</i>
<i>great cans.</i>

579
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:04,176
Cuddy has House
on such a short leash,

580
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:06,012
she might as well start
giving him chew toys.

581
00:25:06,063 --> 00:25:08,731
Let's give the antibiotics
at least another hour.

582
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:11,401
Amazing. And House hasn't
given you one ounce of grief

583
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:14,153
for your complete lack
of interest in his love life?

584
00:25:14,204 --> 00:25:16,489
Did it ever occur to you
that House is just happy

585
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,357
and could give a crap
about other people's lives

586
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:19,542
because of it?

587
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:22,194
Well, that's ironic
and depressing.

588
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:23,713
And by that logic,

589
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:25,381
the reason
you don't give a crap

590
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:27,000
is because you're happy,

591
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,035
which means
you've got someone new

592
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:30,970
giving you chew toys.

593
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:32,371
You're 1/4th right.

594
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:33,873
Wait.

595
00:25:33,924 --> 00:25:36,225
Are you saying...
[pagers beep]

596
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,977
You're dating
four women?

597
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:45,318
<i>(Chase)</i>
<i>BP's dropping.</i>

598
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:46,903
Means the antibiotics
aren't working.

599
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:49,522
Put her in trendelenburg.
Can you save the lung?

600
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:51,858
Believe it or not,
we got a better chance now.

601
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:53,776
This means rejection,
not infection.

602
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:55,862
Start her on iv
methylprednisolone right away.

603
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:58,114
[Machine beeping]

604
00:26:01,785 --> 00:26:02,869
Wow.

605
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,904
You hate salad.

606
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:07,590
She's really got you
tied up in knots.

607
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:10,043
I caved.
Through an intermediary.

608
00:26:10,094 --> 00:26:12,295
I need a plan "C."

609
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:15,264
What you need is a plan
that you actually develop

610
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:17,717
with Cuddy.

611
00:26:20,137 --> 00:26:22,188
Antibiotics didn't work
and then steroids didn't work.

612
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:23,439
<i>The new lung's ruined,</i>

613
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:25,341
and it's not rejection
or infection.

614
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:26,976
<i>The only two options</i>
<i>were wrong.</i>

615
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:28,478
Unless it's not lam.

616
00:26:28,562 --> 00:26:31,064
It is lam.
The tests were positive.

617
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:33,766
Then the tests
have to be wrong.

618
00:26:33,817 --> 00:26:35,768
Deep-fryer's working again.

619
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:38,371
Still working on that?

620
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:40,289
No, it was here
when I sat down.

621
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:41,374
I need to think.

622
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,072
I want to make sure
you're trying everything

623
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,524
to save my sister.

624
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:16,325
Everything?

625
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:18,945
Well, that must be it.

626
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,164
See, I thought you guys
checked the box marked,

627
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:22,782
"try every other thing."

628
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,251
I'm the one that's
supposed to die first.

629
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:27,653
I'm the damaged one,
not her.

630
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:29,455
She never even gets
a cold.

631
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:31,591
Damage has a way of spreading
to everyone around you.

632
00:27:31,658 --> 00:27:33,759
For example,
your obvious emotional damage

633
00:27:33,827 --> 00:27:36,012
is now making me have
a philosophical conversation

634
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:37,663
instead of dealing with
your sister.

635
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:40,266
See how that might be
damaging?

636
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:50,076
Never?

637
00:27:51,862 --> 00:27:54,063
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>you had a cold?</i>

638
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:56,732
Any minor aches,
swelling, anything?

639
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:00,486
[Mutters]
<i>It's been years.</i>

640
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,822
She never gets colds.

641
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,824
I didn't ask when's
the last time she mentioned it.

642
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,627
I asked when she had one--
even a tiny one.

643
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:09,378
It's nothing.

644
00:28:09,446 --> 00:28:13,166
Sometimes my ears
ache a little.

645
00:28:13,217 --> 00:28:15,384
So now tell me
the rest of the nothing.

646
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:18,254
M-my chest...

647
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:20,339
Soreness.

648
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,091
Some congestion.

649
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,726
You never said anything
about that.

650
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,528
I barely noticed it

651
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:27,430
until that skateboarding
tournament in Denver.

652
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,731
How long ago?

653
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,633
A...Year?

654
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:34,103
Cold's nothing
when I think of

655
00:28:34,188 --> 00:28:36,439
what Hugo
goes through every day.

656
00:28:36,523 --> 00:28:38,390
Yeah, we get it.
Your brother, the Saint.

657
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:40,860
His sister, the martyr.

658
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:46,449
Thank God you followed me.

659
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:48,400
Now you can go back
to the transplant committee

660
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:50,069
while I get confirmation.

661
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,337
Confirmation of what?

662
00:28:51,404 --> 00:28:53,623
What causes low-level
cold symptoms for a year,

663
00:28:53,707 --> 00:28:55,791
can ruin two lungs,
is immune to drug therapies,

664
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:58,427
and gets worse in cities
nicknamed mile-high?

665
00:28:58,512 --> 00:28:59,679
A clotting disorder?

666
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:01,764
She has a nasty case
of sickle cell trait.

667
00:29:01,848 --> 00:29:03,916
Her heart arrhythmia
wasn't sudden at all.

668
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:06,302
Screwed-up blood cells
screwed up the blood vessels

669
00:29:06,386 --> 00:29:09,188
which gave us a screwed-up
positive for lam.

670
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:11,857
If she'd told us about
her symptoms sooner--like ever--

671
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:13,359
she might not be dying.

672
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:14,977
You were right after all.

673
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:16,479
I never said sickle--

674
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:18,147
if everyone
were more selfish,

675
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:20,449
the world would be
a better place.

676
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:23,369
So she's gonna die.

677
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:26,289
Unless we can find--

678
00:29:26,356 --> 00:29:27,990
she burned through
one donor lung.

679
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:31,961
Transplant committee's never
gonna give her a second one.

680
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:34,380
Well, then I guess
you're right again.

681
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:41,220
Unless we don't need
their approval.

682
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:52,068
You can't advise
your patient's parents

683
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:55,655
to take marrow and half a lung
from their son!

684
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:59,192
I guess I can just chat
with them about the weather.

685
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:01,578
Blood tests just confirmed
sickle cell trait.

686
00:30:01,662 --> 00:30:05,832
So they might be curious
about the <i>only</i> treatment option.

687
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,101
Though we are having
weird weather lately.

688
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:10,020
There is a huge reason
not to take lungs

689
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:11,571
from living patients.

690
00:30:11,622 --> 00:30:13,240
So their siblings can die?

691
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:14,908
Their son has cmd.

692
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,894
As it is, he's gonna die
of respiratory failure by 25.

693
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:19,913
We could cut whatever time
he has left in half.

694
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:22,582
That qualifies as a bad reason
for them to reject the idea.

695
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:24,518
It's a much worse reason
for them not to get the choice.

696
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:26,703
It's coercive to tell them!

697
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,305
You ever hear of
"do no harm"?

698
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,106
That was second year, right?

699
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:31,591
'Cause I had mono
all that fall.

700
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:32,926
Their son's
not even our patient.

701
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,277
Why don't we just
take half a lung

702
00:30:34,362 --> 00:30:35,946
from some guy in the clinic
with a toothache?

703

You do so many
great things.

880
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:11,635
I just watch.

881
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:15,739
I get to watch
and coach and cheer.

882
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,274
But that's not me out there.

883
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:21,795
It never will be.

884
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,166
If you take
this piece of me,

885
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,002
carry it with you...

886
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:33,139
Then I really can share
in everything you do.

887
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:36,326
<i>This is the great thing</i>

888
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:40,530
I can do with my life.

889
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,934
Don't make me
live without you.

890
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,664
[All crying]

891
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:19,436
We got lucky.

892
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,644
I did give them
an impossible choice.

893
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:29,846
The kid took it
away from them.

894
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:33,700
That fight...

895
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,019
Was the first
honest interaction

896
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,371
you and I have had
since we came back to work.

897
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,045
If we are painfully,
brutally honest with each other,

898
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,664
maybe we'll get lucky
again.

899
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,302
You've got a big ass.

900
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:55,655
[Elevator Bell dings]
