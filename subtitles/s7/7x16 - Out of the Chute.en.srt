One. Don't tense up now.

18
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:25,614
Go with him.

19
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:33,739
Two. That's it.
Stay in rhythm.

20
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:38,777
Three.
What are you doing, Lane?

21
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:39,828
You're tipping in.

22
00:01:42,883 --> 00:01:44,049
Four.
What's your problem?

23
00:01:44,134 --> 00:01:45,718
Get your ass down.
Get back in the middle.

24
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:50,556
Five. You're weak.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,308
You got all kinds
of daylight under you.

26
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:57,846
Six. Damn, Lane, you should
be schooling this bull.

27
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:04,436
Seven. Get up, set your hips
before the kick comes down.

28
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:09,909
Nice recovery.

29
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,161
Now just wait till he turns
back away from your hand.

30
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:34,767
Whoo!

31
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:24,466
Hey. Hey.

32
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:29,021
What the hell just happened?

33
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:31,357
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

34
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:49,756
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

35
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:12,781
I'm fine.

36
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,317
Okay.

37
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:18,120
I assume Cuddy told you
that she dumped me.

38
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:19,405
She did.

39
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:20,873
And that I'm back on Vicodin.

40
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:24,043
She told me you
had taken <i>a</i> Vicodin.

41
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,045
And then I took <i>a</i> lot more.

42
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,579
And so on.

43
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,333
But you're fine?

44
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,835
Well,
I'm not fine as in "fine,"

45
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:35,421
but I'm fine as in "you don't
have to worry about me."

46
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:37,139
Because you cleared out
your bank account,

47
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:39,374
checked into a hotel,
and started back on Vicodin?

48
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:42,511
Because I'm going to be fine
as in "fine" very soon.

49
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:44,012
Until that happens,

50
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,014
are you sure Vicodin is the...

51
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,182
My leg hurts.

52
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,551
You've been able
to handle the pain.

53
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,652
It's gotten worse.

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,904
Not physically worse.

55
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:53,138
Worse is worse.

56
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:54,389
<i>Pain doesn't discriminate.</i>

57
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,358
Neither do the pills.

58
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,194
The Vicodin
and the five-star pampering

59
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,397
that I'm gonna get
over the next few days

60
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:02,848
should be enough
to get me through it.

61
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,249
<i>So you don't want</i>
<i>to just avoid the issue.</i>

62
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:07,119
You want to avoid
avoiding the issue. Sorry.

63
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:08,620
Nothing is either
as bad or as good

64
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:09,905
as we think it is at the time.

65
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:12,458
That's why T.O. mocks
his opponents immediately

66
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:13,459
<i>after scoring.</i>

67
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:14,793
<i>He doesn't wait</i>

68
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:16,512
till his friend shows up
the next day

69
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,130
<i>to tell him to deal with it.</i>

70
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:19,915
Two weeks from now,

71
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,967
maybe a little more,
maybe a little less,

72
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:25,086
my life will be back to its
usual level of crappiness.

73
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:26,421
Till then, the only real issue

74
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,757
is how much I'm gonna spend
on hotel charges.

75
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:30,425
Good morning, sir.

76
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,945
I've got your deluxe
breakfast for two.

77
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:34,429
Do I have to count
the strawberries?

78
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,531
<i>Don't worry.</i>

79
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,366
You can trust me with anything.

80
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:39,651
Including your food.

81
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:41,770
After he and I have sex,

82
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:42,905
<i>I'm gonna slit his throat</i>

83
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:44,540
and then disembowel him
in the bathtub.

84
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:46,742
Oh, no problem. I'll cancel
the morning maid service.

85
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:48,460
Would you like me
to have them clean up later

86
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:49,945
when they come
to turn down your bed?

87
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:53,114
Why didn't I meet you
six months ago?

88
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,366
Thank you very much.

89
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:55,717
And if there's
anything else I can do

90
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:57,002
to make your stay here
more enjoyable,

91
00:05:57,086 --> 00:06:00,255
just ring the concierge
and ask for Carnell.

92
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,792
Eat fast.

93
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:05,994
We're expecting company.

94
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:07,146
Okay.

95
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,097
This might not be
such a bad idea.

96
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,988
What do you think he meant
by "anything"?

97
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:21,927
Take some time for yourself.
Relax.

98
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,563
I know it's a figure of speech,

99
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:28,417
but he really did seem
to underline the "anything."

100
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:29,818
Maybe talk to someone?

101
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,286
Already scheduled.

102
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:33,789
Really?

103
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:36,341
I'm not an idiot.

104
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:39,011
I know I need help.

105
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:40,629
Okay.

106
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,214
That's...great.

107
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,802
I meant, like, a counselor.

108
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,337
I know.

109
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:50,789
But you meant a hooker.

110
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:52,391
Yeah.

111
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,110
Baby steps.

112
00:06:58,064 --> 00:06:59,114
House screwed us.

113
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,782
<i>Ten years of doctors</i>

114
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,367
cobbling him back together.

115
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,352
Metal rods in every limb.

116
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:05,988
Pins stabilizing his spine.

117
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,239
Five screws

118
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:09,291
and a titanium plate
in his skull.

119
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:10,525
Can't do MRIs.

120
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:12,411
X-rays are probably
gonna be useless as well.

121
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,195
Every piece of metal
is gonna obscure something.

122
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:16,131
And House isn't sick.

123
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:17,833
Why would you say that?

124
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,084
Cuddy dumped House.

125
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:21,003
He's out somewhere
expecting us to indulge him

126
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:23,038
<i>while he ignores his job</i>
<i>and licks his wounds.</i>

127
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,306
Cuddy dumped him?

128
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:26,642
Don't do that.
Don't get sucked in.

129
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,043
He loves her. What?

130
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,394
You can't feel bad for him
for five minutes?

131
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:32,147
I can feel bad for him
while still expecting him

132
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:33,682
to act like an adult,
show up for work,

133
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,000
and not go on a booze-,

134
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:37,385
<i>Vicodin-,</i>
<i>and hooker-filled bender.</i>

135
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,688
Which is why for now we're gonna
handle the case without him.

136
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,240
Oh, is that the reason?

137
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:42,574
<i>I thought it was because</i>
<i>you can't pass up</i>

138
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:43,792
any chance to seize control.

139
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,510
I said "we."
You want "pretty please" too?

140
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:47,246
Wait. I understand the booze

141
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,249
and the hookers,
but why Vicodin?

142
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,001
Wow, you really don't have
any friends in here, do you?

143
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:56,521
House is a Vicodin addict.

144
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:57,956
He's been clean for two years.

145
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,092
He's used here at work?

146
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,593
<i>Yes, that is very troubling.</i>

147
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,695
<i>Almost as much as the fact</i>

148
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:05,063
that our patient
has a ruptured diaphragm,

149
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:06,031
cracked sternum, broken nose,

150
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,432
and partial hearing loss,

151
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:09,968
<i>which can be explained</i>
<i>by a bull jumping on him.</i>

152
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:11,887
And a neurological disorder,
low-grade fever,

153
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:14,356
nausea, and peripheral muscle
weakness that can't.

154
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:16,158
What if the hearing loss
wasn't caused by the bull?

155
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:17,643
That's just when he noticed it?

156
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,195
<i>Inner-ear pathology</i>
<i>can affect the equilibrium</i>

157
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:22,314
and cause disorientation,

158
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:23,932
making it appear to be
a neurological disorder.

159
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,534
So how do we confirm?

160
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,736
CT is just gonna show us
the plate and screws

161
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,270
holding his skull together.

162
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:30,622
We can do calorics and an ENG.

163
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:31,773
<i>If he has inner-ear damage,</i>

164
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:33,158
it'll affect his balance.

165
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:35,127
Sounds good. Go ahead.

166
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,379
Go ahead? Really?

167
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:38,997
What if one of us disagrees?

168
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:45,453
I happen to agree with Foreman.

169
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,339
Go do it.

170
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,625
You knew he was an addict
before you got involved.

171
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:51,643
Didn't end the relationship...

172
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:52,794
You knew he was an ass...

173
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:54,763
I didn't end it...

174
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:56,648
You told him you did not
want him to change.

175
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:57,683
And I was wrong.

176
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,267
You don't know that.

177
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:02,270
<i>You thought you were gonna die.</i>

178
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:03,822
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>that was the right time</i>

179
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,473
<i>to make this kind of decision?</i>

180
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:06,658
No.

181
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:08,410
But I've thought about it.

182
00:09:08,477 --> 00:09:11,980
A lot.

183
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,032
And I haven't changed my mind.

184
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:18,837
He thought you were gonna die.

185
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:23,208
Nobody knows the right way
to react in that situation.

186
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:24,876
Just give him another chance.

187
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,462
He deserves it.

188
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,765
I know.

189
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:35,721
But this isn't about
what he deserves.

190
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:37,005
When things go wrong,

191
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:39,891
I don't want to hope
that I'm not alone.

192
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:41,560
I want to know it.

193
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:43,328
With House...

194
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,666
Every time I needed him
to step up...

195
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,154
He's just never gonna be that.

196
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,688
It's not his fault.
It's who he is.

197
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,991
I should have known it.

198
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,794
This is my fault.

199
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,369
Well, he's back on Vicodin.

200
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:10,889
So you might want to...

201
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:13,759
Keep an eye on his new patient.

202
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:19,731
ENG was normal.

203
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:21,183
Means his inner ear isn't...

204
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:21,967
<i>Morons.</i>

205
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,101
It wasn't...

206
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:24,352
<i>Whoa.</i>
<i>Wait a second.</i>

207
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:25,737
<i>The acoustics in here</i>
<i>are beautiful.</i>

208
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:28,857
<i>Morons!</i>

209
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:30,442
You say it.

210
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:32,160
Morons.

211
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:33,445
Who was that?

212
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,113
<i>Something Carnell got me.</i>

213
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:36,615
It wasn't that ridiculous
of a theory.

214
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:37,549
<i>Great theory.</i>

215
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,534
It's a ridiculous test.

216
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:41,920
You can't give
a standard balance test

217
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:43,789
<i>to a champion bull rider.</i>

218
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:45,006
<i>If you're gonna test</i>
<i>Superman's strength,</i>

219
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:46,908
<i>you need a bigger barbell.</i>

220
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,427
<i>Find one, make him lift it,</i>

221
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:51,379
then call me and tell me
how high it got.

222
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:54,349
And tell Cuddy that spying
is for cowards.

223
00:10:58,387 --> 00:10:59,888
Just keep me posted.

224
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,106
I will.
I will.

225
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,478
You said my inner ear was fine.

226
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:07,946
Previous test
was for regular people.

227
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,614
You were banged up pretty bad
in the accident.

228
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,533
But given your
athletic ability...

229
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,734
Wasn't no accident.

230
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:13,869
That bull had malice
and forethought.

231
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:16,822
Uh, you mean aforethought.

232
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:18,773
Whatever.
He was pissed.

233
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,275
Can you blame him?

234
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:21,443
Not at all.

235
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:23,044
If he don't do
what he gets paid for,

236
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:24,346
I don't get to do
what I get paid for.

237
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:25,347
You ever think of getting paid

238
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:26,414
for doing something else?

239
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:27,899
You're running out
of bones to break.

240
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,385
You ever think of doing
something you don't love?

241
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:31,586
It has its downside,

242
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:33,388
<i>but everything does.</i>

243
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:37,109
There ain't nothing like
those eight seconds.

244
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,626
Traveling around,
getting to meet the fans,

245
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:41,179
that ain't so bad either,
if you know what I mean.

246
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:43,748
All right, now what?

247
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,183
<i>We're gonna start
rocking the platform</i>

248
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:46,518
and changing your visual field

249
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:48,904
while you balance
on just your right leg.

250
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:50,405
Here you go, Lane.

251
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:53,825
I'm gonna start slow.

252
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,243
<i>If you start to experience</i>

253
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:56,745
any nausea or disorientation,

254
00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:58,196
just let us know
and we'll stop the test.

255
00:11:58,281 --> 00:11:59,364
You got it.

256
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:10,292
Ha.

257
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:14,629
That is amazing.

258
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:19,351
We can stop.

259
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:20,769
There's obviously nothing wrong

260
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:22,103
with his inner ear.

261
00:12:25,174 --> 00:12:26,507
Now what?

262
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,561
And I direct that question
not to my boss,

263
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:31,313
but to anyone
who has an answer.

264
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,481
If it's not in his ear,
it's got to be his brain.

265
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:34,783
But if we can't get any images,

266
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,952
then how do we...

267
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,403
Looks like you guys
got some rusty pipes.

268
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,855
This water's brown.

269
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,858
That's not from the pipes.

270
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,244
<i>It's from your mouth.</i>

271
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,134
Can you pass me the, um...

272
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:09,141
What took you so long?

273
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:10,693
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>wrong with his ears,</i>

274
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:11,810
<i>but he's got blood</i>
<i>in his sputum.</i>

275
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:13,529
Doesn't answer the question.

276
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:14,747
<i>We weren't avoiding you.</i>

277
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:16,282
It took us a little time

278
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,584
to think up a diagnostic test
no one's ever thought up before.

279
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:19,785
<i>Apology accepted.</i>

280
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:21,486
It could be a tumor
in a salivary gland.

281
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:22,988
We should get a parotid biopsy.

282
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,707
Oh, that's so cute.

283
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,992
You're fighting over
who's in charge.

284
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:28,344
<i>GI bleed's more likely</i>

285
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:29,628
to explain
the nausea and weakness.

286
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,879
Who's in charge?

287
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:32,497
<i>House, as long</i>
<i>as you're not here,</i>

288
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,183
someone has to have the final...
<i>Let me rephrase.</i>

289
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:35,334
Who's your daddy?

290
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:36,218
<i>Let me rephrase.</i>

291
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:37,669
<i>You have to decide</i>

292
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:38,721
<i>if you're gonna buck up,</i>
<i>get out of bed,</i>

293
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:40,022
and do your job,

294
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:41,223
or if you're gonna wallow
in self-pity.

295
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,776
Those my only two choices?

296
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:46,895
Or can I also point out
the self-pity coming from you?

297
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,398
<i>You're just annoyed because</i>
<i>when your relationship ended,</i>

298
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:51,400
<i>no one gave a crap,</i>
<i>including you.</i>

299
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:53,902
That is not true
in so many ways.

300
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:55,621
<i>And, Chase,</i>
<i>stop screwing with Foreman.</i>

301
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:57,156
<i>And, Foreman, no.</i>

302
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,108
<i>Till the telephone</i>
<i>gets uninvented,</i>

303
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:00,876
<i>no one in that room needs more</i>
<i>authority than I give them,</i>

304
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,910
<i>and right now</i>

305
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:03,245
I give you the authority

306
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:05,631
to scope his GI tract
and biopsy his parotid.

307
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:07,699
<i>And you can pick up the phone.</i>

308
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:10,753
Wait, House, should we
be more worried about you?

309
00:14:10,837 --> 00:14:12,087
Are you on Vicodin?

310
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:13,589
Because if you are,

311
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:15,941
<i>you probably shouldn't</i>
<i>be ordering procedures.</i>

312
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:21,814
I am not on Vicodin.

313
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:24,400
<i>Do the tests.</i>

314
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:26,568
I have to see a man
about a hurdy-gurdy.

315
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,058
You really think House
isn't using Vicodin?

316
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:35,811
Does it actually worry you?

317
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,112
If he's
self-prescribing meds,

318
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,163
that could affect his judgment.

319
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:39,698
And does that worry you?

320
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:41,400
Are you being sarcastic?

321
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:44,086
If his rule-breaking
is affecting his judgment,

322
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,804
then you can step in
and you can worry,

323
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:48,223
but if he's just
coming up with ideas

324
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,542
that we haven't thought of
but we should have,

325
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:52,795
then our job
is to shut up and do it.

326
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:55,247
And what do you see
in this guy?

327
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:56,932
Hmm? What? Who?

328
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:02,254
Oh. You think I'm attracted
to our patient?

329
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:03,755
Right.

330
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:04,756
It's against the rules,

331
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:07,609
so you wouldn't do it.

332
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:09,928
He's a macho half-wit.

333
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,780
You have every reason
to not be attracted to him,

334
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:13,399
which is why
I ask the question.

335
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,567
Why are you attracted to him?

336
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:17,219
Stop it.
I'm just...

337
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:18,821
No, no, no. Take out the scope.
But I don't see...

338
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:19,955
Not the monitor.
Look at his eyes.

339
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:27,329
<i>Sclerae turned yellow.</i>
<i>Did X-rays.</i>

340
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:28,947
<i>Looks like there's a mass</i>
<i>in his liver,</i>

341
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:30,416
<i>but the conductive</i>
<i>metal rod in his ribs</i>

342
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:31,333
<i>is blocking it.</i>

343
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:33,585
Making it, as they say,

344
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:37,089
as tough to find as a hooker
who can play the hurdy-gurdy.

345
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,424
If you have a point,
can you please...

346
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,508
<i>It's an expression.</i>

347
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:41,977
Means it's tough,

348
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:43,662
<i>but apparently it can be done.</i>

349
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,446
<i>If we don't have any equipment...</i>

350
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,431
You have eyes.

351
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:47,182
Not that see through stuff.

352
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:49,435
<i>Obviously.</i>

353
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:50,402
You want us to cut him open?

354
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,937
Only if you want to see

355
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:52,988
what's wrong with him.

356
00:15:56,993 --> 00:15:58,777
Do you know <i>Free Bird?</i>

357
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:07,202
Do you see what I see?

358
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:08,670
No.

359
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:10,289
Exactly.

360
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:13,792
More suction.

361
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:17,713
That's impossible.

362
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:20,549
I definitely saw a mass
on the X-rays.

363
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,384
It's gone now.

364
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:29,308
It's a mass...

365
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,226
And then it's not.

366
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:33,362
You, uh, gonna introduce us?

367
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:38,200
Team, meet Duke.

368
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:40,369
Anke.

369
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:42,654
Anke?
How'd I get Duke?

370
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:45,374
House, how many prostitutes
have you had?

371
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,742
As in eaten?

372
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:48,861
<i>Ever? This year?</i>

373
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:50,913
Slept with.
Since you've been here.

374
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,131
All but one.

375
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,133
She did my taxes.

376
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:56,819
<i>On the other hand,</i>

377
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:58,854
tapeworm that burrowed
outside his intestinal...

378
00:16:58,922 --> 00:16:59,805
<i>We would have seen eggs</i>

379
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:00,806
on a fecal smear

380
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:02,457
or systemic eosinophilia.

381
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:04,326
Detached cyst?

382
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:05,227
<i>Couldn't migrate that far</i>

383
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:06,478
in one hour.

384
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:07,863
We haven't been
sitting on our hands

385
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:10,732
<i>just waiting</i>
<i>for your brilliance to kick in.</i>

386
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,801
Okay, so how did you shoot down

387
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,686
intermittently swollen
lymph node?

388
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:20,892
<i>That would mean it's</i>
<i>some kind of an infection,</i>

389
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,778
which would mean we'd have to do
a spinal tap.

390
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:24,413
But with his recent
skull fractures,

391
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:26,665
<i>it could be an increased ICP.</i>

392
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:27,899
His brain could herniate.

393
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,284
What about
a ventricular puncture?

394
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,236
Sounds good.

395
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:34,840
You think sticking a needle
directly into his brain

396
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:37,042
would be less dangerous
than sticking it in his spine?

397
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:38,544
It's probably a push.

398
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:40,078
I'm just trying
to get you out of here,

399
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:41,613
because underneath this sheet,

400
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:44,216
stuff is going on.

401
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,385
Just pick a spot
and stick a needle in it.

402
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:52,224
You want to drill
through my skull

403
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:54,476
because of a mass
that's not there?

404
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:56,428
It was there, which means
something is wrong.

405
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,230
We need to find it.

406
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:00,265
Is there anybody
you'd like us to call?

407
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:03,035
Someone that you'd like
to be here with you?

408
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:05,103
Maybe a wife or girlfriend?

409
00:18:05,154 --> 00:18:06,872
<i>No, my family's</i>
<i>all back in Oklahoma,</i>

410
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:08,407
and the guys on the circuit

411
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,459
are in Calgary
at the next rodeo.

412
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:12,377
Ah, that's too bad.

413
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:14,263
It's nice to have
somebody nearby

414
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,266
you can talk to who cares.

415
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,753
You okay?

416
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:23,055
Hmm?

417
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:26,141
You just sang, "it's good
to have somebody near by

418
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,143
to talk to who cares."

419
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:30,795
Okay, fine. I like him.
So what?

420
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:32,397
No kidding.
I just can't figure out why.

421
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:34,099
Yeah.

422
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,983
Neither can I.

423
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:38,770
Looks clear.

424
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:40,923
Nothing is suggesting
inflammation.

425
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:43,742
Something's wrong.

426
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:45,861
O-2 stats are plummeting.
We need to intubate.

427
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:47,412
Drop the table.

428
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:54,536
I can't get it in.

429
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:56,838
The airway's blocked.
Get the trach kit.

430
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,809
O-2 are going back up.

431
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,944
What's that smell?

432
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:21,613
Did he defecate?

433
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:26,017
Doesn't look like it.

434
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,186
I think it's his feet.

435
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,573
Oh.

436
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:34,025
Oh, man.

437
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:36,378
Ugh.

438
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:37,696
It's definitely his feet.

439
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:40,991
<i>Please don't.</i>

440
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:45,882
That is a nice bow.

441
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:48,251
That was a nice door.

442
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:49,552
Put it on my tab.

443
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,940
Let's say we
take it up a notch.

444
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:55,358
Yeah, right.
Very funny.

445
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:56,943
You don't trust me?

446
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:58,061
No.

447
00:19:58,112 --> 00:19:59,696
I'll do it.

448
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:03,650
And we have a gamer.

449
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,318
<i>Oh, come on, man.</i>

450
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:06,569
You can't be serious.

451
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,904
Why not?

452
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:09,873
Anything goes wrong,
we just take her to the doctor.

453
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,325
And I'm only eight paces away.

454
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:13,776
House...
I like you, Carnell.

455
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,829
Don't ruin it.

456
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:19,782
Stinky feet can point
to diabetes,

457
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,552
<i>athlete's foot,</i>
<i>or gangrene... Pick one.</i>

458
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,503
<i>No!</i>

459
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:25,054
Uh, none.

460
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:26,789
None of those
cause bloody sputum

461
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:28,457
or disappearing masses.

462
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:30,126
No. No. No. No.

463
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:31,794
<i>You're gonna kill her.</i>

464
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,479
<i>Don't do that, Carnell.</i>

465
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,815
<i>They might get the idea</i>
<i>that I'm shooting at a hooker.</i>

466
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:44,324
Fungal infection can cause
ulceration between the toes

467
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,860
<i>and bleeding could be</i>
<i>from recurring abscesses</i>

468
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:48,828
<i>that appear to be</i>
<i>recurring masses.</i>

469
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,646
Symptoms in the head or feet

470
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:51,781
<i>mean the infection</i>
<i>would have to be</i>

471
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:53,416
<i>in the heart or the brain.</i>

472
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:54,951
<i>I say we start
by looking in the heart,</i>

473
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:56,452
<i>because looking at his brain</i>

474
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:57,787
with a metal plate
is problematic.

475
00:20:57,838 --> 00:20:59,539
So's MRI'ing his heart.

476
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:01,875
He's got a seven-centimeter
conductive metal rod

477
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:03,927
<i>holding his rib together.</i>
<i>It'll rip him in two.</i>

478
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:06,296
No, it'll just feel like
it's ripping him in two,

479
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:08,014
which is much better.

480
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:09,432
<i>We could minimize the damage</i>

481
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:11,667
by injecting ice water
into his abdominal cavity.

482
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,853
<i>No. Please, no.</i>

483
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,230
Oh, God!

484
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,732
Oops.

485
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:28,902
<i>Got to go.</i>

486
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:29,953
Call an ambulance!

487
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,987
Why?

488
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:32,355
What do you mean why?

489
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:33,356
She's hurt!

490
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:35,191
She doesn't look hurt.

491
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:41,864
No, you didn't.

492
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,499
<i>Yes, we did.</i>

493
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:50,640
You're an ass.

494
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:54,344
Okay. Go get me, uh,
general Patton's colt 45.

495
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:56,045
<i>The one with the two notches.</i>

496
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,397
He's not getting you a gun.

497
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:02,151
Your friend knows
how to have a good time.

498
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,908
<i>The MRI magnets are gonna</i>
<i>heat the metal.</i>

499
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:09,859
<i>Could get to over 300 degrees</i>

500
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,361
in 15 seconds.

501
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,696
Which is why
we're injecting ice water

502
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,282
into your abdominal cavity.

503
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,251
You'll feel colder
than you've ever felt,

504
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,087
and then you'll be hotter...

505
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:24,257
Um, you'll <i>feel</i> hotter
than you've ever felt.

506
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:29,512
We'll try to be
as quick as possible.

507
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:32,415
Wow.

508
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,183
Shut up.

509
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:43,810
It's interesting.

510
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:45,278
No, it's not.

511
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:47,613
It's mundane and simple.

512
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:51,367
He's obviously
a very blessed specimen,

513
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:53,269
so from an evolutionary
point of view,

514
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,104
he'd produce healthy offspring,

515
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:57,373
so my prefrontal cortex
is telling me

516
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:59,208
I should have sex with him.

517
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:01,610
Oh. Is that all?
Yes.

518
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:04,080
My rational brain knows
he's a hillbilly and an idiot.

519
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:05,965
<i>And yet somehow</i>
<i>your rational brain</i>

520
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,301
is losing the argument,
which is interesting.

521
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:11,754
You were bored.

522
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:13,890
You must have spent
about two days

523
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:16,893
setting up a fake murder,
and you were bored.

524
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,028
I'm fine.

525
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:20,629
You're not.

526
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:24,767
And I'm worried you might
do something even stupider.

527
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:26,569
Why don't you move back in
with me?

528
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,471
At least until
you get back on track.

529
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:31,140
What an ego.

530
00:23:31,191 --> 00:23:33,576
You think you're some sort
of emotional paragon?

531
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:34,660
You're my rock?

532
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:35,978
I'm trying to be a friend.

533
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,330
At least I have the good sense

534
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:40,649
not to marry every woman
I fall into bed with.

535
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:42,418
Maybe you should move in
with me.

536
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,587
Either way.
If you prefer...

537
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:46,122
I prefer you to stop talking
about this.

538
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:47,874
House, we haven't even started
talking about this

539
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,176
except to establish the fact
that you are fine,

540
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,160
which clearly you aren't.

541
00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:53,096
Leave me alone!

542
00:23:57,217 --> 00:23:58,667
No.

543
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,520
We are gonna talk about this,

544
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:02,855
and we're gonna deal with this.

545
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:06,776
So I have no choice?

546
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:10,613
Fine.

547
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:12,848
Unless...

548
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,235
Unless...Yes, I do.

549
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,954
I do have legs.

550
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,708
I see you didn't factor those
into your brilliant plan.

551
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,221
Lane, can you
try to hold still?

552
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:37,006
I'm trying.

553
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:38,724
Real hard.

554
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:44,547
Guy is tough.
I'll give him that.

555
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:46,882
My prefrontal cortex
is a little aroused.

556
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:48,484
Just get the damn picture.

557
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:49,619
Rib temp is at 158.

558
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:54,490
I don't have a clear view
of his aorta yet.

559
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:55,891
This isn't gonna work.
We have to stop.

560
00:24:55,943 --> 00:24:57,076
No. You're trying
to protect him

561
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,078
instead of trying to save him.

562
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:00,696
He's smoking.

563
00:25:00,747 --> 00:25:02,165
Literally, you ass.

564
00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:03,749
Five more seconds.

565
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:04,750
No, getting a good image

566
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:05,868
isn't gonna mean anything

567
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,853
if he doesn't have a rib cage.

568
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:11,073
Got it.

569
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:24,804
Whew.

570
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:29,559
The images, they're normal.

571
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,060
<i>Whew.</i>

572
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:36,532
<i>Ah. Whew.</i>

573
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:50,363
You're gonna have to talk
to him eventually.

574
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,316
He needs you.

575
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:58,888
I love him.

576
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:02,124
And I know he loves me.

577
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:03,259
But I just can't...

578
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,595
He needs you in his life.

579
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:08,964
Even if you're not sleeping
with him, he needs you.

580
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:11,634
Without you...

581
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:13,970
You can't go backwards.

582
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,443
I can't fix his problem.

583
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:25,848
I <i>am</i> his problem.

584
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,945
If the infection's
not in his heart,

585
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:41,114
then it's in his brain.

586
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:42,832
You're in my sun.

587
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,567
Do a CT.
We can't.

588
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:45,702
He has a titanium plate

589
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:46,603
and a bunch of metal screws.

590
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,921
Get rid of them.

591
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:50,089
His skull has multiple
hairline fractures.

592
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:51,090
<i>Removing the metal plate</i>

593
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:52,342
<i>will be like removing</i>

594
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,377
half an eggshell
without cracking

595
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:55,378
<i>the rest of the shell.</i>

596
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:56,796
And not removing the plate

597
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,181
will be like leaving
the egg out to rot.

598
00:26:58,248 --> 00:26:59,999
We can't cut off
the top of his head

599
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:01,618
based on a few symptoms
that disappear

600
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:03,269
<i>whenever we try</i>
<i>to test for them.</i>

601
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:09,943
What if the one symptom
that hasn't disappeared

602
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:12,228
was never actually there?

603
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,530
Any delays
when he answers questions?

604
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,218
He doesn't have
partial hearing loss.

605
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:21,454
He's missing moments.

606
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:22,855
<i>He reported having something</i>

607
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:25,908
like a complex partial seizure
during a bull ride.

608
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,910
Said it hasn't happened since,
but what if he's wrong?

609
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:29,545
What if the infection
in the brain

610
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:31,047
is causing it
to happen all the time?

611
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:33,650
His E.E.G. didn't show any sign
of seizure activity.

612
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:34,801
I didn't say it was a seizure.

613
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:36,252
I said it was something
like a seizure.

614
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:37,804
And I'm guessing
you're about to tell us

615
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:39,839
we need to find something
like an E.E.G. to prove...

616
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:41,641
Nope, 'cause I already got one.

617
00:27:44,812 --> 00:27:46,596
You want me to sing?

618
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,681
How's singing <i>My Bonnie</i> gonna
help you see inside my brain?

619
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:49,849
<i>It won't.</i>

620
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,234
It's just gonna prove
that we need

621
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,186
to cut into your skull,

622
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,988
which is gonna
be kind of dangerous.

623
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:57,490
So you've got a real incentive
to sing like an angel.

624
00:27:57,574 --> 00:27:58,974
We think you're having
mini blackouts,

625
00:27:59,026 --> 00:28:00,660
but your brain compensates.

626
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:04,364
<i>But it can't compensate</i>
<i>if there's a preset rhythm.</i>

627
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:09,419
One, two, three.

628
00:28:09,486 --> 00:28:13,289
♪ My Bonnie
lies over the ocean ♪

629
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,991
♪ my Bonnie lies... ♪

630
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:18,211
♪ ...over the sea ♪

631
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:22,265
♪ My Bonnie...
lies over the ocean ♪

632
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:26,102
♪ Oh, bring back
my Bonnie to me ♪

633
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:27,553
See? Told ya.

634
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:30,723
Lane, that wasn't even close.

635
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:37,313
That was brilliant.

636
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:40,400
Yeah.

637
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:59,419
It's understandable.

638
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:04,006
I hate when you do that.

639
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:06,592
You respond to what you think
I'm thinking,

640
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:09,395
because you think
that I think like you do.

641
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,730
It's insulting and annoying.

642
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,401
You're scared because
nothing excites you.

643
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:17,670
Fun doesn't excite you.

644
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:19,355
Puzzles don't excite you.

645
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:21,491
What's left?

646
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:23,843
And I was saying you're right.

647
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:28,948
You're upset.
You're depressed.

648
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:30,950
Everything's gonna taste
a little worse right now,

649
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:33,069
but it'll pass.

650
00:29:35,923 --> 00:29:38,007
It's understandable.

651
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:40,376
You're scared because
you think I'm falling apart,

652
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:42,378
and you're trying
to convince yourself

653
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:44,430
that you're overreacting.

654
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:48,267
Keeps ringing.

655
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:50,920
Yeah.

656
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:52,922
House, there's no infection
in this guy's brain.

657
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:54,390
CT's clean.

658
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:56,976
Well, that sucks.

659
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,613
Now we have
to blow up his heart.

660
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,567
We're not blowing up his heart,

661
00:30:04,618 --> 00:30:05,985
because we've
ruled out his heart.

662
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:08,237
MRI and transesophageal echo
reveal no swelling,

663
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:09,438
no masses, no vegetation,

664
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,573
no sign of anything.

665
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:16,629
'Cause we're looking
the wrong way.

666
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,681
There's an imperfection.

667
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,700
How do you find where?

668
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:22,952
I don't know.
Get a magnifying glass and...

669
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:24,971
You suck.

670
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:28,474
Feel free to interpret
that both ways.

671
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,642
Suck on the straw,

672
00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:30,810
see where the drink leaks.

673
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:32,562
You're saying we put
pressure on his aorta

674
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:34,013
until it rips open?

675
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:36,115
You do realize
the downside of that?

676
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,100
<i>If we don't rip it,</i>

677
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:39,635
the damage
from the infection will,

678
00:30:39,686 --> 00:30:41,854
probably not when he's got
his chest open in an O.R.

679
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,407
where it can be repaired
inside the 60 seconds

680
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:45,741
it'll take him
to bleed to death.

681
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:46,776
<i>It's a ridiculous idea.</i>

682
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:47,994
It won't work.

683
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:49,529
Now if you don't mind...

684
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:51,697
Get this guy's approval
to rip his heart open.

685
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,922
Hey.

686
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:09,040
We think you have
a Bartonella infection,

687
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:12,176
which caused a mycotic aneurysm
in your aortic wall.

688
00:31:12,227 --> 00:31:14,012
We need to find it,

689
00:31:14,063 --> 00:31:16,898
which means we need
to blow up your heart.

690
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:19,600
And, yes, I'm as serious
as a heart attack.

691
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:21,853
We're going to increase
your blood pressure

692
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:25,073
until the weak spot
in your aortic wall explodes.

693
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:26,524
Hopefully we'll
be able to fix it

694
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:28,192
before you bleed to death.

695
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:32,497
Any questions?

696
00:31:32,564 --> 00:31:34,048
Nope.

697
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,668
Really?

698
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:38,086
You don't even want to know

699
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:40,221
if you'll be able to go
back to bull riding?

700
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,622
I assume no?

701
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:43,841
I mean, you've already
cracked open my skull,

702
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:47,845
and now you're gonna
blow up my heart.

703
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:50,298
Thought you loved
those eight seconds.

704
00:31:57,056 --> 00:32:00,108
I do.

705
00:32:00,192 --> 00:32:04,178
And now you're telling me
that I got to give them up.

706
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:09,917
<i>I can always find</i>
<i>something else to love.</i>

707
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:18,275
<i>House.</i>

708
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:21,295
We need to talk.

709
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:33,474
You didn't expect me to say yes

710
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,226
to rupturing his aorta,
did you?

711
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:36,978
Since I didn't ask,

712
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:39,463
I wasn't expecting you
to say anything at all.

713
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:41,949
You have no reason to believe
this will save his life.

714
00:32:42,017 --> 00:32:43,818
Really?

715
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:45,420
No reason? None at all?

716
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:47,321
I'm just planning on
cracking open his chest,

717
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:50,241
blowing up his heart,
what, to pad his bill?

718
00:32:50,308 --> 00:32:51,943
Or you think that since
you broke my heart

719
00:32:51,994 --> 00:32:55,646
I want to break his.

720
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:57,248
I don't know.

721
00:32:57,315 --> 00:33:00,118
I think maybe you're
looking for something

722
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:03,254
that can excite you.

723
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:05,673
Fill a void.

724
00:33:05,741 --> 00:33:09,160
And it's affecting
your judgment.

725
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:11,712
You're right.
I am.

726
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:14,665
My damaged, depressed,
drug-addled judgment

727
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:15,833
is still better than yours

728
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:17,351
or any other doctor
in this hospital,

729
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:20,521
and my team is gonna do this
procedure and save his life.

730
00:33:20,606 --> 00:33:23,057
So you can either have security
arrest me and my team,

731
00:33:23,142 --> 00:33:27,979
or you can get
the hell out of my way.

732
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,397
And she caves.

733
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,794
<i>Rib spreader in place.</i>

734
00:33:42,861 --> 00:33:43,995
Heart looks good.

735
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:46,864
The aorta's exposed.

736
00:33:54,673 --> 00:33:57,308
I take it you
ratted me out to Cuddy.

737
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:02,680
I think your judgment
is compromised.

738
00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:04,732
No, you don't.

739
00:34:04,817 --> 00:34:06,017
Come on.

740
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:07,218
I got a squash game at 2:00.

741
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:08,886
Let's give this cowboy a ride.

742
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:10,054
<i>If I inject more,</i>

743
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:11,239
there won't be any room
for the blood

744
00:34:11,323 --> 00:34:12,023
to go through
the rest of his body.

745
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:14,725
You're right.

746
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:16,777
Let's make damn sure
we don't damage his toes

747
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:17,862
while we blow up his heart.

748
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,409
No bubbles,
no bruising, no gaps.

749
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,962
It's not working.

750
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:37,265
Yes, it is.

751
00:34:41,503 --> 00:34:44,205
I was wrong.

752
00:34:44,273 --> 00:34:46,140
Not yet.

753
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:47,475
Let's switch him over
to bypass for the debridement.

754
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,809
Come on.
We don't have much time.

755
00:34:48,894 --> 00:34:50,895
Slow the heart down
so it doesn't...

756
00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:52,363
<i>Damn.</i>

757
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,531
<i>Clamp.</i>

758
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:55,066
We can't clamp the aorta
at this pressure.

759
00:34:55,117 --> 00:34:56,100
Even if you can see
through all the blood.

760
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:57,201
Do it anyway.

761
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,070
We need suction
and more sponges.

762
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:01,906
Leak is too fast.

763
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:04,441
No, it's not.
We can fix this.

764
00:35:31,186 --> 00:35:33,187
It worked.

765
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:38,142
House, it worked.

766
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:42,280
I heard you.

767
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,359
Hey.

768
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,112
I'm awake,
so I guess it worked.

769
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:23,900
As long as you don't get
your heart rate too high.

770
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,842
You, uh, probably shouldn't
have sex for a while.

771
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:31,622
I'll keep that in mind.

772
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:37,812
Want to hang out,
see your ranch sometime?

773
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,148
Uh...

774
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,073
That would probably
be inappropriate,

775
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:52,643
'cause I'm your doctor
and everything.

776
00:36:56,932 --> 00:37:00,484
Good luck with everything.

777
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:11,862
I...

778
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,421
Double scotch.
Doubled.

779
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,206
Uh, blended? Single malt?
Any preference?

780
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,292
No.

781
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,015
Yeah, sorry about the noise.

782
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:32,883
I guess, uh, their team won.

783
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:36,270
Although I got to tell you,

784
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,773
sometimes I wish I could still
act like that, you know?

785
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,857
Just let loose.

786
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,698
Ah, I guess it's
a little easier, though,

787
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,783
when you got no troubles.

788
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,035
Parents still
paying your bills.
