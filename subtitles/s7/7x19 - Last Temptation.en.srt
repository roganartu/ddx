It's peculiar?

298

House doesn't think
you're weird,

Lying about a lie,

Why are you lying

337
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:55,253
Because the real reason
I was gone

Couldn't you just say that?

340
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:02,227

00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:41,768
On your way to do that,

357
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:45,238
did you happen to stop
and give Thirteen an LP?

<i>small pupils,</i>

359
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:51,346

360
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:55,317
Yes.
And I still broke a rule.

Not <i>this</i> man.

365
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,029
No.

Not liking it is fine.

367
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:10,000

- Not anymore.

without compromising.

374
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,450
No, you can't.

Next.

394
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:44,731
Welcome

Grab a donut

We're out of donuts.

400
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,810
Then, uh, get to work.

Generally speaking,

pledges aren't supposed
to talk

416
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,200
unless they
ask a question.

417
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:53,269
That's because,
generally speaking,

418
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:54,970
pledges don't have
anything to say.

419
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:00,943

Is that patient
Kendall Pearson?

421
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:04,813
I thought
she was discharged.

422
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:06,348
Mm.
It's a House case.

00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:14,989
Yes, I know.
I was there.

00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:47,154
Last I heard,
you were going home.

430
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:49,256
Kendall collapsed
in the parking lot.

431
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:50,791
They're doing something

432
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,761
called a "sympathectomy."

433
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:56,298
She must've had
a hypertensive crisis

00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:57,800
caused by a neural
overstimulation

435
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:59,201
in her kidneys.

436
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:00,937
So they're cutting
the nerves.

437
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:02,271
It's like cutting
the gas line

439
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:07,043
Yeah, sounds like
what Dr. Taub said.

440
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,778
Said it's basic surgery,
but...

441
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:10,179
It is.

She's different.

451
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:45,215
So you have to be different.

452
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,787

He requested a surgical consult
for his patient.

for a consult.

You ever get sick
from poultry?

544
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,877

that's why I'm sick?

547
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,050
I think that can
was chock-full

548
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:26,787
of a bacteria
called salmonella enteritis.

00:26:34,396 --> 00:26:35,930
is this good news or bad?

554
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:37,431
Well, if I'm right,

555
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:40,702
that means all you'll need
are antibiotics.

556
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:43,705
And you'll be, uh,
well, shipshape.

557
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:46,040
Sorry.
Couldn't resist.

558
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:53,147
Did you always know
that sailing was it for you?

559
00:26:53,215 --> 00:26:54,382
That it was the right thing?

560
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,485
Didn't even start
till I was ten.

561
00:26:57,553 --> 00:27:00,622
And at first,
I was not a fan.

562
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,991
Certainly there's plenty
not to like about sailing.

563
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,293
But now that you're
so into it...

564
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:06,561
Oh, no, there's still
plenty of things

565
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:08,163
I hate about it.

566
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,832
I hate being wet.
I hate being cold.

567
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,734
I hate eating nothing
but freeze-dried food.

568
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:15,069
That is quite
the endorsement.

569
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:16,771
Sailing is amazing.

570
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,773
But doesn't mean I love
every second on the boat.

571
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:21,875
Doing what you love
means dealing

572
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:23,810
with things you don't.

573
00:27:23,878 --> 00:27:25,278

to overcome,

00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:28,114
Ow.

576
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,088
Salmonella enteritis
is a nice catch.

577
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,057
Thanks. Starting
on the soft tissue windows.

<i>Once this case is over,</i>
<i>you going back to surgery?</i>

579
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:44,632
That's the plan.

580
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:48,670
I think that's a mistake.

581
00:27:48,738 --> 00:27:50,405
I think you should go back
to surgery.

582
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:53,575
I just said I was.

583
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:56,178
No. You said
it was your plan.

584
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:58,246
Which means House
might be right.

585
00:27:58,314 --> 00:28:01,984
And you might be lying
to yourself.

586
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:03,885
Would it be so terrible?

587
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:06,021
You chose House
over surgery.

588
00:28:06,088 --> 00:28:07,656
My time here changed me

589
00:28:07,723 --> 00:28:11,493
in ways not everyone in my life
thought was for the better.

590
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:13,728
No masses.
Moving on to bone windows.

591
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:20,736
Are those people right?

592
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:25,608
I think when you do change,

593
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:27,409
it's not so simple
to go back.

594
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,479
There.

595
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:33,082
<i>In the humerus.</i>

596
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:37,153
Doesn't look like
an infection.

597
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,188
That's because it looks
like cancer.

598
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:53,604
You have lymphoid sarcoma.

599
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:55,639
A cancer in the bone
in your arm.

600
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:00,845
Am I going to be okay?

601
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,315
It's a treatable cancer.

602
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:05,550
But part
of that treatment

603
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,052
involves amputating
your arm.

604
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,021
I'm sorry.

605
00:29:09,088 --> 00:29:11,056
There's nothing else?

606
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:15,961
We can do chemo and radiation

607
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:17,295
after the amputation.

608
00:29:17,363 --> 00:29:19,964
I don't mean after.
I mean instead of.

609
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:21,432
If I leave soon,
I still have time

610
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,700
to break the record.

611
00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:24,702
Honey,
you can't be serious.

612
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,037
I feel fine.

613
00:29:26,105 --> 00:29:27,705
Last night, they thought
it was an infection.

614
00:29:27,773 --> 00:29:28,907
We know it's cancer.

615
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:30,441
We ran the biopsy
three times.

616
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,009
<i>You don't know</i>

617
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:33,444
how fast--
postponing the surgery

618
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:35,513
could increase the likelihood
that the cancer will spread.

619
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,882
Kendall, you need to think
about what the doctor's saying.

620
00:29:37,949 --> 00:29:38,916
I'm thinking

621
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:40,484
about the sail.

622
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:41,953

since I was ten.

623
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,821
Don't take this
away from me.

624
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:45,991

628
00:29:50,463 --> 00:29:51,897
She'll be risking her life.

629
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:54,299
I think we need
to discuss this as a family.

00:29:57,704 --> 00:29:58,704
You're considering this?

She's not budging.
She wants to launch tomorrow.

634
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:38,777
She's a minor.

635
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:42,180
You sign the consent form,
we can do the surgery.

636
00:30:42,248 --> 00:30:44,817
Amputation can be an emo--

637
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,287
She's talked my wife
into agreeing with her.

638
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:51,291
One parent's signature
is enough.

639
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:58,231
She needs you
to be a parent.

640
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:01,167
You're asking me
to blow up my family.

641
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:04,003
I'm asking you
to save your family.

642
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,739
On her first solo
Atlantic crossing,

643
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:10,675
she scheduled a court date

644
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,010
to become
an emancipated minor.

645
00:31:13,912 --> 00:31:17,615
She'll do it again
and she'll win.

646
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:21,185
She is gonna do
what she's gonna do

647
00:31:21,252 --> 00:31:22,853
with or without me.

648
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:27,258
I'd rather have it
be with.

649
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,713
I'm stuck.

650
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,315
No, you're not.

651
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:51,651
Case is over.
You're back to surgery.

652
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,957

Sign on the door

659

means I'm finished.

00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:15,576
Pretty sure the law
of the land states

662
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:18,012
that everyone has the right
to be an idiot.

663
