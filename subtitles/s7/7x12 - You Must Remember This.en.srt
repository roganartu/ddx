1
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:04,652
Excuse me, waitress?

2
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:06,678
I'm afraid
the teriyaki chicken's

3
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:08,096
no longer on the menu.

4
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:10,581
Oh, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:11,749
That's what
you had last time.

6
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,701
We've never
been here before.

7
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:16,036
I definitely remember you.
<i>No, we never get up north.</i>

8
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:17,121
We're just up to see
a friend of ours

9
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:18,923
who moved here
last summer.

10
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:22,909
Your hair was lighter.
You had little round glasses.

11
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:24,213
Sounds like you.

12
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:26,482
Henry, don't play along.
It's a gimmick, for tips.

13
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,948
Could we get some water?

14
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:33,470
It was last August.
Saturday, the 14th.

15
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:35,389
You were wearing
a blue dress with polka dots.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
Your eyes were puffy,

17
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:37,441
like you'd been crying.

18
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,762
The 14th
is Darren's birthday.

19
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:43,147
He said he had
to cancel his party

20
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,766
'cause his old girlfriend
showed up.

21
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:46,166
They got into a huge fight.

22
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:48,268
- Henry...
- I knew it. Damn it.

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,436
<i>Ever since that ski trip</i>

24
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:50,654
<i>when the two of you</i>
<i>disappeared.</i>

25
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:52,656
I'll go...Get your water.

26
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,112
Are you all right?

27
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:01,248
Are you okay?

28
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:10,541
I can't move my legs!

Picture a door.

32
00:01:43,497 --> 00:01:46,216
Unlocked with the key
of the mind.

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,836
Two medical cases, both
more fascinating than the last.

34
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:52,255
<i>That actually makes no logical sense.</i>

35
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,257
<i>This is not a door</i>
<i>to logical sense.</i>

36
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,975
<i>Also, shut up.</i>

37
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:59,566
Case number one.

38
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,599
33-year-old woman

39
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,401
named...

40
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:04,735
Something I can't remember.

41
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,938
You'll see the irony
in a second.

42
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:08,685
Presenting with
temporary paralysis,

43
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:10,085
high CK levels,

44
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:13,828
and a perfect memory.

45
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:17,114
How perfect is perfect?

46
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:18,278
<i>Perfectly perfect.</i>

47
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:19,678
Hyperthymesia.

48
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:21,419
<i>Complete recall</i>

49
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:22,620
of every moment of every day

50
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,621
<i>since puberty.</i>

51
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:27,508
All 7,600,049 of them.

52
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,677
It's cool, huh?

53
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:31,929
One of only a handful
of recorded cases.

54
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:33,130
So we have two symptoms:

55
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:35,383
Temporary leg paralysis
and elevated CK.

56
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,351
Obviously you're not suffering
from the same condition

57
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,887
'cause you've already forgotten
my dramatic voiceover.

58
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:41,105
There's a third symptom.

59
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:42,957
- Her memory's unrelated.
- <i>Why?</i>

60
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,341
It's a strange
medical phenomenon--

61
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:46,944
Hyperthymesia is known
to manifest in adolescence.

62
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:49,091
Yeah, in the whole five
documented cases.

63
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,870
To be related, it would mean
20 years between symptoms.

64
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:53,317
<i>Plus, I don't know</i>
<i>of any diseases</i>

65
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:54,485
<i>that cause great memory.</i>

66
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:56,070
Only ones that destroy it.

67
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,623
MRI showed no evidence
of stroke or tumor,

68
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,928
so probably a toxin.

69
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:02,928
She's a waitress. They're no strangers
to botulism or alcoholism.

70
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:05,123
We should search the diner
and where she lives.

71
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:06,351
<i>Or you could</i>
<i>search her brain.</i>

72
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:08,332
You know,
where her memory lives.

73
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:09,417
Save the gas.

74
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:11,201
You two check her home.

75
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:12,870
You two get a complete
patient history.

76
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:16,090
We'll see who gets
an answer first.

77
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:18,309
You said there's
a second case?

78
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:19,560
Oh! Yeah.

79
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:21,145
Thanks.

80
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:27,101
<i>The case of</i>
<i>the 45-year-old doctor</i>

81
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:30,605
<i>who just failed his pathology</i>
<i>recertification exam</i>

82
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,156
and is going to lose
his board certification

83
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:33,426
and get fired.

84
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:35,787
How'd you fail it? You spend
half your life in the lab.

85
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,912
I was recovering
from the flu.

86
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:39,664
I'm retaking it next week.
It's not an issue.

87
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:40,615
<i>Normally, I'd let</i>

88
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:41,916
Darwinism run its course.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,567
But Cuddy's in a big tizzy

90
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:45,536
about her poster boy
getting canned.

91
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:48,956
So how are we gonna get
the short guy off the short bus?

92
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,474
- What about a tutor?
- I don't need a tutor.

93
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,676
Tutor it is.

94
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:53,077
<i>Choose your poison.</i>

95
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:55,401
<i>Chase, if you prefer</i>
<i>pounding Aussie beers</i>

96
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,671
<i>and comiserating over</i>
<i>the suckiness of divorce</i>

97
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,773
Masters, if you want
nervous energy, flash cards,

98
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,638
and obnoxious pieces
of arcane trivia.

99
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:05,106
Foreman, if you
need to be berated

100
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,308
by a humorless hard-ass.

101
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:08,976
Foreman.

102
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,478
<i>Interesting.</i>

103
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,763
You must be more worried
than you look.

104
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,820
I need a consult,
Dr. Wilson.

105
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:22,272
So call me in a week
if it still itches.

106
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:23,607
Thank you.

107
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,109
And be sure to give Sarah
a kiss for me.

108
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:27,097
Will do.

109
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:29,954
Who's Sarah?

110
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:31,271
Her granddaughter,
I think.

111
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,522
Early stages of dementia.

112
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:34,618
What's the consult?

113
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:35,920
I need your medical opinion

114
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,838
on what bar we're gonna hit
for happy hour tonight

115
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,473
to kick off the official end

116
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:41,676
to your three-month
pity party over Sam.

117
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,311
I can't tonight.

118
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:44,478
Because of Sarah?

119
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:45,730
Yes, because of

120
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,064
my senile patient's
granddaughter.

121
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,799
You caught me.
I'm busy!

122
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,073
Who's Sarah?

123
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,142
Wilson's friend.

124
00:04:58,193 --> 00:05:00,194
My computer crashed.

125
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:02,113
Lost my database
of his acquaintances.

126
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:05,166
Or you're both lying to me.

127
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,119
I know nothing about Wilson
having a friend named Sarah.

128
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,653
Satisfied?

129
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,925
Nooo.

130
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:18,596
What are the eight types
of vomitus?

131
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:19,997
<i>I could show you four</i>
<i>right now</i>

132
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:21,632
<i>if you ask me</i>
<i>one more review question.</i>

133
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,017
Hey, you picked me.

134
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:24,334
You said you wanted
a hard-ass.

135
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:25,770
No, House said that.

136
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:28,005
I pretended to agree
to get him off my back.

137
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:30,474
I picked you because
I wanted the guy

138
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:31,341
who doesn't like
getting involved

139
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:32,843
in other people's problems.

140
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:34,228
Yes, I thought
you'd want to skip

141
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:36,864
the massive public humiliation
of getting fired.

142
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:37,782
<i>By treating me</i>
<i>like I'm an imbecile?</i>

143
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:39,784
I'm totally fine.

144
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:42,019
I aced my first
pathology boards.

145
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,623
Medicine has come a long way
in the last hundred years.

146
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,158
<i>You know...</i>

147
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,542
<i>I heard of a guy</i>

148
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:49,877
who knew a guy

149
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,496
who could get the exam
ahead of time.

150
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:55,619
It was something I heard.

151
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:58,228
<i>Patient's file</i>  said she lost
some weight on a new diet, right?

152
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,754
Yeah, she went vegan.

153
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:01,522
Are laxatives vegan?

154
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:07,112
Hello?

155
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:07,919
<i>Where are you?</i>

156
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:09,046
In the parking garage,

157
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:11,265
searching Wilson's car.

158
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:13,901
We have an answer.
Magnesium poisoning.

159
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:15,986
<i>We found a pretty large</i>
<i>stash of laxatives.</i>

160
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:17,554
<i>Abuse can lead</i>
<i>to hypermagnesemia.</i>

161
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:19,940
I admit that's...

162
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:22,793
Impressively outside-the-box
thinking.

163
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:25,112
Hmm.

164
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:26,230
<i>House.</i>

165
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:29,917
<i>You still there, House?</i>

166
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:34,455
<i>Everything okay?</i>

167
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,910
No.

168
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:40,928
For a second,
I thought Wilson

169
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,596
might have a drug problem.

170
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,850
<i>Turns out it's much,</i>
<i>much worse.</i>

171
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:49,553
Okay...Uh,
so we push fluids

172
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:51,605
<i>and wait for her kidneys</i>
<i>to clear the hypermagnesemia?</i>

173
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,308
You'll be waiting a long time
since that's not what she has.

174
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:56,426
<i>Her BP and respiratory rate</i>
<i>are normal.</i>

175
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:58,813
While you two were so busy being
impressively outside the box,

176
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,399
<i>you missed the actual box.</i>

177
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:04,452
Chase and Masters done yet?

178
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:06,376
Two light beers,
November 16th.

179
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:09,645
One really bad glass of Pinot
on the 17th.

180
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:13,160
Uh, nothing from the 18th.

181
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:15,663
Shouldn't you be working
for NASA or something?

182
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,164
You mean why am I
just a waitress?

183
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:19,783
No, I didn't mean...

184
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:21,618
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I...

185
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,787
It's okay.

186
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,139
<i>Remembering something</i>

187
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:26,290
<i>is not the same</i>
<i>as understanding it.</i>

188
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:27,842
<i>I'm not a genius.</i>

189
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:30,227
I love my job.
I'm great at it.

190
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:31,595
Keeps my mind busy.

191
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:34,077
Hi.

192
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,567
I'm Dr. House.

193
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:39,103
You are not pooping.

194
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:43,824
Question is,
are you also a klutz?

195
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:46,110
Uh...

196
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,612
I guess I'm no clumsier
than most people.

197
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:49,730
What are you guessing for?

198
00:07:49,798 --> 00:07:50,998
You've got a perfect memory.

199
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:53,784
I was told there'd be
numbers, dates, fireworks.

200
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:56,036
What do you want to know?

201
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:57,288
Let's go back to 2008.

202
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:01,559
How many trips, stumbles,
falls did you have?

203
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:05,779
11.

204
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:11,001
This really works.
Cool.

205
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:13,204
How 'bout 2009?

206
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:14,738
12.

207
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:15,990
Even cooler.
Last year?

208
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:17,775
20.

209
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:21,511
That's a big spike
in discoordination.

210
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:23,993
If you add the constipation,
it's early onset Parkinson's.

211
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:28,006
Give her a full neuro exam,
and start her on levodopa.

212
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,295
Oh, I'm so surprised
you broke into my apartment

213
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:39,363
without telling me.

214
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:40,364
<i>What is this?</i>

215
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:41,882
An intervention.

216
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,467
Exhibit A.

217
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:46,370
A baggie filled
with nepeta cataria,

218
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:47,704
also known as...

219
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:49,757
That had better not be
what I think it is.

220
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:51,342
If you mean your new
junkie girlfriend,

221
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:52,509
then yes.

222
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:55,396
House...

223
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,015
Okay, fine.
I got a cat.

224
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,516
Release the Kraken.

225
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:00,768
I don't think you appreciate

226
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,186
the severity
of your situation.

227
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:03,486
You are rapidly approaching
an end-stage male spinsterism.

228
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,775
That cat,

229
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:10,527
that diabetic cat that you're
shooting up with Insulin

230
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:12,746
and buying dime bags
of catnip for,

231
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:15,136
that means you've given up
on ever finding anyone.

232
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:17,693
Don't you think
you're completely overreacting

233
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:19,036
If I'm completely
overreacting.

234
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:20,337
why'd you lie to me?

235
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:23,207
Um, because I knew you would
completely overreact.

236
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:25,392
Its name's Sarah.

237
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,810
Cats aren't named that.
Women are.

238
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:28,295
What the Freud
is that about?

239
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:30,247
Look, I didn't name her.

240
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:31,465
My neighbor did.

241
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,601
She died, and I felt bad.

242
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:35,803
Sarah would have been
destroyed at the shelter.

243
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,389
Aww, who would want
a cat that croaks

244
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,390
if you're not home
twice a day

245
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:40,393
to shoot it up?

246
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,459
It's like having
your own button on <i>Lost.</i>

247
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:46,363
You know, I'm pretty sure

248
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:49,133
that there is
a river nearby.

249
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,068
I'm keeping her.

250
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:57,101
Okay, shrug your shoulders

251
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,401
and don't let me
push them down.

252
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:02,612
So I have to ask, uh...

253
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:04,048
Is there a trick you use?

254
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:05,299
Mnemonics?

255
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,284
<i>Meditation?</i>

256
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:08,785
No, no tricks.

257
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:09,786
I don't even try, really.

258
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:12,106
It's just there.

259
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:15,392
Is my memory gonna
go away...

260
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,677
With the Parkinson's?

261
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:18,145
It's quite possible.

262
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:19,065
<i>But we still have a lot</i>
<i>of tests to do</i>

263
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,836
<i>before we have a definitive diagnosis.</i>

264
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:22,533
Well, here's hoping
for cancer.

265
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:26,904
Nadia?

266
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:30,040
<i>Your boss called me.</i>

267
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:31,358
<i>Sorry, um...</i>

268
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:33,510
I'm Elena,
Nadia's older sister.

269
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,965
You don't have to be here.

270
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,150
<i>But I'd like to pretend</i>
<i>you'd visit me</i>

271
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,168
if I were in the hospital.

272
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,871
You brought daisies.

273
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:47,791
They're your favorite.

274
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:48,926
<i>No, they're</i>
<i>my least favorite.</i>

275
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:52,429
I was stung in the face
six times by--

276
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:55,766
Oh, God.

277
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,167
What's wrong?

278
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:58,306
My heart.

279
00:10:58,506 --> 00:10:59,706
Fast, wide-complex rhythm.

280
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,638
Get the paddles.

281
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:06,139
<i>Cardiac involvement</i>
<i>rules out Parkinson's.</i>

282
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:07,743
We're back to transient
paralysis

283
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:09,588
and high CK,
plus arrhythmia.

284
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:12,489
Masters, when you finally
blossom into a woman,

285
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,077
would you ever sleep with
a man who had a cat?

286
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,104
Sure.

287
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:17,858
Wrong, the answer is no.

288
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:20,026
Slut.

289
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:23,478
Any of you ever had a cat?

290
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,947
Any of you ever had sex?

291
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,949
I think,
as your people say,

292
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,534
<i>quod erat demonstrandum.</i>

293
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:31,786
An excess of catecholamine
could set off an arrhythmia.

294
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,655
It's not a pheo.
Her blood pressure's fine.

295
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:34,873
Maybe we're missing
the obvious.

296
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,124
<i>The heart could be</i>
<i>behind everything.</i>

297
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,043
If it's not pumping
effectively,

298
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,249
<i>the muscles shut down.</i>

299
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:41,949
CK elevates, coordination suffers.

300
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:43,498
Why are you
asking about cats?

301
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,751
Curiosity.

302
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:49,004
Can we focus here?

303
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:50,222
Uh, her heart problems

304
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,007
started when Nadia
saw her sister.

305
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:53,558
Stress-induced arrhythmia

306
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,611
could be caused by
long qt syndrome.

307
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,597
Her sister was barely
in the room five minutes.

308
00:11:58,664 --> 00:11:59,714
<i>She said</i>
<i>they'd been estranged</i>

309
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:00,765
for over six years.

310
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,133
That's a lot of tension.

311
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,319
Run a stress test
to confirm long qt.

312
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:05,487
It'll have to be
drug-induced.

313
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:06,688
Treadmill will
pull her stitches.

314
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,740
Drugs are never the answer.

315
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:10,158
If we want her heart
to go crazy,

316
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:11,376
there's something
simpler and safer.

317
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,030
Use the sister.

318
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,821
You lied to me.

319
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,206
No.

320
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,791
I said I didn't know
anything about Wilson

321
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:28,209
having a friend named Sarah.

322
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:31,031
Under House rules, that is not a lie.

323
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:34,549
He's lonely.

324
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:36,679
That cat is a nice way
for him to get some affection.

325
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:37,669
That's not
the kind of putty tat

326
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,670
he needs to be
getting it from.

327
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:40,171
He needs a putty tat
he can tap.

328
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,940
Why is it so important to you?

329
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:44,526
After divorce number two,

330
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,227
he fell into
a committed relationship

331
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,229
with a three-legged siamese.

332
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:49,614
He stopped
answering his phone,

333
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,683
redecorated his place
like Grey Gardens.

334
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,068
<i>He wasn't able</i>
<i>to come back to humanity</i>

335
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:54,286
<i>until a window was left</i>

336
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:57,539
suspiciously
and heroically open.

337
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:00,158
How that cat opened the window,
I will never know.

338
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,995
He just needs more time.

339
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:07,082
Leave him and the cat alone.

340
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,534
I won't if you will.

341
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:14,712
Sorry about the daisies.

342
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:17,077
<i>I always get it confused</i>
<i>if you love or hate them.</i>

343
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,559
Do you want to know
exactly how many times

344
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:19,776
I've told you
that I hate them?

345
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:21,245
I didn't do it on purpose.

346
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:25,716
Her heart rate
isn't moving.

347
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:28,535
The sister stress pot
needs stirring.

348
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,671
You want me
to start a fight?

349
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:31,672
No.

350
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,173
Just agitate a little.

351
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:34,258
Use something
from the history.

352
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:35,926
<i>You're not lying to them.</i>

353
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,177
In fact, you'd be
telling the truth,

354
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:38,629
and serving
their medical needs.

355
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,958
You haven't seen each other
in a while, huh?

356
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,011
<i>I heard the story</i>

357
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:55,411
<i>about the time you hit</i>

358
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,697
you hit Nadia
with the car.

359
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:57,898
<i>It must have been</i>
<i>pretty scary.</i>

360
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:02,202
Why would you
tell them that?

361
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,704
They asked about
broken bones.

362
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,105
I swear that I
checked my mirror.

363
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:06,490
You know that's a lie.

364
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:08,775
You knew
I was getting the mail,

365
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:10,908
and you just didn't care
enough to check!

366
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,408
Just like you didn't care

367
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,131
that you ruined
my 23rd birthday!

368
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:15,285
Nadia, don't start!

369
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:18,096
You started by coming here,
acting like you give a crap.

370
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:19,004
Here we go again!

371
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:20,915
I'm such a monster because
I brought daisies.

372
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,342
You--you need to leave
right now.

373
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:24,445
Well is she gonna be ok?

374
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:27,728
Elena, get out!

375
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:37,771
<i>You said you'd be</i>
<i>ten minutes.</i>

376
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:39,973
I couldn't decide
on the cheese.

377
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:42,743
When are you getting
an apartment?

378
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,194
Or at least a storage room?

379
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,195
I'll get to it.

380
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,663
I like it here.

381
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:49,583
<i>They have video on demand.</i>

382
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,097
I pulled a practice test.

383
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:52,286
I hate practice tests.

384
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,787
Hey, I never saw
<i>The Usual Suspects.</i>

385
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:55,088
You wanna check it out
before we start?

386
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:56,823
What are you doing?
You've got three days.

387
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,158
Why is everyone's
first assumption

388
00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,659
I'm gonna fail
this stupid test?

389
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,959
Maybe, because you did.

390
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:03,046
I was recovering
from the flu.

391
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:04,298
I don't care if you were
dying from ebola.

392
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:05,782
You shouldn't have gotten
less than a 70.

393
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,996
<i>You're nothing but</i>
<i>excuses and distractions.</i>

394
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:10,591
Well it's a nice match
with your condescension

395
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:11,822
and superiority.

396
00:15:13,558 --> 00:15:15,192
Enjoy the movie.

397
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:20,197
Kevin Spacey
is Keyser Soze.

398
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:34,194
How is she?

399
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,031
We started her
on a beta blocker.

400
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,300
It should keep her heart rhythm
under control.

401
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:42,169
She'll be fine
while we run more tests.

402
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,021
Did you hear that she
banned me from her room?

403
00:15:45,373 --> 00:15:46,373
<i>I know I'm not perfect,</i>

404
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:48,892
but she's...

405
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:54,898
Oh, she can be
such a bitch.

406
00:15:58,346 --> 00:15:59,253
Look, tell Nadia

407
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:02,105
she doesn't need to worry
about seeing me again.

408
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,890
I started the fight.

409
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:10,864
We needed her heart rate
to rise, so I provoked you.

410
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:16,920
You can't play
with people like that.

411
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:19,289
Maybe if I explain to Nadia--

412
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:20,570
No, it doesn't matter!

413
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,744
It's just one more fight
for her to remember.

414
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:29,132
Guess you're both bitches.

415
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:40,977
Masters.

416
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,233
Smell her breath.

417
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:47,567
Breathe out.

418
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:51,538
Ammonia.

419
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:53,040
What is it?

420
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:55,509
I think your kidneys
are shutting down.

421
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,852
Failing kidneys puts the heart
back on the list as a symptom.

422
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:02,672
Maybe she went vegan because
she lost the taste for protein.

423
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:03,972
It could be Amyloidosis.

424
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,303
We would have
seen a stiff heart

425
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:06,504
on the nuclear study.

426
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:08,173
But autoimmune
could account

427
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:10,541
for multiple organ systems
and paralysis.

428
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:11,542
<i>There are a number</i>
<i>that'd fit.</i>

429
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:13,845
Guillain-Barre,
polymyositis.

430
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:16,164
MS, polyarteritis nodosa--

431
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:17,766
sle.

432
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,984
Why are you giving me these?

433
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:20,268
Because,

434
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,237
while they're off
running all these tests,

435
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:24,189
you will be submitting
the insurance forms.

436
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,357
There's an entire department
for that.

437
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:26,524
Exactly.
The Foreman department.

438
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:28,652
Of which you are the foreman.
Foreman.

439
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:29,757
I know you got the time.

440
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,602
A little Wallaby told me
that you recently

441
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,526
vacated your post
as Taub's savior.

442
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,900
He asked.
You're worse than Masters.

443
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:37,085
How's this my fault?

444
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:38,203
He doesn't need a tutor.

445
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:39,404
He needs ritalin
and a babysitter.

446
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,339
Consider the forms
incentive.

447
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,008
Taub doesn't pass,

448
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:45,093
he'll become a permanent
part of your life.

449
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,548
This isn't really
about Cuddy, is it?

450
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,582
It's about you.

451
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:58,923
You don't want to lose me.

452
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,208
I think you care.

453
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:04,779
Don't think you can
disgust me

454
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,331
into pulling Foreman
off you.

455
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,400
<i>Pulse the patient with steroids</i>
<i>for the autoimmune.</i>

456
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:10,535
Start her on dialysis
for the kidney failure.

457
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:13,104
<i>Treat the Taub with</i>
<i>insults and small slaps</i>

458
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:14,656
for the obstinacy,

459
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:17,625
and start him on studying
for the brain failure.

460
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,611
No, that's not gonna work.

461
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,476
I have a haircut at 4 o'clock.

462
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:26,835
I'll be in the offi--

463
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:32,257
I'll be in the office
in about 20 minutes.

464
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:33,842
Yeah, okay.

465
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:46,654
<i>Agh.</i>

466
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:51,326
You planted something
in my apartment

467
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,411
to make me think
I'm allergic to Sarah.

468
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:58,333
Paranoia is the first sign
of toxoplasma gondii,

469
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,585
the parasite linked to
crazy cat lady disease.

470
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:01,669
I'm not paranoid.

471
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,922
I'm allergic to ragweed
and dandelion.

472
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,507
I'm not allergic to cats.

473
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:06,242
You're trying
to <i>gaslight</i> me.

474
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:07,542
Maybe your subconscious

475
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:10,345
is afraid that you're
gonna die alone.

476
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,298
And it just comes out
as gibberish and sneezing.

477
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:15,383
Prove that I'm overreacting.

478
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,684
Boys' night out.

479
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,136
Good Time Charlie's.

480
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:19,804
They just changed
their slogan to,

481
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:22,223
"where the trashiest ladies
get trashed."

482
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:24,275
You do see the hypocrisy
in all this, don't you?

483
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:26,344
Until recently,
your lifestyle of choice

484
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:27,529
was self-exile.

485
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,164
But I <i>never</i> had a cat.

486
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:36,621
Why don't you
pick me up at 8:00?

487
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:38,873
You're gonna need
another round of steroids.

488
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,744
In the meantime,
I'll start your dialysis.

489
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:48,699
So I heard Elena
might be coming back.

490
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,668
You think I was...

491
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,970
Too hard on her?

492
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:54,172
Well, we all
hold our grudges.

493
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,707
It's not a grudge.

494
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:56,874
It's common sense.

495
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:58,543
It's simple math.

496
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:01,062
She's hurt me
more than she's helped me.

497
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:02,498
Most people
edit their memories.

498
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:03,898
They add small, little lies

499
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:06,384
so they don't have
to face the truth.

500
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:08,486
My memories
remain the same.

501
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,572
<i>My truth never changes,</i>
<i>because...</i>

502
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:12,391
My truth <i>is</i> the truth.

503
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:15,793
So no one ever gets forgiven?

504
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:19,080
Sounds like
a lonely way to live.

505
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,615
<i>No, I-I do forgive.</i>

506
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:23,868
As long as the good things
they do...

507
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,286
Outweigh--

508
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:32,177
I can't--
I can't breathe.

509
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:45,139
Huh.

510
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:46,991
What?

511
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,309
Nothing, I just...

512
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:50,812
Always pictured your place
with shag carpet.

513
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:52,864
Like kind of a...

514
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:55,350
<i>Mod Squad</i> vibe.

515
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:56,957
Not because of
the black thing.

516
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:58,357
I always thought you were
more of...

517
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,322
You're limited to this room
and Marcus's old room.

518
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,423
Where's Marcus?

519
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:03,541
He tells me
he's working

520
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:04,463
with our Uncle
in Florida.

521
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,776
He tells you?

522
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:06,978
You don't look at
or touch anything

523
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:08,746
that doesn't belong to you,
including food.

524
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:10,598
You will study
and you will sleep.

525
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,333
And you will not leave
my sight until the exam.

526
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,919
Great, I'll be back bright
and early tomorrow, and--

527
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,410
this is no longer
just about your future.

528
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,810
It's about mine too.

529
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,626
You fail,
and I will kill you.

530
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,314
Respiratory distress
means we were wrong

531
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:28,349
about autoimmune.

532
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,151
<i>Could be pulmonary edema</i>
<i>from renal failure.</i>

533
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,574
Pulmonary edema
doesn't give you hives.

534
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,693
You think this is
an allergic reaction?

535
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:40,612
It can't be.
We pumped her full of steroids.

536
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:47,785
It can be.

537
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:49,454
If it was a really,
really bad one.

538
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:06,738
I have good news
and bad news.

539
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,522
The good news is I was right about
you having some autoimmune disease.

540
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:13,845
You're just allergic
to the dialysis.

541
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:17,282
But if I can't
have dialysis

542
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:21,235
and my kidneys
are failing,

543
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:25,540
won't that mean I'll die?

544
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,825
Well, you figured out
the bad news.

545
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:29,677
What do we do?

546
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:30,845
We look for
another case.

547
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:32,030
Even if you're
right about autoimmune,

548
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:33,482
we now don't have
time to prove it.

549
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:34,983
The transplant board will
never give her a kidney.

550
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:37,022
Maybe we could
go around them,

551
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,394
get a relative to donate.

552
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:38,854
Which relative?

553
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:41,024
The sister
who walked away

554
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:42,392
and told you she was
never coming back?

555
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:43,559
We caused this,
you know.

556
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,028
They were estranged,
but we made it worse.

557
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:46,145
That relationship
was broken

558
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,281
long before
we got there.

559
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:50,116
Nadia literally
keeps score.

560
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,368
She tallies everything.

561
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:54,770
She decided Elena's done more
bad things to her than good,

562
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:56,539
doesn't deserve
her affection.

563
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:57,657
I'm sure she's right.

564
00:23:01,611 --> 00:23:03,099
Unlike everybody else
in the world,

565
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,340
her memory seems to let her keep

566
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,946
a pure and objective view of people
in realtionships.

567
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,285
There's no petty
emotions or agendas

568
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:10,420
fogging the windshield.

569
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:11,471
Why is that so wrong?

570
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:13,222
'Cause it's
making her die alone

571
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,557
of kidney failure
in room 205?

572
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:15,725
Not necessarily.

573
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,126
Nadia's sister's
not like her.

574
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:19,312
I'm sure she's got plenty
of subjective emotions

575
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,480
we can exploit.

576
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:21,931
Why don't you go
channel your guilt,

577
00:23:21,982 --> 00:23:23,466
see if you can get her
to cough up a kidney?

578
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:24,612
Me?

579
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:26,312
I'm not good at that type of thing.

580
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:27,487
Someone else should go.

581
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:29,822
Someone else
didn't screw this up.

582
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:31,294
I didn't!

583
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:32,594
You were just obeying orders.
Right?

584
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,694
Go fix this.

585
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:36,863
Wha--

586
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:44,504
I didn't mean
to make you hate her.

587
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:47,940
And...Now that her
kidneys have failed, I--

588
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:53,429
I've always been a book
and equations person.

589
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:56,015
People are problematic.

590
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,919
And...random and messy.

591
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:03,005
Um, and with sisters...

592
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:04,857
I mean, I had a cousin

593
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:06,342
who I was close to,

594
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:07,894
and when our
menstrual cycles synced,

595
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:10,346
it was like
gladiator school--

596
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:12,865
Do you want me to donate
a kidney to my sister?

597
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:15,351
Yes.

598
00:24:18,072 --> 00:24:19,038
Okay.

599
00:24:19,106 --> 00:24:21,357
Really?

600
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:25,328
It might not fix
your relationship.

601
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:26,746
Uh, probably shouldn't
have said that.

602
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,581
Your left, on your left.

603
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:29,582
<i>Stop whining already.</i>

604
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,367
<i>I was getting a sniper.</i>

605
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:32,668
<i>Five minutes left</i>
<i>in the break.</i>

606
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:35,088
But the next level's
just past the cooling tanks.

607
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:36,355
That was the deal.

608
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:37,507
We take this break,
you do a practice test.

609
00:24:43,097 --> 00:24:46,149
I-I didn't
have the flu.

610
00:24:46,216 --> 00:24:48,884
I just...choked.

611
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:57,243
You make life and death
decisions

612
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,078
every day.

613
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:00,780
You work for House.

614
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:02,865
You're under constant pressure,
and you never choke.

615
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:05,901
I got a perfect score

616
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:08,955
on my first
pathology boards.

617
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,241
I kept thinking,
"whatever my score is now,

618
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:15,294
"it's going to be a measure
of the distance

619
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:18,848
between me and the man
I used to be."

620
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:20,933
You gotta stop
psyching yourself out.

621
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:22,585
<i>Well, the last test</i>

622
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:25,938
was before I lost my wife
and my home,

623
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,924
so I'm sure the next one
will go much better.

624
00:25:43,574 --> 00:25:45,708
Sometimes, I wake up
in the middle of the night,

625
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:47,827
and I can't sleep
for hours

626
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:49,896
'cause I'm worried I got
the diagnosis wrong.

627
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,084
These things work out.

628
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:07,313
We found a donor.

629
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:09,131
It's your sister.

630
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:11,918
Just thought you should know.

631
00:26:45,168 --> 00:26:48,688
Nadia, can you hear me?

632
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:50,306
You're coming out
of your anesthesia.

633
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:52,308
You're gonna feel
a bit groggy.

634
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:55,561
You did great.

635
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:57,897
Everything's looking good.

636
00:26:57,981 --> 00:26:59,482
Nadia, come on now.

637
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:00,516
Open your eyes.

638
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:06,322
Three milligrams
of lorazepam,

639
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:07,473
and I'm going
to need suction.

640
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:15,207
Seizures mean the steroids
aren't working.

641
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,458
And we got
the tests back.

642
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,992
We were wrong.
It's not autoimmune.

643
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:19,661
Could be acute porphyria.

644
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:21,346
No abdominal pain.

645
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:26,351
Did the patient
thank her sister?

646
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,386
Not yet, at least.

647
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,720
See if she will.

648
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:29,688
What are you trying
to find out?

649
00:27:29,772 --> 00:27:31,005
<i>If she's telling the truth.</i>

650
00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:34,008
She claims she objectively
sees reality.

651
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,510
Weighing the good
and bad in people.

652
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:36,978
<i>If that's true,</i>

653
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:38,146
<i>i don't care</i>
<i>how many times her sister</i>

654
00:27:38,197 --> 00:27:40,014
borrowed her scrunchie
without asking,

655
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:42,150
a free kidney ought
to trump all the bad stuff.

656
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:43,485
And if it doesn't?

657
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,971
That means she sucks,
like the rest of us.

658
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,289
<i>We haven't considered</i>
<i>her blood.</i>

659
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:49,660
Clots could hit her leg,
heart, kidney, and brain.

660
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:51,308
<i>Factor v leiden.</i>

661
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:53,510
Easiest to treat,
if we're right.

662
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:55,078
Start her on heparin.

663
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:56,980
And ask for the thank-you.

664
00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:02,152
How'd I do?

665
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:03,787
Great.

666
00:28:03,854 --> 00:28:05,122
Great?

667
00:28:05,189 --> 00:28:06,256
How great?

668
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:07,224
How many did I miss?

669
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,291
It's not about the numbers.

670
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,325
Don't...

671
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:11,027
54%?

672
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:12,428
Th-they make
the practice tests

673
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:13,830
harder than
the actual exam.

674
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:15,899
Oh, my God, now I'm choking
in your living room.

675
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:17,367
This isn't gonna work.

676
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:18,534
Who are you calling?

677
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:19,870
I found the guy.

678
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:22,371
He can sell me a copy
of the test.

679
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,672
I know it's cheating,

680
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:26,075
and I suck as a person.

681
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:28,711
But...the test
is tomorrow morning.

682
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:31,047
It's not about the cheating.
It's about your confidence.

683
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:34,350
You steal that test,
and you'll never get it back.

684
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,718
I can't handle

685
00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:37,419
failing at one more thing
in my life.

686
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:41,857
You're a good doctor.

687
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:43,158
I've seen what
you're capable of.

688
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:45,093
You're fast, you're decisive,
and you're bold.

689
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:47,028
And those are not
the qualities of someone

690
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:48,529
who needs to steal a test.

691
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:50,464
There's nothing on it
that you don't already know.

692
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:52,901
You just need to know
that you know it.

693
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:54,002
Keep talking.

694
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,437
We need you on the team.

695
00:28:56,505 --> 00:28:58,939
So we're gonna sit here
and take another practice test

696
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:00,007
and we're gonna
keep taking them

697
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:02,043
until you've
kicked its ass!

698
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,146
You can do this!
You feel me?

699
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:06,413
Yeah.

700
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:29,903
I feel like we just
buried a hooker in the desert.

701
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:31,170
There'll definitely
be another time

702
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:32,839
to rise up
and turn things around.

703
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:33,940
You'll come back from it.

704
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:35,341
Next time.

705
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,352
How are you feeling?

706
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,554
N-not any better.

707
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:52,858
It'll take some time
for the clots to resolve.

708
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:56,194
Your sister's
recovering well.

709
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:59,331
If you're really adding up
the good and bad...

710
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,436
Can I see her?

711
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,808
<i>Too fat.</i>

712
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,409
<i>Too thin.</i>

713
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,044
<i>Too desperate.</i>

714
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:15,113
<i>Not desperate enough.</i>

715
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,649
Come on, you can
insult them too.

716
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:19,984
I'd rather not.

717
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,351
If you objectify them now,

718
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,253
you'll feel more
comfortable when you...

719
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,223
Tie them to a table
in your basement later.

720
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,726
Or whatever.

721
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,560
Okay.

722
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,096
Um...

723
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,897
<i>Too armpit fatty.</i>

724
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,266
<i>Whoa! Too hot.</i>

725
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,635
<i>I actually know her.</i>

726
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:40,837
She's the new barista
at my coffee shop.

727
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:42,238
She's getting her masters
in finance.

728
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:43,439
<i>Brains and boobs.</i>

729
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:44,607
The mother lode.

730
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:46,308
<i>Total moron</i>
<i>as a barista, though.</i>

731
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:47,677
Every drink I order

732
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,678
ends up with
whipped cream on it.

733
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,613
Even when I say no whip.

734
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,617
Girlfriend, that means
she's into you.

735
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:57,252

Hi.

763
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:09,187
Thank you.

764
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:10,787
For saving my life.

765
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:12,889
I love you, you know.

766
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:19,162
I was thinking
about those times

767
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,698
we went up to Spofford Lake
in the summer.

768
00:32:24,268 --> 00:32:25,468
Whenever we took out
the canoe,

769
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:27,569
you'd tie up
my life vest for me.

770
00:32:27,637 --> 00:32:30,505
In the afternoon,
sneak me into the lodge

771
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,941
so we could steal popsicles.

772
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:38,147
Maybe we could go back.

773
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:41,183
I could drive us up there.
We could get a cabin and--

774
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:45,120
And maybe rent a canoe.

775
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:46,821
<i>Oh, wow, I haven't...</i>

776
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:48,257
Thought of Spofford in...

777
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:51,893
<i>Nadia...</i>

778
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:54,996
Are you okay?

779
00:32:55,064 --> 00:32:57,666
Elena, I'm sorry!
I can't do this!

780
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:13,247
Can you stop?

781
00:33:13,315 --> 00:33:14,815
Just stop pushing me
for a minute.

782
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:22,455
I understand now

783
00:33:22,523 --> 00:33:24,223
why you stuck yourself
in that diner,

784
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:27,294
away from friends,
away from family.

785
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:32,464
You can't forgive anyone.

786
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,199
I don't think
you weigh anything.

787
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:36,001
I think you're like
a lot of people.

788
00:33:36,068 --> 00:33:38,370
You focus on
the bad memories

789
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:40,639
instead of the good.

790
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:43,475
I don't have a choice.

791
00:33:47,046 --> 00:33:49,781
Nadia, put your hand
in your lap for a moment.

792
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:55,787
I'm not doing that.
<i>I know.</i>

793
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:58,456
It's an involuntary movement
called choreia.

794
00:33:58,524 --> 00:34:00,124
What does it mean?

795
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:02,527
It means we still don't know
what's wrong with you.

796
00:34:13,826 --> 00:34:15,326
Thank you.

797
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,366
Do you know if that...
O.R. nurse that Wilson liked

798
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:24,434
ever broke up
with her boyfriend?

799
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:26,369
I thought your Wilson fetish
was over.

800
00:34:26,437 --> 00:34:28,105
I'm putting together
a second string

801
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:29,639
in case things
don't go well

802
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,241
with the well-breasted
barista.

803
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:33,376
You've gotta
let that guy alone.

804
00:34:33,444 --> 00:34:35,979
He's not supposed
to be alone.

805
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:37,347
Is that what this is about?

806
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:38,648
You feel guilty because

807
00:34:38,716 --> 00:34:42,051
Wilson's the one
that's alone and not you?

808
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,820
You still don't think
you deserve this.

809
00:34:45,723 --> 00:34:47,289
Have you met me?

810
00:34:47,357 --> 00:34:50,893
Your happiness
doesn't take his away.

811
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:52,661
It's okay to enjoy it.

812
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:00,235
Yeah.

813
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:02,303
Choreia. Rules out
the clotting disorder.

814
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:03,605
Means we're back
to square one.

815
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:04,773
If it's hit
her brain,

816
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:05,941
that could mean
she doesn't have long.

817
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:07,876
So then the question becomes,

818
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:09,477
will the sister
show up at the funeral?

819
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:11,311
She tried to reconcile,

820
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:13,614
but the bad memories crowded out
the good, and she ran.

821
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:14,715
Nobody's perfect.

822
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:16,217
<i>What else?</i>

823
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:21,387
<i>Come on, the woman has</i>
<i>all the information we need.</i>

824
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,890
She's a bottomless
diagnostic library.

825
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,925
<i>Maybe we're missing something</i>
<i>from the apartment.</i>

826
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:27,127
Some lifestyle thing.

827
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:28,594
Yeah, it's all
muscle strain

828
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,797
from doing her hundreds
of Jigsaw puzzles.

829
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:32,098
<i>We should do</i>
<i>another MRI.</i>

830
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:33,066
<i>A brain hemorrhage would--</i>

831
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:35,300
Hey.

832
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:36,301
How many puzzles?

833
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:38,170
Okay, I was exaggerating.

834
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:39,171
Dozens.

835
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:43,308
Do a peripheral blood smear.

836
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:44,442
Look for acanthocytes.

837
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,677
I'll be right in.

838
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,849
Remember me?

839
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,751
Just kidding.

840
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,888
So...Jigsaw puzzles.

841
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,392
Um, I find them calming.

842
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,360
<i>You ever left one unfinished?</i>

843
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:06,263
No, that would
drive me crazy.

844
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,898
Speaking of...

845
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,139
Why are you
doing that?

846
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,041
More important question is,
why are you?

847
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,342
It's just a habit.

848
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,344
It's a habit
that compels you

849
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,079
in an obsessive way

850
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:26,182
that's so bad,
it's a disorder.

851
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:27,516
I don't have OCD.

852
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:28,717
Each brain with OCD

853
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,452
has its own way
of filtering it.

854
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,687
<i>Some people</i>
<i>wash their hands</i>

855
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,088
<i>and hoard</i> tv guides.

856
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:36,558
You do puzzles
and hoard memories.

857
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:40,362
So what we thought
was a gift...

858
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:45,667
Is just you literally
obsessing over your own life.

859
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:47,369
That's why I can't
stop the memories,

860
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:48,837
even when I try.

861
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:52,641
But everything else?

862
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:53,842
My kidneys?

863
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:56,043
Memory was just
a symptom of a symptom

864
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,346
of a larger disease.

865
00:36:58,413 --> 00:36:59,580
You have McLeod syndrome.

866
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:00,981
It's a rare
genetic disorder

867
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:04,117
that affects
the nervous system, the blood.

868
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:08,188
And can cause...

869
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:10,590
OCD.

870
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:13,926
Am I gonna die?

871
00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:15,928
It can't be cured.

872
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:19,932
But your various symptoms
can be managed with medication.

873
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:25,271
Best-case scenario,

874
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:26,339
you can live
another 20 years.

875
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:34,580
If it's any solace,

876
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:36,849
everybody dies alone.

877
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,421
It probably isn't.

878
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:54,064
How'd it go?

879
00:37:54,132 --> 00:37:55,533
Well, it's hard to choke

880
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:57,935
when you have
all the answers.

881
00:37:58,003 --> 00:37:59,269
Look at it this way.

882
00:37:59,336 --> 00:38:01,070
It's better to suck
at taking one test

883
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:04,173
than to suck at
saving people's lives.

884
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,842
Wow.

885
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,644
<i>Uh, Rachel thought</i>
<i>it was too big,</i>

886
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:09,112
and I can't keep it
in my hotel room.

887
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,180
You're giving it to me?

888
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,482
I couldn't
stand the thought

889
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,550
of you having company over

890
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:15,718
with that other TV.

891
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:16,952
It's embarrassing.

892
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:20,389
Thanks.

893
00:38:22,158 --> 00:38:24,693
Thank you.

894
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,834
Hey, look, um...

895
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:34,736
I have the room.

896
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:36,504
You could stay,
if you wanted to.

897
00:38:36,572 --> 00:38:39,006
Just until you
find your new place.

898
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:41,676
Who else am I gonna play
<i>savageskate</i> with?

899
00:38:41,744 --> 00:38:45,346
We could do that online
from separate houses.

900
00:38:45,414 --> 00:38:46,580
Will you shut up?

901
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,182
Okay.

902
00:38:57,325 --> 00:38:58,559
How you feeling?

903
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:02,062
Much better.

904
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:05,397
I don't believe
what House said.

905
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:09,435
I'm not sure even House
believes it anymore.

906
00:39:09,503 --> 00:39:11,804
You said you didn't
have a choice

907
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,039
to be the way you are.

908
00:39:14,107 --> 00:39:15,875
Now you do.

909
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:17,743
These are ssris.

910
00:39:17,811 --> 00:39:20,111
They've been effective
in treating OCD.

911
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:21,813
You mean lose my memory?

912
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,247
Not lose it entirely.

913
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:24,883
It'll just become
more like anyone else's.

914
00:39:27,854 --> 00:39:31,022
My memory...

915
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,724
Is the only thing

916
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:35,893
that has ever
made me special.

917
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:39,630
Maybe so.

918
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:43,033
But if you want
to be special...

919
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:46,203
You're gonna
have to be alone.

920
00:40:05,422 --> 00:40:06,255
Ohh!

921
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:17,666
Ohh!

922
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:23,538
Hey.
Aah!

923
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,574
Those are for Sarah.

924
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:28,442
Are they poisoned?

925
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,377
Poi--

926
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:32,413
you and your paranoia.

927
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,381
Now, if you'll excuse me...

928
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:39,118
I really should find
a better place

929
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,955
to store my ragweed.

930
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,122
<i>It's a very nice gesture,</i>

931
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,658
but it's still
in the apartment.

932
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:04,409
So...I wanna hear

933
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:07,345
all the dirty,
dairy-specific details

934
00:41:07,413 --> 00:41:09,414
of your night
with java the slut.

935
00:41:09,482 --> 00:41:11,082
All right.

936
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:13,117
First of all,

937
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:14,318
all real.

938
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:16,120
Second...

939
00:41:16,188 --> 00:41:18,623
A true connoisseur

940
00:41:18,691 --> 00:41:21,158
of the dark arts of...

941
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,529
I flaked.

942
00:41:25,598 --> 00:41:27,598
I walked her to her car
and said good night.

943
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:30,100
I will get back into it, I--

944
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,703
you just need to give me
a little more time.

945
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:41,645
I'll give you ten days.

946
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:48,017
Fine.

947
00:41:54,524 --> 00:41:55,691
