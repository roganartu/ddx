Taub's got his money on Wilson,

creditors...

39
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:48,217
She needs a doctor.

40
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:50,253
Yes, just not me.

41
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:51,953
Your mom is
a 65-year-old woman

42
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,322
<i>with high</i>
<i>blood pressure.</i>

43
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,147
- What about the macrocytic anemia?
- Borderline,

44
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,759
which is the lab equivalent
of imaginary,

45
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,227
which, by the way,
matches the rest

46
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:00,695
of her medical history.

47
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,898
You really think
she's psyching herself

48
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:05,600
into atrial fibrillation?
So get her a cardiologist.

49
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,102
You don't want me
involved.

50
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,436
You don't want
<i>you</i> involved.

51
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,872
All that ethics stuff
that I don't give a crap about

52
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,140
suddenly makes sense.

53
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,708
<i>If you're</i>
<i>emotionally invested,</i>

54
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,410
<i>you cannot make</i>
<i>rational decisions.</i>

55
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:18,680
You know this would be
a disaster.

56
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:21,583
This is my mother.

57
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:26,017
Treadmill test
went well--

58
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:27,718
no chest discomfort
or ischemia.

59
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,455
<i>The abnormal rhythm</i>
<i>will probably resolve itself,</i>

60
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:32,890
and if not, a daily pill
will keep it under control.

61
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,059
I will follow up
later today.

62
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:36,294
Is it connected
to my other symptoms?

63
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,397
Which other symptoms, mom?

64
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:41,899
Aye...
Not her fault.

65
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,201
This "Dean
of Medicine" stuff--

66
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:46,037
<i>very impressive at parties.</i>

67
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:48,573
But she's forgotten
how to be a real doctor.

68
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,242
It's all in my file.

69
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,444
There are 15 years
of clinic visits in this file.

70
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:55,546
<i>I don't want to be</i>
<i>a bother.</i>

71
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:58,716
But isn't this what
you do for a living?

72
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,423
So...

73
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:07,892
We're looking for a disease that
can last a decade and a half,

74
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,262
<i>causes constipation,</i>
<i>diarrhea, flu, cold,</i>

75
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,498
<i>dizziness, rashes,</i>
<i>back and joint pain,</i>

76
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:16,167
"heart feeling weird,"

77
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:17,602
"kishkes feeling wobbly,"

78
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,370
one actual hip replacement.

79
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:22,206
<i>And which has eluded detection</i>
<i>by years of blood work,</i>

80
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,941
X-rays, and MRIs.

81
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,010
Well, one thing does
pop to mind.

82
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,278
We'll monitor you,

83
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:28,946
and we'll give you
a thyroid test.

84
00:03:29,014 --> 00:03:30,481
And House's team
will do a home search

85
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:31,682
for environmental toxins.

86
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,952
He seems to know his stuff.

87
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,121
How come he can't afford
a coat that fits?

88
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:41,116
<i>No radon, no mold,</i>
<i>no lead in the pipes.</i>

89
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,287
Yeah, yeah, great. Have you seen
Cuddy's high-school yearbook?

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,421
Okay, that is clearly
not related to the case.

91
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:46,589
There is no case.

92
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:48,991
Cuddy won't let House
see the yearbook,

93
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:50,392
<i>so he figures</i>
<i>there's something to hide.</i>

94
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,628
Any guesses?
It's clearly related

95
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:55,397
to being a giant
teenage dork.

96
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:57,299
So you thought I'd have
some insights.

97
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:58,634
Oh, no, no.

98
00:03:58,702 --> 00:03:59,835
- I didn't mean.
- Relax.

99
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:01,570
I was crowned
homecoming geek.

100
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:06,242
I'm sure
you can relate...

101
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:09,511
Because you knew
some dorks.

102
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,414
I was the class president
and head boy at--

103
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:13,449
aah!

104
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,020
Oh...

105
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:19,688
Is that--
is that Cuddy's mom?

106
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:21,857
Certain parts of her...

107
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:26,462
And certain parts of some
muscular Hispanic gentleman.

108
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:27,796
Should we consider STDs?

109
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:29,865
I think I just caught one
looking at these photos.

110
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:32,835
What does "azarcon" mean?

111
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:34,436
I--

112
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,873
it means we might have
an actual case.

113
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:40,709
Mexican herbal medication
for stomach problems,

114
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:43,178
but only in the sense
that lead chromate is an herb

115
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:44,413
and poison
is a medication.

116
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:47,182
I'll start a chelation I.V.
Thank you so much.

117
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,551
That wasn't too much
of a disaster, was it?

118
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:52,154
You know...

119
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,757
That's not the only thing
they found in her home.

120
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:57,092
Not my yearbook...

121
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,694
Nope.

122
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:00,095
Just some stuff
that could cause

123
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:03,232
severe nausea and permanent
erectile dysfunction...

124
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,669
And which proves that
your mom is doing the help.

125
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:11,106
According to her diary, it's
some contractor named Jesus...

126
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:14,910
Which, granted, was originally
a Jewish name, but...

127
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:17,680
Go, mom.

128
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:26,789
So...

129
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:29,658
Why were you taking
a Mexican folk remedy?

130
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:32,628
A friend uses it.

131
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:33,796
A friend?

132
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:35,931
Mom...

133
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,100
Just for medical reasons,
you should have told me.

134
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,368
If you're sexually active--

135
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:43,772
at my age, he's more
the active one.

136
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,007
Mom's having a fling.

137
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:46,575
I know.

138
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:47,976
You do?

139
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:50,245
She's been giving me
lousy advice about it

140
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:52,348
for five years.

141
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:54,350
- I have physical needs.
- He's a married man, mom.

142
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:55,718
She doesn't want sex
with him.

143
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:57,286
I do want
to have sex with him.

144
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:58,721
Tell me,
who's being hurt?

145
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:00,622
Hold on.
Five years?

146
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,925
- Why didn't you tell me about it?
- I don't know.

147
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,861
We don't have
that kind of relationship.

148
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,601
Does that really
surprise you?

149
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:20,809
You said you had two guys
helping you move.

150
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:22,478
They couldn't get
out of work.

151
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:25,481
I'm trying
to economize.

152
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:28,016
This hotel's cheap.

153
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:29,251
Hi.

154
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,587
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to drop off some mail

155
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:32,988
and talk to you
about something.

156
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,423
Of course.

157
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:47,727
Rache...

158
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:51,197
Chris,
that's not why.

159
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:54,406
We got to move on.

160
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:56,542
What does that mean?

161
00:06:56,609 --> 00:07:00,112
Have you moved on?

162
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,747
With who?
Is it Phil?

163
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:03,282
I don't want to talk
about this.

164
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:06,718
I know that you're worried
about money.

165
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:09,021
- You're trying to change the subject.
- Yeah,

166
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,556
which you
could have gleaned

167
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:12,224
from, "I don't want to talk
about this."

168
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:14,760
I got you a tryout

169
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:17,796
to be a part-time medical
consultant on lawsuits.

170
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:20,766
Wait, with your brother?

171
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:23,669
Have you completely forgotten
the last time I saw him?

172
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,004
That was five years ago.

173
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,073
Jamie had just found out
that you'd been cheating on me

174
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:29,508
<i>with your partner's</i>
<i>daughter.</i>

175
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:30,943
It's a little overreaction.
My--

176
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,945
he broke my nose
and then called me

177
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:36,014
the most horrible person
he's ever met.

178
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:40,219
He shouldn't have broken
your nose.

179
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:04,176
You know, texts,
calls, and emails

180
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:06,311
all go to the same magic device
these days.

181
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,980
You only got to send one.

182
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,681
Then it's even weirder

183
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,617
it took you so long
to get down here.

184
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:14,520
Yeah, that's
a crazy mystery.

185
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,488
It's not like I got
a department to run.

186
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:21,793
This other magic device
tells me that lead poisoning

187
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:24,897
wouldn't cause all my symptoms.
True.

188
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:30,068
But it could cause
the 5% that are real.

189
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,638
You think
I'm a hypochondriac?

190
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:35,107
Well, let me answer this way--
maybe you're imagining

191
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:36,909
that I think
you're a hypochondriac.

192
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:40,412
Look, my hand
just started to shake.

193
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,215
It's a side effect
of these arthritis pills.

194
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:44,583
Read the label.

195
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:47,286
I did...
When I was typing it up,

196
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:50,422
right before I slapped it
on a bottle of sugar pills.

197
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,092
You printed
a fake label...

198
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,461
Just to prove
I'm a hypochondriac?

199
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:57,863
Did it work?

200
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:02,000
It got you fired,
you schmuck.

201
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,839
An hour to convince her
to go with Dr. Kaufman,

202
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:11,043
and only then because
he runs internal medicine.

203
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,678
She wanted to leave
the hospital entirely.

204
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:14,913
My God, a woman
getting better

205
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,415
wants to leave
the hospital?

206
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,250
If she's getting better,
it's not because

207
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,085
you made her feel like a fool.
It couldn't be more because.

208
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:21,587
If I hadn't,
she'd have diagnosed herself

209
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:22,754
with six new forms
of cancer.

210
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:24,056
<i>She'd never leave.</i>

211
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:26,091
It's hard enough dealing
with my mom being sick.

212
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,895
This juvenile--

213
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:31,496
Yeah?

214
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:33,165
Lisa, it's gonna be okay,

215
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,967
but she's in a-fib at 170.
<i>Oh, God.</i>

216
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,302
<i>I think we should cardiovert</i>
<i>while she's unsedated.</i>

217
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,137
I'll be right there.

218
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:42,341
A-fib's at 170.

219
00:09:42,408 --> 00:09:43,642
Wait.

220
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,444
I'm sorry she's sick.

221
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,112
I'm not sorry
I'm off the case.

222
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,280
You're not off the case.

223
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:50,582
You don't think
you can convince her--

224
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,584
no, no.
You are staying on.

225
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:55,420
She just can't know
about it.

226
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:01,639
Top of the morning,
Dr. Kaufman.

227
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:03,374
Here's the deal.

228
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,109
You copy me
on all the imaging.

229
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:07,945
- I'll have my guys run the lab tests.
- No.

230
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,247
I thought you spoke
to Cuddy.

231
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:11,449
Yeah. Then I spoke
to the elder Cuddy,

232
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:15,019
who specifically requested
you not be involved.

233
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:18,389
Listen, Kauffy,
you are perfectly competent,

234
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:19,724
bordering
on good, even.

235
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,392
But you know I'm better.

236
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,894
If you want,
we can pretend it's 'cause

237
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,395
I got a team
and more resources.

238
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:26,597
Either way, it'd be crazy
to ignore my advice.

239
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,232
It's not gonna stop
at advice.

240
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,834
You're gonna start
cutting me out,

241
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:31,235
go behind me
to your girlfriend.

242
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:32,637
And if something
goes wrong,

243
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:35,006
still me standing up there
alone at the M&M.

244
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,607
Please...

245
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:38,743
Stay away
from my patient.

246
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,484
<i>Which button?</i>

247
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:48,086
<i>The one by your right hand</i>

248
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:50,154
<i>with the design of the bed</i>
<i>next to it and the arrows</i>

249
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:51,789
<i>pointing up or down.</i>
You bugged the room?

250
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:55,059
I absolutely,
without apology, will admit

251
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,261
that someone may have
allegedly done so.

252
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:58,529
<i>Guess we can pass</i>
<i>unethical</i>

253
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:00,965
and skip straight
to illegal.

254
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,934
Not according to the recent
Supreme Court case

255
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,769
of bite versus me.

256
00:11:04,837 --> 00:11:06,270
<i>Dr. Kaufman's single.</i>

257
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,106
<i>Did you know he went</i>
<i>to Harvard Medical School?</i>

258
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:11,442
<i>Mom, stop yenta-ing</i>
<i>for one minute!</i>

259
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,544
<i>If you want gloomy</i>
<i>and unable to commit,</i>

260
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:15,146
<i>then stick</i>
<i>with the</i> goyishe <i>one.</i>

261
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:17,215
This is completely unethical.
Why are we listening to this?

262
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:19,550
I know I'm a pain,
but it's impossible

263
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:22,019
for me to work with you
if you-- fine, fine!

264
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,155
Instead of a live stream,
I'll get a recap from Cuddy

265
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:26,190
20 minutes later--
thank you for saving America.

266
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:28,659
Could be leukemia.

267
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:30,361
Anemia from
taking over the marrow,

268
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:33,197
<i>a-fib from infiltrating</i>
<i>cardiac muscle.</i>

269
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:35,833
Sounds good.

270
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:38,536
Yeah.

271
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:41,606
I was really hoping
for a different diagnosis--

272
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:43,908
one that Kaufman hadn't
already come up with.

273
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:46,310
He just started
a bone-marrow biopsy.

274
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:48,446
So we don't need to do anything.
<i>I don't.</i>

275
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:50,548
You do. Go to admitting.
Find us a new case.

276
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:03,628
Psst! Whaa!

277
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,802
Ddx.

278
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,503
Um, we just did it.

279
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,338
No, we just did
the fake one.

280
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:16,874
Why do you think I let the
truth fairy know about the bug?

281
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:18,910
<i>I was testing her.</i>
<i>She failed.</i>

282
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:20,411
She's still a narc.

283
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,448
<i>Thiamine deficiency</i>
<i>fits better than leukemia.</i>

284
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,917
You think she's
an alcoholic?

285
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:28,686
I had dinner with Arlene.
I mixed her a gin and tonic.

286
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:31,022
And I'd run
out of the tonic,

287
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:32,924
so I substituted
sleeping pills.

288
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:34,592
<i>Next morning,</i>
<i>she assumed</i>

289
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,028
<i>the blackout was</i>
<i>from the drinking.</i>

290
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:39,897
How many old ladies are used
to passing out from boozing?

291
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:43,868
The answer is the boozers.

292
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:46,604
We're gonna have to slip her
the thiamine pills.

293
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,809
We've got to run this
by Cuddy.

294
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:55,980
Why do you think
I'm in such a bad mood?

295
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:04,489
Alcoholic?

296
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:08,426
Treatment's very easy,

297
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:10,495
safe.

298
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:12,864
It's literally
a few vitamin pills.

299
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:14,532
It'll fix her heart,

300
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,335
and it won't interfere with
the biopsy Kaufman's running.

301
00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:20,972
Put 'em
in an antacid bottle.

302
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,040
Just tell her
it's for stomach problems.

303
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:30,848
I have to ask her
about this.

304
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,118
Of course.
Absolutely.

305
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,453
You'll ask.
She'll deny.

306
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:37,288
You'll push it.
She'll get offended.

307
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:38,723
<i>You'll be exactly</i>
<i>where you are now,</i>

308
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,391
<i>except it'll be</i>
<i>harder to treat.</i>

309
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:41,626
You've absolutely
got to do that.

310
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:42,927
I don't think
she'll lie to me.

311
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:45,997
She just spent
the last five years

312
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,799
going south of the border
down Mexico way.

313
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,902
We have our issues,
but since dad died,

314
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:54,972
we tell each other the truth
when asked directly.

315
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,409
It's important to us.

316
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:03,114
Addicts lie.

317
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:18,930
Can I speak
to mom alone?

318
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,333
Why?

319
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:29,206
You're scaring me,
Lisa.

320
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:33,578
Mom, I think your drinking
is causing your heart problems.

321
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,948
Is this about the champagne?
She ordered--

322
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:42,153
patsy and Anne
told me last week

323
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,255
<i>you lost control</i>
<i>at the museum luncheon.</i>

324
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:46,824
You're talking to my friends
behind my back.

325
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:50,261
We are all concerned.
Just tell me honestly...

326
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,929
How much have you
been drinking?

327
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,836
I may be your patient,
but I am still your mother.

328
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:02,373
And I'm telling you
I am not a drunk.

329
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:11,482
Okay.

330
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:24,762
For your stomach pains.

331
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:52,523
If something like that
comes up again, just...

332
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:53,958
Do what you need
to do.

333
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:56,494
And keep you out of it?
<i>Yeah.</i>

334
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:59,330
I am being a coward,

335
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:01,232
which is exactly why
doctors shouldn't treat

336
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,800
their own families.

337
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:04,669
Congratulations.

338
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:06,971
You were right,
as usual.

339
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:14,111
The hitting you
was not optimal.

340
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,881
I was going through
my own divorce at the time.

341
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:18,683
I have had years
of therapy.

342
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,084
Now when I get mad,

343
00:16:20,152 --> 00:16:23,087
I do some deep breathing,
squeeze my stress ball.

344
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:26,190
Hey, I kind of
deserved it.

345
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:28,626
That's for sure.

346
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:30,661
Here's the deal.

347
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,963
I do a lot
of med-mal insurance.

348
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:34,665
I need a new
non-testifying expert.

349
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,233
I'll give you one case
as a tryout.

350
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:37,635
You kick ass,
I put you on retainer.

351
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:40,671
Average 15 hours a week,
it's 50 a year.

352
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:42,940
50 what?

353
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:45,843
You kidding?
$50,000.

354
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:47,912
I'll take it.

355
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:50,081
You drive a soft bargain.

356
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:51,849
You got to sign
an N.D.A.

357
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:53,050
Sure.

358
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:55,319
Is this...?

359
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:57,421
Uh, that's a case
I'm about to settle.

360
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,990
I rep a giant
pizza-delivery company.

361
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:02,460
Driver hit that kid,
messed up his legs.

362
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:05,262
And gave him a microbleed
in his brain, right?

363
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,798
What? No.

364
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,333
This little white mark.

365
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:13,204
Your predecessor checked,
so did the kid's doctors.

366
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:16,173
I don't know what that is,
but he's fine.

367
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:19,543
Probably.
But if there's any doubt--

368
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:20,945
it's a
multimillion-dollar case.

369
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,413
We're settling
in two days.

370
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:24,148
Lay off it, okay?

371
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,150
Okay.
You're right.

372
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:28,519
I'm off.

373
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:41,932
She spiked a fever.
It's 102.

374
00:17:44,302 --> 00:17:46,670
That means I was wrong
about the thiamine deficiency.

375
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:48,639
You were wrong
about the alcoholism.

376
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:50,508
True dat.

377
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:52,910
It's actually looking
more and more like leukemia.

378
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:56,580
Kaufman rushed the biopsies.
It's not cancer.

379
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:59,083
So there's
a bright side...

380
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:01,819
Kaufman was wrong too.

381
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,566
Ddx.
Okay...

382
00:18:13,848 --> 00:18:15,649
What disease can turn
Cuddy's mother

383
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:18,285
into a coma patient
named Stewart?

384
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:19,320
Lupus?

385
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,491
We got fired from that case.
We're moving on.

386
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,760
We were already fired.
By the patient.

387
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:28,629
This time by Cuddy,
so it's real.

388
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:31,532
She somehow realized that
her completely unworkable system

389
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,567
was completely unworkable.

390
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:36,236
Okay, pop quiz,
hot shots--

391
00:18:36,304 --> 00:18:38,172
I chose vegetable stew
for a reason.

392
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:42,743
You got 60 seconds,
no "hintsies."

393
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:43,944
You're not gonna
talk to us?

394
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:45,579
Exactly.
You're gonna have to--hey!

395
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,147
You're good.

396
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:49,450
So this is just a test?

397
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:51,385
<i>Pupils fixed and dilated--</i>

398
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:53,354
an addict,

399
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:55,990
<i>found with an empty bottle</i>
<i>of phenobarb next to him.</i>

400
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:58,993
How is this a mystery?
It's an overdose.

401
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,094
Glutethimide!

402
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:01,929
<i>Script filled last year.</i>

403
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:04,765
Could mimic fixed and dilated
without the brain death...

404
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,635
Except he'll just get better
on his own,

405
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:09,770
so why would you take
this case?

406
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:11,271
Because House doesn't care
about the treatment

407
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:12,673
as long as the case
is interesting.

408
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:14,842
I'll do a blood draw

409
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:17,411
and put glutethimide
on the tox screen.

410
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:24,351
Really?

411
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,654
You thought that case
was interesting?

412
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:28,889
Oh, guess we're still
on Arlene.

413
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:31,191
Aren't there other ways
of keeping Masters occupied?

414
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,794
Not according to my
sexual harassment seminar.

415
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,199
Maybe it's not hypochondria.

416
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:40,534
She said she gets
a lot of rashes.

417
00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:41,735
Add the fever--

418
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:44,438
sounds like
autoimmune, S.L.E.

419
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:46,607
Congratulations,
you can think exactly like

420
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,542
a semi-competent
internist.

421
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,145
Kaufman's starting her
on prednisone.

422
00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:53,113
But the heart problems
were first.

423
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:55,416
Endocarditis.

424
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:56,750
With no murmurs?

425
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:58,952
It's usually a late sign.

426
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,287
Echo showed
pristine valves.

427
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:01,555
Below the resolving
threshold.

428
00:20:01,623 --> 00:20:03,524
Kaufman's prednisone

429
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:05,893
will suppress her
immune system--could kill her.

430
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:11,565
You got to tell him
it's endocarditis.

431
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:12,933
<i>Check the wiretap.</i>

432
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:15,436
His I.D. guy's been putting
the same argument to him.

433
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:17,871
He can't convince him.
You think I got a better shot?

434
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:19,139
So what do we do?

435
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:26,714
We switch her meds.

436
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:28,382
<i>We get a solution</i>
<i>of broad-spectrum antibiotics,</i>

437
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,585
<i>stick it in an I.V. bag</i>
<i>marked for prednisone.</i>

438
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:33,520
Kaufman can only be there
a few times a day.

439
00:20:33,588 --> 00:20:35,889
Tell Arlene you're from
the pharmacy, switch 'em out.

440
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:38,358
This is nuts.
This is way too complicated.

441
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:39,727
It's hanging an I.V. bag!

442
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:41,395
If the attending
doesn't know what she's on,

443
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:42,696
<i>the risk of drug reaction--</i>
What risk?

444
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:44,732
We know how he's treating her.
We bugged the room.

445
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,033
<i>This is not</i>
<i>about information!</i>

446
00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:47,868
We're talking ethical
and legal violations

447
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:49,636
on a scale that should make
even you puke!

448
00:20:49,704 --> 00:20:51,672
She's dying! That doesn't
mean we should all go to jail

449
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,806
to save her!

450
00:20:59,314 --> 00:21:02,616
You're losing control
because...

451
00:21:02,684 --> 00:21:06,353
This is your
girlfriend's mom.

452
00:21:06,421 --> 00:21:09,156
You gonna run this
by Cuddy?

453
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:10,557
No.

454
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,493
<i>She said to</i>
<i>keep her out of it,</i>

455
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,827
<i>do what we need to do.</i>

456
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:15,095
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>what I'm suggesting</i>

457
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:17,064
is completely screwed up.

458
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:18,332
That's because
this situation

459
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,167
<i>is completely screwed up.</i>

460
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:23,203
Do it, or you're fired.

461
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:30,244
We stick together,
he can't fire all three of us.

462
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,847
Give me a prescription pad.

463
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:35,849
Why are you doing this?

464
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,417
Because I think
it's endocarditis,

465
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:40,053
and I think the prednisone
will kill her.

466
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:42,556
Now, I forgot
my prescription pad.

467
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,235
<i>Am I a horrible person?</i>

468
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:58,338
I used to win awards
for volunteer work.

469
00:21:58,406 --> 00:22:01,008
I went to Guatemala
and fixed cleft palates.

470
00:22:01,075 --> 00:22:03,477
<i>Now we're sitting back</i>
<i>letting Chase</i>

471
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:05,913
do our dirty work.
We're doing the right thing--

472
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,915
stay out of it.
I don't know.

473
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:10,918
I don't know
about anything anymore.

474
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:15,289
Then this thing with the kid,
Rachel's brother--

475
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:16,790
stay out of that too.

476
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:19,927
A--radiologists--experts,
unlike you--said no bleed.

477
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:21,728
B--you yourself said
it's probably not.

478
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:24,097
C--you've got
no doctor-patient relationship.

479
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:25,833
D--you'll lose
your consulting job.

480
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,367
E--your ex will kill you.

481
00:22:27,435 --> 00:22:30,270
F--I'm running
out of alphabet here.

482
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:33,340
You do it?

483
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:35,342
Had the bag,
walking towards the room,

484
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,911
and Cuddy's sister says,
"hey, Dr. Chase."

485
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:39,947
<i>I met her at</i>
<i>that charity event last year.</i>

486
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:41,448
One of you two
has got to do this.

487
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:43,617
I met Arlene
at the same benefit.

488
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:44,885
<i>Conveniently.</i>

489
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:46,920
Come on, don't ask me.

490
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:48,689
I don't even know
if I believe it's endo--

491
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:52,159
Damn it.
It's Rachel's brother.

492
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:53,794
He wants me to check out
some new case.

493
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:56,864
Conveniently.

494
00:22:56,931 --> 00:23:00,067
It's a tryout.
I need this job.

495
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:02,803
I got to do this.

496
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:04,338
So you're just gonna
ditch us, run off,

497
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:05,472
and work
on some other case?

498
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:19,119
Are you Timothy's mom?

499
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:21,021
Yeah.
My name is Christopher Taub.

500
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,358
I'm a doctor
at Princeton Plainsboro.

501
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:25,826
I saw your son's file.

502
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:28,629
I think he might have
a very small bleed in his brain.

503
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:31,298
Wait, you--
you saw his file?

504
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,100
H-how do you even know
who we are? I--

505
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,903
your son could die
of a brain hemorrhage.

506
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,704
He needs a cerebral
angiogram today.

507
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:40,307
Get in your car and meet me
at the hospital.

508
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:46,346
Timothy, we're gonna go see
the doctor.

509
00:23:50,891 --> 00:23:52,325
Another pop quiz.

510
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:55,495
How many idiot doctors
does it take to switch an I.V.?

511
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:58,398
<i>The longer we wait,</i>

512
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:00,900
the more the prednisone
is gonna kill her immune system.

513
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:02,502
Forget playing pharmacist.

514
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,437
<i>Mom naps every afternoon.</i>
<i>Wait by the room.</i>

515
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:06,673
When she falls asleep,
get the sister out somehow.

516
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:14,881
Hi, Dr. Cuddy, is now
a good time to talk?

517
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:16,916
Not really.

518
00:24:16,984 --> 00:24:19,152
So, um, you know
how you had us consulting

519
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,920
and then stopped
having us consult?

520
00:24:20,988 --> 00:24:23,490
Why are you still here?

521
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:25,325
Um, well,
I think the stopping

522
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:27,961
might have stopped.

523
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:29,763
<i>House put me</i>
<i>on this weird case</i>

524
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,331
<i>where there's</i>
<i>no treatment--</i>

525
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:33,299
I think maybe
to distract me.

526
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:34,968
Uh, and they've been
acting odd.

527
00:24:35,035 --> 00:24:37,203
I'll look into it.

528
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:38,905
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for coming to me.</i>

529
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:41,474
Because I'm--I'm worried
that he's switching

530
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:43,943
your mother's medications.

531
00:24:44,011 --> 00:24:46,646
<i>I checked</i>
<i>with the pharmacy--</i>

532
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:49,115
<i>Dr. Chase got prednisone</i>
<i>and antibiotics</i>

533
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:51,417
<i>for my coma patient,</i>
<i>which wouldn't treat him,</i>

534
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:54,220
<i>but could treat conditions</i>
<i>that cause...</i>

535
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:57,357
Heart failure.

536
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:04,364
You told me to keep you out
of it, do what I needed to do.

537
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:06,366
What the hell
did you think that meant?

538
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:07,867
I meant, like, if you had
to slip her

539
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:09,068
a few more vitamin pills
or something.

540
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:10,537
This is life-threatening!

541
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:12,505
It's illegal.

542
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:14,140
I wasn't expecting
something like this.

543
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,775
Only because you intentionally
weren't thinking about it

544
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:18,678
'cause you don't want to make
any tough decisions.

545
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:23,950
Are you completely sure
it's endocarditis?

546
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:28,321
That's not
a real question.

547
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:32,058
<i>Endocarditis fits</i>
<i>better than the alternatives.</i>

548
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:42,302
We're having a little trouble
hanging the right I.V.

549
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:45,104
The fastest way is
with you help.

550
00:25:57,384 --> 00:25:58,985
<i>Where'd Julia go?</i>

551
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:00,186
She's got a family.

552
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:02,188
I've got a family.

553
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:05,625
Three kids and a husband--
that's a family.

554
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:08,061
You were always tougher
on me than Julia.

555
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:10,363
Why is that?
I'm not.

556
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:13,833
I was thinking
about when you made me run

557
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:16,035
for yearbook editor--
I didn't want to.

558
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:18,004
I didn't have a social life
my whole senior year.

559
00:26:18,072 --> 00:26:19,706
<i>You let Julia do</i>
<i>whatever she wanted.</i>

560
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:22,375
We're debating
12th grade now?

561
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:24,344
Like anything's changed.
<i>What do you want, Lisa?</i>

562
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:27,413
Do you want to hear
I love you both the same?

563
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:29,582
Of course I do.

564
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:33,620
Okay.

565
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:36,489
But times like this,

566
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:39,659
when we argue,
it reminds me...

567
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:42,095
I have more in common
with her.

568
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:45,031
<i>She's nicer to me.</i>

569
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,100
<i>I love you both...</i>

570
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:52,005
But I like her
more than you.

571
00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:12,458
I called you three times.
My phone wasn't exactly on.

572
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:14,527
I figure I'll be getting
some angry calls

573
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:16,062
once radiology sends back
the angiogram.

574
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,998
They already did.

575
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:20,767
Here...

576
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:23,436
This is what you saw.

577
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,538
It's an anatomical variant
of the skull--

578
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:28,374
<i>the bone in proximity</i>
<i>to a blood vessel.</i>

579
00:27:28,442 --> 00:27:29,876
There was nothing wrong
with him.

580
00:27:32,146 --> 00:27:33,379
That was reason "g."

581
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:38,184
That's good news
for him.

582
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:47,360
Lungs clear?
Diffuse wheezing,

583
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:49,696
tightness, pruritis.

584
00:27:49,763 --> 00:27:51,631
It's an allergic reaction.

585
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:54,300
Looks like.
Doesn't make any sense.

586
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:55,835
<i>She's on prednisone.</i>

587
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:59,772
<i>How could she get</i>
<i>an allergic reaction?</i>

588
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:05,412
I switched out
the antibiotics,

589
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:07,014
put her back on prednisone--
her breathing's normal.

590
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:09,450
But the a-fib's back,
and her fever's up.

591
00:28:09,518 --> 00:28:11,085
Allergy's got to be due
to our antibiotics.

592
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:12,754
Does Kaufman
know what we did?

593
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,922
That's good.
No, that is terrible!

594
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,126
He doesn't know that
she got worse on antibiotics,

595
00:28:18,193 --> 00:28:19,660
so now he's thinking
endocarditis.

596
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:20,795
He'll put her back
on the antibiotics

597
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:21,796
that almost suffocated her.

598
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:22,930
What do we do?

599
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:27,168
We push through this.

600
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:30,304
It started in the heart.
Endocarditis still fits.

601
00:28:30,372 --> 00:28:31,773
<i>It's just got</i>
<i>to be fungal.</i>

602
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,807
We have to switch
Kaufman's antibiotics

603
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,308
for amphotericin "b."

604
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:36,377
I don't know if you're right.
I don't care.

605
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:37,678
<i>But we are gonna end up</i>
<i>killing this woman</i>

606
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:39,580
<i>if we keep confusing</i>
<i>her attending</i>

607
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:42,702
<i>with these secret meds.</i>
I don't care about confusing the attending!

608
00:28:42,802 --> 00:28:44,069
<i>I want this woman--</i>

609
00:28:44,137 --> 00:28:46,572
we're not talking about
simple antibiotics anymore.

610
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:48,107
Amphotericin "b"
is dangerous in itself.

611
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:50,202
<i>It's a poison.</i>
<i>That's why it kills fungi.</i>

612
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:53,283
It'll give her fever, chills--
which she already has,

613
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,493
which will help us
hide it.

614
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:56,028
I don't think I can take
a risk like that.

615
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:58,731
Well, then you shouldn't
have let her fire me!

616
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:06,538
Look, all you have to do
is switch the I.V.s again.

617
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:08,808
This has blown up on you
once already.

618
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:10,088
- He's right.
- Yep.

619
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:15,570
I'm so sorry
I got you guys into this.

620
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:16,784
<i>You should go.</i>

621
00:29:26,406 --> 00:29:28,041
I'm right.
<i>I know.</i>

622
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:31,058
And I'll do it, but--

623
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:48,309
I agree.
Fungal endocarditis fits.

624
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:52,813
But we still have
to tell your mother.

625
00:29:55,183 --> 00:29:58,118
<i>I don't want to tell her,</i>
<i>not at all.</i>

626
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:00,354
But the patient
is the highest priority.

627
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:05,134
I'm kicking you
out of your office.

628
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,256
Yes, you.

629
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,806
This is not her office yet.

630
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,762
If you tell anyone,

631
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,265
I will get you thrown
out of med school,

632
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,436
and I will destroy
your career.

633
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:45,510
I've thought about that.

634
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,680
Lying about me...

635
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,548
Won't work.

636
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,184
Everybody knows
your reputation.

637
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:55,019
True...

638
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,288
But I won't have to lie.

639
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:01,759
Buried in your coma patient's
big, big file

640
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:04,429
is a form
that doesn't allow treatment

641
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,532
without the expressed
consent of the relatives.

642
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,071
Wait...
You drew blood.

643
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,406
<i>And that's not just</i>
<i>a screwup.</i>

644
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,508
It's criminal assault.

645
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,514
But you told me--
<i>No. As you may recall...</i>

646
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,090
You set me up?

647
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,063
Why?

648
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,602
Because this patient
is the highest priority.

649
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,379
You made her think

650
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,415
I was hiding her son
being sick!

651
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:33,684
She scuttled the settlement.
She reported me to the bar.

652
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:36,354
I got to deal
with that crap now.

653
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:40,591
I will sue you for slander,
for tortious interference,

654
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:44,829
and anything else
I can use to destroy you.

655
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:48,533
Oh, and my sister says
stay out of her life...

656
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,469
<i>You failure.</i>

657
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:55,006
Five years of therapy.

658
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,480
<i>Dr. Kaufman?</i>

659
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:06,984
I need to speak with you
and the patient alone.

660
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,390
I'm skipping
the credentials committee.

661
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,425
I'm going straight
to the state board

662
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,094
and reporting you for--

663
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,964
<i>what you've done is</i>
<i>so off the spectrum,</i>

664
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,699
I don't know there's
a specific name for it.

665
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,601
I think he's talking
to you.

666
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,103
<i>Marty, calm down.</i>

667
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,337
<i>And you--what you did</i>
<i>is worse.</i>

668
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,438
<i>He's an insane lunatic.</i>

669
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,906
You're the Dean
of Medicine!

670
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,708
I want you off my case.

671
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:31,809
That's exactly right.

672
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:33,644
Don't get excited.
You're fired too.

673
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,380
What? I'll never get away
from House or my daughter

674
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,015
<i>if I stay here.</i>

675
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,917
<i>Transfer me</i>
<i>to Princeton General.</i>

676
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,086
Mom...

677
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:45,022
You're very ill,
and you're very angry.

678
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,724
You really think now

679
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,426
<i>is the right time</i>
<i>to make a decision like this?</i>

680
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:51,295
You lied to me
and betrayed me.

681
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,231
Do you think
I really care

682
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,500
what you consider
a good idea anymore?

683
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:13,151
I'll get the ambulance.

684
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,157
Happy?

685
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:30,456
I can't believe it.

686
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:36,028
What just happened?

687
00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:39,482
You just killed her.

688
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,622
Are you blaming me?

689
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:47,877
This is all because
you're so arrogant,

690
00:34:47,945 --> 00:34:50,447
you goaded her
into firing you!

691
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:52,449
Actually, my mistakes started
a little after that,

692
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:54,651
when I agreed
to your brilliant scheme

693
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,353
to keep me on the case
after she'd fired me off it.

694
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,854
She would have left
the hospital.

695
00:34:57,922 --> 00:35:00,223
Only 'cause you would have
let her, like you did just now.

696
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:01,524
You think
I can control her?

697
00:35:01,592 --> 00:35:03,293
I don't know.
I've never seen you try.

698
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:04,861
I have been rebelling
against this woman

699
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:06,129
my entire life.

700
00:35:06,197 --> 00:35:08,298
Here's what I've seen.

701
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:11,001
She insults you,
you complain to me.

702
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,203
I drug her at dinner,
you never let her know.

703
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,138
We slip her medicine,
happens behind her back.

704
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:18,041
You never confront her...

705
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:20,343
And it pisses me off.

706
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,548
Are you taking this
personally?

707
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:28,351
She leaves, she dies.

708
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,587
One day...

709
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:33,923
Maybe a week from now,
maybe a year from now,

710
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:36,026
you're gonna decide that
the man sleeping next to you

711
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,462
killed your mother.

712
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:46,770
Get me my patient back.

713
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:50,940
This is really bad, Lise.

714
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:53,410
I swear to God, Jules,
I will call security!

715
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,658
I asked you before
why you were tough on me.

716
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:10,226
I wasn't.
You were.

717
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,262
And I know why.

718
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:16,332
You see something in me
that you didn't see in Julia

719
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,767
and you didn't see in you--

720
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:20,370
a type of ambition,
a type of brains.

721
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:22,439
That's why you rode me.

722
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:25,775
You made me yearbook editor,
summa undergrad,

723
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:28,478
A.O.A. in med school.

724
00:36:28,546 --> 00:36:31,081
The only time I ever see light
in your eyes

725
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,750
is when you hear me talking
about my job.

726
00:36:37,354 --> 00:36:40,724
The reason you keep coming
to see me in the clinic

727
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:42,892
is because you trust me.

728
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,396
<i>You trust</i>
<i>my medical judgment.</i>

729
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,998
So here it is.

730
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:51,935
If you transfer
to Princeton General,

731
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,571
you'll be treated well,
and you'll die.

732
00:36:54,638 --> 00:36:57,173
If you stay here
with House,

733
00:36:57,241 --> 00:37:00,877
you'll be treated badly,
but you'll live.

734
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,615
I don't care if I have
to slash the tires

735
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:09,152
of every ambulance
in this bay, mom.

736
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,989
I am not letting you
leave my hospital.

737
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,528
One, two, three.

738
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:21,064
I got it.
How you feeling, mom?

739
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:22,665
I feel a little dizzy.

740
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:24,667
Your heart's still weak
from the infection.

741
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:26,302
We'll hang
an antifungal I.V.

742
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,605
If you're so great,
how come you're not running

743
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:30,206
your department anymore?

744
00:37:30,274 --> 00:37:31,975
What are you talking
about, mom?

745
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,377
That's what he told me.
<i>Two days ago,</i>

746
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:36,112
I said that I didn't have
a department to run.

747
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,981
I was being sarcastic.
No, you weren't.

748
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,083
Right, because people
who are talking

749
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:41,518
can't tell if they're
being sarcastic.

750
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:44,754
That doesn't make any sense.
Of course they can.

751
00:37:44,822 --> 00:37:46,289
But you weren't.

752
00:37:52,263 --> 00:37:54,564
I love A-Rod.

753
00:37:54,632 --> 00:37:57,066
He's so modest.

754
00:37:57,134 --> 00:37:58,468
<i>And I highly respect</i>

755
00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:00,603
the paintings he has
of himself as a centaur.

756
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:01,838
Question--

757
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:04,607
do I like A-Rod?

758
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:08,011
Yes...
Whoever he is.

759
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,880
She can't recognize
sarcasm?

760
00:38:10,948 --> 00:38:12,916
Deficit in the right
parahippocampal gyrus,

761
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:15,852
which means CNS involvement
before the fever.

762
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,189
I was wrong
about the endocarditis.

763
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:22,959
I-I don't--
I don't feel--

764
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:24,227
Mom? Mom!

765
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:27,430
Heart rate 170.
Nurse!

766
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:32,068
Do something.
I am.

767
00:38:32,136 --> 00:38:34,137
House!
The fever was hypothalamic.

768
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:37,307
That means brain, heart,
anemia, allergy.

769
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:38,641
<i>You hear that, what do you think?</i>
I don't know.

770
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:40,710
You think heavy-metal toxicity.
It can't be.

771
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,779
You treated with chelation for lead.
She got better, then she got worse.

772
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:44,314
She never stopped
being poisoned.

773
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,651
What are you doing?
You really want me to stop and explain?

774
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:03,299
There it is.
Look at that.

775
00:39:05,436 --> 00:39:07,704
<i>The muscle's black.</i>

776
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:10,540
Necrosis?
Metallosis.

777
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:12,275
Her artificial hip

778
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:14,611
"weared and teared"
way too much.

779
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:17,313
It's cobalt poisoning.

780
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:18,615
We need Chase
to get an O.R.

781
00:39:18,682 --> 00:39:21,117
I'm gonna start
chelation again.

782
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:54,384
I thought you didn't want
to see me.

783
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:57,153
I didn't.
Foreman called me.

784
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,460
I didn't know
that you thought

785
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:07,330
that little boy had
a bleed in his head.

786
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:12,902
I will kill my brother

787
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,606
if he messes
with you anymore.

788
00:40:16,674 --> 00:40:20,343
What do you care?

789
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:23,079
Chris...

790
00:40:23,147 --> 00:40:26,983
You were
a crappy husband...

791
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:30,119
But you are
a good person.

792
00:40:57,614 --> 00:41:01,217
Once again,
you are unfired.

793
00:41:01,285 --> 00:41:02,652
Why?

794
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:07,423
You sold me out
even though you knew

795
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:11,427
that you were gonna get thrown
out of med school.

796
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:13,029
That's just...

797
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:15,832
Kind of impressive.

798
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:20,003
I keep my job
if I stand up to you.

799
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,005
I keep it if I don't.

800
00:41:22,072 --> 00:41:23,506
I...

801
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:25,108
Don't buy it.

802
00:41:28,012 --> 00:41:29,479
When Cuddy
was protecting me before,

803
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:31,014
she was protecting
a doctor.

804
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:34,050
She's now protecting
a boyfriend.

805
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:36,652
The hospital's not gonna
put up with that for long.

806
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,689
So I need you
to protect me

807
00:41:39,757 --> 00:41:42,258
from doing something
Cuddy will regret.

808
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,832
See you bright
and late tomorrow.
