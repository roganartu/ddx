00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,456
So I'd hurry up.

179
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:27,891
So hurry up.

180
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,759
This man's abdomen
is wide open.

181
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:32,228
His core temp
is down to 95.

182
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:33,630
Fine.
I will deal with it.

183
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:36,733
You better or
I'm gonna file--

184
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:41,371
I don't care what he told you.
Turn it back up now.

185
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,006
Thought you had
an important meeting.

186
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:44,507
You're an idiot.

187
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:45,775
What are you gonna do
the next time

188
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:47,544
One of your patients
needs a liver transplant?

189
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:49,612
Go talk to wilson about
something completely unrelated

190
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,581
And see what happens.

191
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,284
Mystery infection guy
is now covered in boils

192
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:56,686
And has an abscess big enough
to put your fist in.

193
00:07:56,754 --> 00:07:59,656
He needs to get into
an o.R. Tout suite.

194
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:01,090
Hourani will
be done soon.

195
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:02,659
Good.

196
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,427
I'll have some
hot chocolate waiting.

197
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:06,162
[elevator bell dings
and cell phone rings]

198
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,697
Marina, hey.

199
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:09,699
How's she doing?

200
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,435
She vomited?

201
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:15,505
Give her some more ibuprofen and
put her in the bath for a bit.

202
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:17,474
And call me in a half an hour
if it doesn't go down.

203
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,408
[cell phone rings]
sorry, marina.

204
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:19,709
I have another call.

205
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:22,378
Just call me
in a half an hour either way.

206
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:24,347
Hey.
What's up?

207
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:27,116
Tell him I'm halfway there.

208
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:30,253
He's the one who insisted
on the early meeting.

209
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:33,089
I--
all right, I'm coming.

210
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:42,765
Morning, eli.

211
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,101
Sorry about the wait.
Oh, it's all right.

212
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,570
I hear you got a sick kid.

213
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:49,072
Yeah, I know what that's like.

214
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:51,174
Or I should say my wife does.

215
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:53,943
So you guys ready
to give some ground

216
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,311
So we can make this deal?

217
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,813
Why would we do that?

218
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,481
We've been going at this
for eight months.

219
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:00,917
Soon as you decide
to get reasonable.

220
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,919
I'm the one
that's unreasonable?

221
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:06,256
You've taken weeks to respond to
every proposal I've presented.

222
00:09:06,323 --> 00:09:08,091
Atlanticnet insurance
is the largest healthcare

223
00:09:08,158 --> 00:09:09,993
Provider in new jersey, and
you're not the only hospital

224
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,261
Whose contracts are up.

225
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:13,263
So is your team ready
to come back to the table?

226
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,266
Yeah.
We're not going to.

227
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,967
This is our final offer.

228
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:20,670
<i>We're willing to go</i>
<i>with a capitated structure,</i>

229
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:22,071
But we need at least
12% increase

230
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:23,840
In reimbursements
across the board.

231
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:27,744
Well, the good news is I can
give you a quick response.

232
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:29,512
Not a chance.

233
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,082
But as always,
nice talking to you.

234
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,151
Say hi to your sister
for me.

235
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:39,756
If you don't
accept the offer,

236
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:43,226
We're gonna terminate
the contract.

237
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:46,296
Gonna be hard
to keep this place open

238
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:49,299
If all your patients
have to pay cash.

239
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,234
Princeton plainsboro
is the smallest hospital

240
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:52,802
In our entire network.

241
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,238
We're also the best.
Doesn't matter.

242
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:57,040
We are responsible
for covering 13 million people.

243
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:58,374
We don't have enough cash

244
00:09:58,442 --> 00:09:59,475
To buy them
all maseratis.

245
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:01,077
I know what you paid bergen,

246
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:02,645
<i>Newark beth israel,</i>
<i>robert wood johnson--</i>

247
00:10:02,713 --> 00:10:04,247
'cause they have leverage.

248
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,316
You can be expensive
or small,

249
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:07,717
But you can't be both.

250
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:09,752
I've engaged jones/curtin
to handle the p.R.,

251
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,054
And I'm prepared to make
the announcement

252
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:12,155
At 3:00 p.M. Today.

253
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,192
First lesson every good
poker player learns

254
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,027
Is don't get emotional.

255
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,829
You don't have the cards.

256
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:21,497
And the sooner
you realize that,

257
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:24,434
The sooner a reasonable
contract will get signed.

258
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,571
You have until 3:00 p.M.
To change your mind.

259
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,875
I always did
like your style.

260
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:36,546
Gonna be sad
to see you go.

261
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:55,275
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

262
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:57,210
Thanks.

263
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:01,716
Uh, take this up
to the call center

264
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:04,151
And tell claudia to give one
to each c.S. Rep

265
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,087
And to start going over
the answers to each question.

266
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:07,621
Okay.

267
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,223
And under no circumstances
is any of this info

268
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,591
To go outside that room.

269
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,393
The scripts are numbered
and I want a list

270
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:13,694
Of every person
she gives one to.

271
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:15,096
Got it.
Anything else?

272
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:17,832
No.

273
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:22,169
If you really wanted
to make a deal,

274
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:23,170
You should have ditched
the push-up

275
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,705
And gone with a demi.

276
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:27,041
Nothing makes a guy wanna
close like high beams.

277
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:28,476
What have you heard?

278
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:30,945
Your meeting with the weasel
lasted less than five minutes,

279
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:33,414
Which means you either agreed
to a completely sensible

280
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:36,417
30-day extension
or one of you

281
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:39,353
Issued a completely
ridiculous ultimatum.

282
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:44,125
Oh, goody.
You or him?

283
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:46,027
Me.
Way to go, boss.

284
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:47,928
You just said
it was ridiculous.

285
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:49,764
Ridiculous to make.
Fun to watch.

286
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:51,665
As long as it's not
just a bluff.

287
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,200
Please tell me
it's not a bluff.

288
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:55,936
It is not a bluff,
and it is not ridiculous.

289
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:58,472
Just because we're
not some huge--

290
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,142
Mr. Pluta started
hallucinating

291
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,109
Before we could
put him under.

292
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:03,277
His b.P. Is plummeting.

293
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:04,478
He has an elevated
heart rate.

294
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:05,346
Looks like congestive
heart failure.

295
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:07,114
Interesting.

296
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:08,682
I don't care how
interesting it is.

297
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,252
You are not infecting him
with malaria.

298
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:13,554
Since when is malaria
a cure for heart failure?

299
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:14,755
It's not.

300
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,123
It's not congestive
heart failure.

301
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:19,060
It's gotta be...

302
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,499
Just got off the phone
with hourani.

303
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:28,402
I'm sorry, dave. I don't
really have time right now--

304
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,204
Think I had time to listen
to him go for 20 minutes

305
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:31,872
About the damn temperature
in the o.R.?

306
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,907
I took care of it.

307
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:34,642
It's not an "it."

308
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:35,876
It's a "him" you need
to take care of.

309
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:37,211
You got the entire staff
catering

310
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,180
To house's every whim,
and I can't get approval

311
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:41,515
To hire a replacement
for the surgeon

312
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,883
He stole from
my department?

313
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:44,452
A doctor I only took on
in the first place

314
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,953
Because of pressure
from you.

315
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:47,321
So you didn't want chase,

316
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:49,056
But now you're pissed
you can't have him?

317
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:50,991
You want to convene
a search committee

318
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,660
And start looking
for a new chief of surgery?

319
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:53,928
No, dave.

320
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:55,262
Then you better stop
spending all your time

321
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,866
Putting out his fires
and start doing your damn job.

322
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:02,803
Ahem.

323
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:08,776
There a problem
with dr. Thomas?

324
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:12,213
No, just refereeing
a dispute about the o.R.

325
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,185
So we don't yet have
a contract with atlanticnet.

326
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:20,488
We gave you an extra week

327
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:22,957
And you assured us
you'd have a deal by today.

328
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,693
We could have a deal,
just not the deal we deserve.

329
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,862
So what do you want,
approval for an extension?

330
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:29,063
<i>We've been at this</i>
<i>for eight months.</i>

331
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:31,665
An extension isn't
gonna change anything.

332
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,634
So what's your plan?

333
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:35,102
I presented a final offer.

334
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,404
I told them that we would agree
to a capitated structure

335
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:40,808
If they increase
reimbursements by 12%.

336
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,110
A final offer?
What does that mean?

337
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:45,179
If they don't accept
it by 3:00,

338
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:47,681
We're gonna terminate.

339
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:49,483
Are you out of your mind?

340
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:51,785
If we don't accept
atlanticnet insurance,

341
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,754
We'll lose 80%
of our patients.

342
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:56,390
We'd be lucky
to last three months.

343
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,626
We're not asking for anything
they can't afford.

344
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:00,327
<i>Their last offer</i>
<i>was a 4% increase</i>

345
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:03,531
And you're demanding 12.

346
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:05,232
They're paying even more
at some places.

347
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,034
Units that have lower ratings
than ours.

348
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:09,336
In a perfect world,
that would definitely matter.

349
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:10,938
Sanford, they're all
about growth.

350
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:12,606
And they know they
don't get new customers

351
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:14,575
By marketing themselves
as the biggest.

352
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:16,844
They do it by claiming
they're the best,

353
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:18,512
And they can't do that
if their patients

354
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,615
Can't come to us.

355
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:24,785
What was morgan's reaction
when you told him?

356
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:28,255
He didn't give in,
but he will.

357
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:30,824
I told him I'd make
the announcement at 3:00.

358
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,793
He'll call back
before then.

359
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,398
They need us.

360
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:38,532
No, we need them.

361
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,867
We need each other.

362
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,372
The negotiation
is your responsibility,

363
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,841
So we can't stop you
if this is what you want to do.

364
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:50,311
But just so we're clear,

365
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,646
If we don't have a contract
with atlanticnet,

366
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:55,983
You're not gonna have
a contract with us.

367
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:37,324
Guess who didn't show up
for clinic duty?

368
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:39,260
<i>Oh, don't tell me.</i>

369
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:41,729
The guy with all the boils
needs a liver transplant.

370
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,197
No, his doctor needs a nap.

371
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:44,465
You want me to try
to find him?

372
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:45,799
You really need him?
I need someone.

373
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:48,202
[sighs]

374
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,837
I have cancer.

375
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:51,672
Why do you think
you have cancer?

376
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,107
I don't think I have cancer.

377
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:55,209
I know I have cancer.

378
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:57,911
I had surgery to remove
a malignant polyp

379
00:15:57,979 --> 00:15:59,747
In my colon
six months ago,

380
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:01,815
And now it's spread
to my liver and lymph nodes.

381
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,418
So you're under the care
of an oncologist?

382
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:06,553
Yeah, but he won't give me
the prescription I need.

383
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:08,222
Do you need more painkillers?

384
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,157
No.
I need breast milk.

385
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:14,795
Human breast milk?
Yes.

386
00:16:14,863 --> 00:16:17,464
It has cancer-fighting
qualities.

387
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:18,799
Well, in newborns,
it's been shown

388
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:20,501
To reduce future risk.

389
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:22,303
No, in adults
with cancer too.

390
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,837
I've read studies.

391
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,472
Hmm.

392
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,375
Look...

393
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,644
I even know a place
where I can buy it.

394
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,279
I just need a prescription
so I can

395
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:35,015
Get reimbursed
by my insurance company.

396
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,252
They said they'd reimburse
the cost of breast milk

397
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,853
As a cancer treatment?

398
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,255
They reimburse prescriptions,

399
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:42,790
So if you write me
a prescription,

400
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:44,258
Then they have no choice
but to pay.

401
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:46,794
Well, actually,
they have a choice.

402
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:50,097
What are you, some type of shill
for the insurance company?

403
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:51,498
No.

404
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:53,067
Look, I've been paying
premiums for 30 years,

405
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:54,601
And I've never been sick
a day in my life

406
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:55,736
Till this happened.

407
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:58,405
Now I can't work.

408
00:16:58,473 --> 00:17:00,641
I got no money.

409
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,409
And you want to help them
screw me over?

410
00:17:02,477 --> 00:17:03,911
I'm not screwing you over.
Well, then give me the script.

411
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:05,112
It won't help you.

412
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,613
Will it hurt me?
No, but--

413
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:09,650
Okay, so it won't harm me
and it won't harm you,

414
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:10,684
But it's this
insurance company--

415
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:12,319
This is not about insurance.

416
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:13,954
Then give me
the damn script.

417
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:23,130
I'm sick.

418
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:25,032
I need help.

419
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,336
<i>I need something.</i>

420
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:30,904
I'm sorry.

421
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:37,811
Bitch.

422
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:46,086
[sighs]

423
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:48,021
Anyone call?

424
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:49,189
Yeah.

425
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:50,891
The e.R.

426
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,459
They said the vascular
who's on call

427
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:53,627
Doesn't have privileges.

428
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,229
Then why is he on call?

429
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:57,664
Dowd's at a conference
and got him to fill in.

430
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:59,333
Be nice if he got somebody
who can actually work here.

431
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:00,534
Call ereshefsky.

432
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:03,404
Ereshefsky?
She's not gonna do it.

433
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:06,373
She owes me a favor.
She's still not gonna do it.

434
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:08,475
All right.

435
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:10,277
Oh, and there's a guy
in your office.

436
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:12,479
I think he's a lawyer.
Why is he in my office?

437
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:13,881
Said he didn't want to sit
around a bunch of sick people.

438
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:14,782
I tried to stop him.

439
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,388
Hi.

440
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,724
I'm dr. Lisa cuddy.
Ronald westbrook.

441
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,826
I appreciate your taking
the time to meet with me.

442
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:27,795
Hard to avoid since
you're already in my office.

443
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:29,029
Sorry about that,
I just got over

444
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:30,764
A wicked cold
that didn't want to--

445
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:32,466
How can I help you?

446
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:34,034
I represent martin acevedo.

447
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:36,136
He's filed a suit
against pph

448
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:38,138
And dr. Robert chase
for performing surgery

449
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:40,240
Without consent.

450
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:41,875
Yes, I saw that.

451
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:43,143
I also saw
the consent forms.

452
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:44,411
They were all signed.

453
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,079
Yes, but my client
was assured

454
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:48,415
That the procedure would just
be a few minor sutures.

455
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:49,950
Wait.

456
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:51,385
Your client accidentally
cut his thumb off

457
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:52,386
With a table saw,
right?

458
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:54,455
Yes.
And dr. Chase reattached it?

459
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:55,789
Yes.

460
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:58,392
You're saying he didn't
want it reattached?

461
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,729
No, he most certainly
did not.

462
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:05,199
His insurance only covered 60%
of inpatient expenses,

463
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:07,267
So he would only agree
to the cheapest option.

464
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,269
So what did you tell him?

465
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:11,305
I said I'd sew up the skin
over the exposed bone.

466
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,307
Then I put him under,
got his thumb

467
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:15,642
From the paramedics,
and reattached it.

468
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,611
What's he gonna do?

469
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,846
Tell the judge
that I harmed him

470
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:21,014
By reattaching
a vital digit?

471
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:22,282
Both he and the
insurance company are suing

472
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,484
To get out of paying
the bill.

473
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:26,453
It's over $80,000.

474
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:27,721
It was his thumb.

475
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,089
I couldn't just let him
toss it in the trash

476
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:30,524
To save a few bucks.

477
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:33,327
[sighs]

478
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:36,897
The pharm tech
who called in sick is here.

479
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:39,433
She's waiting
in your office.

480
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:43,203
He barely even looks
at me anymore.

481
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,272
We haven't had sex
in months.

482
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,642
You don't need pills
to lose weight.

483
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,379
There are healthier ways,
legal ways.

484
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,414
You don't understand
how hard it is.

485
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:57,518
Ever since our second child,
no matter what I do.

486
00:19:57,585 --> 00:19:59,586
I just wanted to lose
ten more pounds

487
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:02,155
And then I was gonna stop.

488
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:04,658
I'm sorry.

489
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:06,860
Forging pharmaceutical orders,
stealing--

490
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,896
Don't fire me, dr. Cuddy.

491
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:11,565
Please.
I'm begging you.

492
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:13,967
If sam finds out,
he'll divorce me for sure,

493
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:15,469
And my kids--

494
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:18,438
I will never do it again,
I swear.

495
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,440
Just give me
a second chance.

496
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:26,246
I won't report the theft
to the dea...

497
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:27,881
But I have to fire you.

498
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:33,320
[sobbing]

499
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:36,790
Just take a few minutes
to compose yourself,

500
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:40,360
Then go down to hr and they'll
give you your last check.

501
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:43,430
I've been a perfect employee
for seven years.

502
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:46,533
I know, but this
is too big.

503
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:47,668
I'm sorry.

504
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:06,253
[sighs]

505
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,432
How's it going?

506
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:14,101
Got three hours to save this
place from bankruptcy,

507
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:16,170
I just fired one
of my best employees,

508
00:21:16,238 --> 00:21:17,972
And the woman taking care
of my sick child

509
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,373
Isn't returning my calls.

510
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:20,975
Rachel's gonna be fine,

511
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:22,776
I'm sure whoever he or she
is deserved it,

512
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:24,778
And we're not going bankrupt.

513
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:26,680
Are we?
Don't worry.

514
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:28,949
The board will fire me before
they allow that to happen.

515
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:31,552
They'd never fire you.

516
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,420
I just told
atlanticnet insurance

517
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:36,357
I'd terminate unless
they gave us a 12% bump.

518
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:38,659
They might fire you.

519
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:40,828
Marina,
hey, it's me.

520
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:42,129
I haven't heard back
from you.

521
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:43,330
Can you call me
as soon as you can?

522
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:45,199
Thank you.

523
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,034
You try lucas?

524
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:48,736
<i>He's either sleeping</i>
<i>or avoiding me.</i>

525
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:50,537
You in a fight?

526
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,072
Not yet,
but we're gonna be.

527
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:03,350
What do you think
I should do about atlanticnet?

528
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:05,019
You're asking a guy
who paid

529
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:06,787
Full sticker price
for his last car.

530
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:09,690
You ask house?

531
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:12,593
He's a master manipulator
who always gets what he wants.

532
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:14,995
This situation is
out of control enough already.

533
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:16,997
House is the last person
I want to get involved.

534
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:28,108
Get out of my chair.

535
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:29,543
And the answer is no.

536
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:31,011
You ever noticed how
many porn sites

537
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,514
Have "mom"
in the domain name?

538
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:36,750
Hot moms, hungry moms,
mature moms.

539
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:38,519
That ought to make you
feel pretty good.

540
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,191
What do you want?

541
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,994
Looks like boils,
altered mental status,

542
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:49,897
And heart failure was called
by renal cell carcinoma.

543
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:52,032
I need your signature to start
treating it with malaria.

544
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,067
<i>Don't worry.</i>

545
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:54,601
I'm giving him chemo too.

546
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:56,003
What is your sudden
obsession with malaria?

547
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:58,672
Just trying to play my part
cutting costs.

548
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,741
Malaria is the simplest,
cheapest method

549
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:01,742
Of delivering hypothermia.

550
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,876
Right.

551
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:04,912
The only money you care about--

552
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:06,380
You bet someone
you could use malaria

553
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:07,948
As a diagnostic tool?

554
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:10,451
That doesn't sound like me.

555
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:12,052
Forget it.

556
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,887
Okay, let me see
if I've got this straight.

557
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:17,624
A bet that puts one patient
at minor risk is juvenile?

558
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:18,859
And irresponsible
and dangerous.

559
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:21,228
But going all-in
against atlanticnet--

560
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:23,163
Is not a bet.

561
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:26,200
That is a carefully considered
negotiating position.

562
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:30,104
I'm gonna put this
in your inbox.

563
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:31,805
I just hope
it doesn't get lost

564
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:34,808
Underneath all the other stuff
you're carefully considering.

565
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:42,950
Can you take a look
at these per diem schedules?

566
00:23:43,017 --> 00:23:44,218
Let me know
if you see any conflicts.

567
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:45,486
Got it.

568
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:47,788
Oh, and ereshefsky
actually did come in.

569
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:50,124
You catch her leaving a sponge
in a guy or something?

570
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:51,825
Wasn't a medical mistake.
What was it?

571
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:53,093
Can't tell you now.
She came in.

572
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:54,395
Hey, dan!

573
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:57,164
Have you audited
the ephedrine orders yet?

574
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:58,832
Why?
You told me she confessed.

575
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,100
Stan.
All right, yeah.

576
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:03,003
I'll take care of it.
Today.

577
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:04,538
You know he's cussing you out
in there now.

578
00:24:04,606 --> 00:24:05,773
I don't care
as long as he does it.

579
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,875
What a bitch.
What are you doing here?

580
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:09,643
Sounded like you were going
to be too busy for lunch,

581
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:11,879
So my specialty,
spinach lasagna.

582
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:13,380
Sure you didn't come looking
for more people

583
00:24:13,448 --> 00:24:14,882
You could brag
about our sex life to?

584
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:16,984
Okay.
Sorry.

585
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:18,185
From now on,
I got nothing but bad things

586
00:24:18,253 --> 00:24:20,254
To say about our sex life.

587
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:22,389
Or nothing to say.

588
00:24:22,457 --> 00:24:23,891
And what's going on
with marina?

589
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,993
She hasn't called me back.
She was gonna call.

590
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,328
I told her I'd let you know
everything was okay.

591
00:24:28,396 --> 00:24:30,063
So her fever broke?

592
00:24:30,131 --> 00:24:32,199
What exactly does that mean,
"when a fever breaks"?

593
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:33,500
Lucas, I'm very busy.

594
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:34,802
Does she have a fever
or not?

595
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,470
That was gonna
be your lunch?

596
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:38,305
And you didn't have
breakfast either.

597
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:41,108
No, she doesn't
have a fever,

598
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:43,677
And the rash was just, like,
a little diaper rash.

599
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:44,812
What rash?
She has a rash?

600
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:47,080
Little one.

601
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:49,082
Lisa, don't worry.
I'm telling you.

602
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:54,221
[cell phone rings]

603
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:55,556
Oh, god.

604
00:24:55,623 --> 00:24:57,424
I must have grabbed marina's
cell by mistake.

605
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,098
And I turned the ringer off
on the home phone

606
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,667
So I could sleep.

607
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:08,469
What are you doing to me?

608
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:09,803
I take it
your deal's not done.

609
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:12,039
Not yet.

610
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:13,440
How about I take
a quick look

611
00:25:13,508 --> 00:25:15,242
Into the guy who's in charge
of the negotiations?

612
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,510
Or better yet,
the ceo.

613
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:19,246
If I get some dirt,
you can use it as leverage.

614
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:23,917
There's no time.

615
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:26,587
How do you even
find these guys?

616
00:25:26,654 --> 00:25:30,858
Thanks.

617
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:32,693
You should have seen
the guy's face.

618
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,294
I thought he was gonna have
a damn coronary

619
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:35,629
Right there in the tee box.

620
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:36,864
Excuse me.

621
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:38,265
You're keith tannenbaum,

622
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,200
Ceo of atlanticnet insurance,
right?

623
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:43,136
That's me.
How can I help you?

624
00:25:43,204 --> 00:25:44,238
Well, actually,
I think we can help each other.

625
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:45,939
I am dr. Lisa cuddy,

626
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:48,075
Dean of medicine
at princeton plainsboro.

627
00:25:48,142 --> 00:25:50,511
Oh, yeah.
Well, how are you?

628
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:52,012
Well, I'm a little unhappy.

629
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,046
You're aware
that our contract

630
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:54,982
With your company
is up this week?

631
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:56,250
Yes, and we have
a negotiating team

632
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:57,718
That's working
all that out.

633
00:25:57,785 --> 00:25:58,919
Princeton plainsboro
has the highest-rated e.R.

634
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:01,455
In the state,
the most advanced icu,

635
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:04,825
And the most innovative
diagnostic medicine department

636
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:06,026
In the entire country.

637
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:07,361
Good to know.

638
00:26:07,428 --> 00:26:08,896
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to--

639
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:10,364
While atlanticnet insurance
has a marketing budget

640
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:12,733
That's more
than our pediatric icus

641
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,334
And transplant units
combined.

642
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:16,703
Your pga sponsorship could pay
for our walk-in clinic,

643
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:18,205
And the money you
spend to fuel

644
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:20,374
Your two private jets could fund
our air ambulance service

645
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:21,975
For the next three years.

646
00:26:22,043 --> 00:26:23,410
Your point being?

647
00:26:23,478 --> 00:26:25,345
Your growth may be good
for your bottom line,

648
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,214
But ours allows us
to save lives.

649
00:26:27,282 --> 00:26:30,584
And I would rather not
have to announce to the press

650
00:26:30,652 --> 00:26:32,352
How selective
your company appears to be

651
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,122
When it comes
to cutting costs.

652
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:37,758
[scoffs]

653
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:40,661
Well, morgan was right.

654
00:26:40,728 --> 00:26:42,162
You are one tough gal.

655
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:47,801
You can portray me
as a rich bastard

656
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:49,736
In the press all you want,

657
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:51,705
Just as long
as I stay rich.

658
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:04,943
Stan is looking for you.
I'm busy.

659
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:06,878
He said it's urgent.

660
00:27:10,784 --> 00:27:12,384
I don't understand
how it's even possible.

661
00:27:12,452 --> 00:27:13,886
I've checked it twice.

662
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:16,021
How much?
Ten cases.

663
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:17,623
Ten cases?

664
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:19,725
Going back three years.

665
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:21,193
What the hell have
you been doing, stan?

666
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:22,895
You're supposed
to be managing this place.

667
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:24,830
All the paperwork I signed
was correct.

668
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:26,899
She must have altered
the orders afterwards.

669
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:29,602
Didn't you ever cross-check
it with the bills that came in?

670
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:31,403
I delegated it.

671
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:33,973
To whom?

672
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,207
To gail.

673
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:36,909
Look, she seemed perfectly
trustworthy.

674
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:38,210
How was I supposed to know?

675
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:40,012
By doing your job.
I'm sorry.

676
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,380
Have you notified the dea?

677
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:43,048
The dea?
Jeez, stan.

678
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:44,316
Hello!

679
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:45,751
You don't steal $50,000
worth of pills

680
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:47,052
Because you want
to lose weight.

681
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,654
She's supplying
a meth lab.

682
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:49,955
Just get her back
in here.

683
00:27:50,023 --> 00:27:51,323
All right.

684
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:53,225
Now.

685
00:27:57,998 --> 00:28:00,165
Oh, you ever want a job,
trust me.

686
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,134
He'll double whatever
you're making here.

687
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:04,503
Take it he liked
my proposal.

688
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:07,106
Enough to tell me to get
my ass back over here today.

689
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:09,008
Here.

690
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:10,676
He's willing to go to 8%.

691
00:28:10,744 --> 00:28:12,044
Eight?

692
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:13,746
We were at four.

693
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:15,881
Your board's gonna think
you walk on water.

694
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:18,317
I want 12.

695
00:28:20,954 --> 00:28:22,821
You're not gonna get 12.

696
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:24,590
There's just no way.

697
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:27,259
8% barely covers
our cost inflation.

698
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:28,527
But capitated structure
should allow you

699
00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:30,029
To hold down inflation.

700
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:31,163
And shifts all your risk
onto us,

701
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:32,665
Which is why
we deserve 12.

702
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:34,133
Lisa, come on.

703
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,368
The guy who mows my lawn makes
more than my kid's teacher.

704
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:38,504
Hell, the two guys
whose lunch you interrupted

705
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:40,773
Could get fired, and their
severance would be more

706
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,841
Than most of their employees
make in a lifetime.

707
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:46,045
It doesn't have anything
to do with what you deserve.

708
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:48,781
This is it.

709
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:54,119
Take it or leave it.

710
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:03,662
[sighs]

711
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:24,350
What are you doing?
Hey.

712
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:26,185
Know any good
transplant surgeons?

713
00:29:26,252 --> 00:29:28,954
Turns out his kidneys aren't
the only thing failing.

714
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:30,456
And I know what
you're thinking.

715
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:32,925
But malaria wouldn't destroy
his liver that fast,

716
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:34,993
Especially since
we never infected him.

717
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:36,829
I thought you said--

718
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,030
Apparently foreman
now thinks that he has

719
00:29:38,098 --> 00:29:39,431
The authority
to overrule my orders

720
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:41,500
Just because the fda
wouldn't approve.

721
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:43,235
Don't worry.
I'll deal with him.

722
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:45,204
If you could just
talk to hourani--

723
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:49,975
What would you do?

724
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:52,978
If you paged me
during sex?

725
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:55,914
About the contract
with atlanticnet.

726
00:29:55,982 --> 00:30:00,319
I got them to come up to 8%,
but we should get at least 12.

727
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:02,321
It's all numbers.

728
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:04,957
Do the math
and nothing else.

729
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:06,725
It's not about my pride.

730
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:08,227
It's about the principle.

731
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:09,928
They're trying to screw us
over because we're small.

732
00:30:09,996 --> 00:30:11,730
That's what they're
supposed to do.

733
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:13,899
They should be pressuring other
hospitals to be more like us,

734
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:15,734
Not trying to make us
more like them.

735
00:30:15,802 --> 00:30:17,836
It's stupid.

736
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:19,538
Putting your job on the line
in an effort

737
00:30:19,606 --> 00:30:22,775
To stamp out stupidity isn't?

738
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:24,977
You would.

739
00:30:25,044 --> 00:30:26,779
Probably.

740
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:28,714
But then I also wanted
to try to cure cancer

741
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:31,650
By infecting a guy with malaria
to win a $50 bet.

742
00:30:31,718 --> 00:30:35,087
You really want to be
like me?

743
00:30:59,312 --> 00:31:02,815
As you know,
for the past eight months,

744
00:31:02,882 --> 00:31:04,450
We've been trying
to renegotiate our contract

745
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:05,918
With atlanticnet insurance.

746
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:07,653
It's been a difficult process,

747
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,588
<i>But I wanted</i>
<i>to let you all know</i>

748
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:12,090
<i>Before we made</i>
<i>the formal announcement</i>

749
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:13,525
That as of 5:00 p.M.
Today,

750
00:31:13,593 --> 00:31:15,828
Our contract with atlanticnet
will be terminated.

751
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:17,896
<i>We've doubled</i>
<i>the number of</i>

752
00:31:17,964 --> 00:31:19,097
<i>Customer service</i>
<i>representatives</i>

753
00:31:19,165 --> 00:31:20,332
<i>In our call center.</i>

754
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,734
Current patients
will still be allowed

755
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:24,636
To remain in our care
for 30 days,

756
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:26,939
But starting tomorrow,
we will no longer

757
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:30,375
Be accepting patients with
atlanticnet health insurance.

758
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:35,013
[overlapping dialogue]

759
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:36,982
<i>(man)</i>
<i>why weren't we told</i>
<i>about this sooner?</i>

760
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:42,321
Come on, marina.

761
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:45,591
Pick up the phone.

762
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:46,892
I'm busy.

763
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:52,932
We found a liver match.
All right.

764
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,366
Get him prepped.

765
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:55,834
I'll straighten things out
with hourani.

766
00:31:55,902 --> 00:31:56,936
<i>Hourani's not the problem.</i>

767
00:31:57,003 --> 00:31:58,203
House is.

768
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:00,306
Now he wants chase
to do the surgery.

769
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:02,274
To prove to hourani
he doesn't need him?

770
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:03,442
To prove to thomas
that chase

771
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,044
Was his department's
best surgeon.

772
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:06,045
And what does chase
want to do?

773
00:32:06,112 --> 00:32:07,346
Chase wants to do the surgery.

774
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:08,781
And you don't want him
to do it because?

775
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:10,516
I don't care who does it.
So what's the problem?

776
00:32:10,584 --> 00:32:11,817
In order to get our patient
into the o.R.,

777
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:13,218
We have to get him
on the surgery schedule.

778
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:15,287
In order to do that,
we need someone to put him there

779
00:32:15,355 --> 00:32:17,389
<i>Who neither house</i>
<i>nor thomas can overrule.</i>

780
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:19,325
[sighs]

781
00:32:32,372 --> 00:32:34,340
What?

782
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:36,675
Would you rather
I go back on vicodin?

783
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:38,077
She's not massaging
your leg.

784
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,546
She will...Eventually.

785
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:42,381
Why am I the only person
here who cares

786
00:32:42,449 --> 00:32:44,249
What happens
to this hospital?

787
00:32:44,317 --> 00:32:47,553
<i>Get off your ass and get your</i>
<i>department under control.</i>

788
00:32:47,621 --> 00:32:49,622
At least for
the next few days.

789
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:52,358
Gonna take longer than
a few days for a company

790
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:54,560
The size of atlanticnet
to start feeling

791
00:32:54,628 --> 00:32:56,729
The squeeze
of your p.R. Campaign.

792
00:32:56,796 --> 00:32:57,930
If they ever do.

793
00:32:57,998 --> 00:32:59,264
And you know this how?

794
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:01,200
From all the time
you've spent researching them

795
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:02,601
And their other contracts?

796
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:04,036
The way they handle
their press relations?

797
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:05,471
I know
they have a nascar team.

798
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:07,606
Despite what you may have
learned at hebrew school

799
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:09,808
Or from jimmy cliff,

800
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:11,477
Sometimes the bigger
they are,

801
00:33:11,544 --> 00:33:14,713
The harder
they kick your ass.

802
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:23,689
I'm not
trying to be greedy.

803
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:25,057
<i>But he's</i>
<i>also not interested</i>

804
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,226
In being forced into
a medical bankruptcy.

805
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:31,063
Mr. Acevedo, I am sorry you're
having financial difficulties.

806
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:33,432
But because of us,
you still have a thumb.

807
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,235
I assume that's something
a carpenter might need.

808
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:38,070
<i>And I assume you didn't</i>
<i>ask for this meeting</i>

809
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:39,405
So you could lecture
my client.

810
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,708
You have insurance.

811
00:33:42,776 --> 00:33:44,243
But by filing this suit,

812
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,979
<i>You've caused us to get paid</i>
<i>nothing by them either.</i>

813
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:48,347
That's not our problem.
<i>Actually it is,</i>

814
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:49,882
Since he's responsible

815
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:51,483
For any expense
we're not reimbursed.

816
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:53,886
<i>But if you drop this suit</i>

817
00:33:53,953 --> 00:33:55,688
And make it clear
that dr. Chase was acting

818
00:33:55,755 --> 00:33:57,856
In your best interest
when he reattached your thumb,

819
00:33:57,924 --> 00:33:59,558
Then we'll be able
to resubmit the claim.

820
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:01,260
And you'll cover his
deductible,

821
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,295
Attorney's fees, and 50 grand
for pain and suffering?

822
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:05,197
Actually,
I was thinking more like

823
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:07,099
We'd cover
half his deductible,

824
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:09,435
Which means
you'd only owe $16,000.

825
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:11,503
You mean you
want him to pay you?

826
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:12,871
Yes.

827
00:34:12,939 --> 00:34:14,406
Do you have any idea
how much it costs?

828
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:17,609
How many years it takes to
train someone in microsurgery?

829
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:20,879
We gave you back your life.

830
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:22,314
You can still work.

831
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:24,416
You can button your own shirt,
hold a fork.

832
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:26,285
<i>Martin, let's go.</i>

833
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:27,786
I'm sorry.

834
00:34:27,854 --> 00:34:29,388
I know I should pay.

835
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:32,057
But I just can't.

836
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,193
I still cannot work.

837
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,361
I'm already underwater
on my house.

838
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:38,130
And I have
two kids with braces.

839
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:41,633
You think you'd be in
better shape without a thumb?

840
00:34:41,701 --> 00:34:43,035
Right now...

841
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:45,704
Financially? Yeah.

842
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:46,805
I would be.

843
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,409
Well, so would we.

844
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:52,077
But when you came in,
we didn't think about that,

845
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:54,046
We just took care of you.

846
00:34:54,114 --> 00:34:57,015
Made sure we did
whatever you needed to get well.

847
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,617
Yeah, right,
all you doctors care about

848
00:34:58,685 --> 00:35:00,285
Is healing.
[phone ringing]

849
00:35:00,353 --> 00:35:02,187
<i>That's why there's</i>
<i>all those bmws and porsches</i>

850
00:35:02,255 --> 00:35:03,522
<i>In the parking lot.</i>
Damn it.

851
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,590
Come on,
we're out of here.

852
00:35:04,657 --> 00:35:06,492
We'll see you in court.

853
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,860
You're right,
you will.

854
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:10,362
You still have
a thumb because of us.

855
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,430
And like everyone else
in this world,

856
00:35:11,498 --> 00:35:12,631
We don't work for free.

857
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:14,767
<i>We earn this money.</i>

858
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,268
And if we have to take
your house to get it,

859
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:17,436
We will.

860
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:22,775
[chatter]

861
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:26,011
What's going on?

862
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,212
I think
they're fighting.

863
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,382
Out of my way, now.
Out of my way.

864
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,718
[struggling noises]

865
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:34,953
What the hell is going on?

866
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:38,257
I told them
to use their words.

867
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:40,893
[loud whistle]

868
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,629
[heavy panting]

869
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,066
That pharm tech
is back.

870
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:50,536
She's in your office.

871
00:35:50,603 --> 00:35:52,204
You, there.
You, over there.

872
00:35:52,272 --> 00:35:53,972
I don't wanna hear a word
out of either one of you

873
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,809
Until I get back.

874
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:01,380
You lied.
So?

875
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:02,414
What're you gonna do

How doctor house forced me
to help him steal the meds

who he's having sex with

wants to speak to you.

The breast milk guy
finally found a doctor

893

To give him what he wanted.
