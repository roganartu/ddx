1
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:04,883
- We're starting a fund.
- Then you don't need me.

2
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:07,761
- The man's injured. He can't work.
- His fault.

3
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:14,509
We're family.
We depend on each other.

4
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:15,727
We're not family.

5
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:17,505
We're co-workers.

6
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,495
He's not even that anymore.

7
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:21,441
I can't believe you said that.

8
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:23,902
Can't come between a man
and his beer money.

9
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:26,571
- See the big, heavy machinery?
- I'm sorry,

10
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,651
but he should give.
You gave.

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:31,726
Go back to work.

12
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,705
Paolo is the one who got you
off the night shift.

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,608
It's not like I asked him.

14
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:45,548
Also covered for you
labor day weekend.

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,719
But hey, it's america.
If you don't want to contribu...

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,565
If you don't want to cont...

17
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:17,080
Oh, god!

18
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:21,469
Get an ambulance.

19
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:35,056
House - Season 5 Episode 08
"Emancipation"

20
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:41,896
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak

21
00:01:56,947 --> 00:02:00,457
www.house-fr.com

22
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,453
- Good morning.
- Don't wanna hear it.

23
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:10,425
So I take it you
did not ask Cuddy out.

24
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:12,761
- Yeah.
- Yeah "I didn't" or yeah "I did"?

25
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:15,930
Whichever one means you almost
had me convinced it was a good idea.

26
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,646
- Nothing to say?
- No.

27
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,940
No, you don't.
Or no, you don't don't?

28
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:27,756
Whichever one means no.

29
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:31,321
- Is this some kind of reverse...
- No.

30
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:34,121
House?

31
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:47,555
16-year-old girl
with fluid in her lungs.

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,725
No previous trauma, lung,
or cardiac issues.

33
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,050
Gram stain was negative.
No bacteria, no pneumonia.

34
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,305
She's a factory worker.
She probably works close

35
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,887
to a lot of recent immigrants.

36
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,849
Thank god some of those
offshore sweat shop jobs

37
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,392
are coming back to America.

38
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,144
She's an emancipated minor.

39
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,568
In a factory?

40
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:08,362
Either an olympic gymnast
who busted her leg,

41
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:11,319
a child star who blew
all her sequel money on drugs,

42
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:13,366
or she's just a lying runaway.

43
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:15,841
Her parents died last year.
No relatives.

44
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,896
To avoid foster care,
she got a G.E.D. and got emancipated.

45
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:21,113
Could've picked up a parasite
from a co-worker.

46
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:23,665
She'd be having G.I. Problems.
Pregnancy's more likely.

47
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:26,793
Sparks a fluid overload, hits the lungs,
causes the pulmonary edema.

48
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:28,336
She's not sexually active.

49
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,672
She could be lying.

50
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:32,840
But not every teenager
is having sex.

51
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,743
But every teenager is stupid.

52
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,594
Teenagers on their own are stupider.

53
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:38,971
The girl's holding down a job,
makes her rent.

54
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,599
On the one hand, kutner's right.

55
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:45,770
Maybe she's a sweet young thing,
not a screw-up lying through her teeth.

56
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:47,207
On the two hand,

57
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,088
a pregnancy test
only takes five minutes,

58
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,693
and we no longer kill rabbits.
So in conclusion,

59
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,980
Shut up, do the tests. What else?

60
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:56,427
Drugs could damage the heart.
Pressure imbalance allows fluid

61
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,491
- to build up in the lungs.
- Tox screen's clean.

62
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:01,911
For drugs used recently.
Not for drugs used before recently.

63
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,998
16 doesn't automatically mean
a risky lifestyle.

64
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,126
Didn't we just have this conversation?
Kutner trusts her. Someone else doesn't.

65
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,590
So, in conclusion, shut up.

66
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,506
Check her home and work
for toxins or drugs.

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,466
Kutner and foreman, do an echo.

68
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:17,844
Find the extent of the heart damage.

69
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,520
Kutner can do the echo on his own.

70
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,690
Yes... but he'll be very lonely.

71
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,605
So I have to ask why?

72
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,281
I've been asked to help run
a clinical trial.

73
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:41,075
That okay with you?

74
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:44,076
Good for your career.

75
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,289
Great for your street cred.
What's in it for me?

76
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:49,392
You have four doctors
and never more than one case.

77
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:51,903
It means I have time
to work on other things.

78
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:53,902
And they'll have
more chances to step up.

79
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,544
- Stand on their own.
- And if there's an emergency

80
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:57,871
with Annie,

81
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,386
Should she wait'til
you finish grooming lab rats?

82
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:03,090
If there's a problem with Sophia
or any other patient,

83
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:04,223
I'll be there.

84
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:05,975
The patient is my priority.

85
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:08,617
No.

86
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:15,471
Oh, do you want a reason?

87
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:18,404
Clinical trials take time.
Your time is my time.

88
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:32,836
I told you, I don't do drugs.

89
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:36,339
Still a good idea to check your heart.
Something else could have damaged it.

90
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,800
You find it hard
being all on your own?

91
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,803
- Having to do everything without...
- Drugs to ease my pain?

92
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,445
- That's not what...
- Teenager on her own?

93
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,932
I wouldn't trust me either.

94
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:48,059
I meant it must be hard.

95
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:52,021
No one there to back you up.

96
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:55,441
I know you're trying to be nice,
but I'm not into the whole pity thing.

97
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,610
I was actually doing
the "I get it" thing.

98
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,862
I lost my parents when I was six.

99
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:02,031
It doesn't go away.

100
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,326
But it gets easier.
You learn to deal.

101
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:11,457
I still get nervous when there's
a knock on the door.

102
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,252
Always think
it's the state trooper...

103
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:16,921
With more bad news.

104
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,633
You already got the worst news
and survived. That's sorta the upside.

105
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:27,158
Your heart's healthy.

106
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:29,267
Isn't that good news?

107
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:31,635
For your heart, yeah.

108
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,605
But it also means we still
don't know what's wrong.

109
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,488
Checkbook balanced, place spotless.

110
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,297
Looks like she builds
her own furniture.

111
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:45,408
If you're this grown up at 16,
what happens at 30?

112
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:48,327
You turn back into a kid.
Like Kutner.

113
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:49,743
Kutner's not that bad.

114
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,712
He needs everything to be nice.

115
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:54,013
He wants to see
the best in everyone.

116
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:57,003
- Kitchen's clear.
- Yeah, friendly is a dangerous thing.

117
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,025
There is such a thing
as too trusting.

118
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,008
Corollary is there is such a thing
as not trusting enough.

119
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,676
Too much, you get hurt.

120
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,805
Not enough, you don't live.

121
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:09,497
So the object in life is to get hurt
just the right amount?

122
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:11,435
Excuse me if I don't go
out of my way

123
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,705
to take relationship advice
from you.

124
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:15,594
And trust...

125
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,605
Should be earned.

126
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,697
Bong means nothing.
Drugs are irrelevant.

127
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,601
- Relevant if she's taking them.
- Even if she is: irrelevant.

128
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:31,253
Echo showed no heart damage.

129
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:35,208
Would that be the echo that Foreman
choose not to run with you

130
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:38,752
after I dashed his
new drug discovery dreams?

131
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:41,181
You mad at me because you think
kutner screwed up the echo?

132
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:44,467
- I didn't screw up the echo.
- I know. No structural heart damage.

133
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:47,095
- So if it's not the heart...
- It's the heart.

134
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,910
Didn't you just say it's not?

135
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,241
Not all heart damage
has to be structural.

136
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,721
Drugs could have caused
intermittent tachycardia.

137
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:56,058
Irregular heartbeat would
account for the pulmonary edema.

138
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:58,064
Edema was acute.
Vasculitis makes more sense.

139
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:00,858
No sign in her blood work.
If she had vasculitis, she'd be too weak

140
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,276
to work in a factory.

141
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,512
She builds her own furniture.
You think she skips work

142
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:07,428
because she's feeling a little weak?
She needs steroids.

143
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,547
Steroids could cause
an irregular heartbeat,

144
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:12,120
making her current one
irregular-er-er.

145
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,586
Start her on beta-blockers.

146
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:17,430
The rest of you, do anything

147
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:20,145
that isn't starting her
on beta-blockers.

148
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:27,320
Start her on the treatment.
Page me if you need me.

149
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,680
Irregular heartbeat causes blood
to back up behind the heart

150
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,603
and into the lungs. Beta-blockers
keep this from happening.

151
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:39,480
I thought my heart was fine.

152
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,774
It's tricky.
An arrhythmia can come and go.

153
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:45,276
So you don't believe me or the test.

154
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:49,031
You guys are more cynical than I am.

155
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:52,834
We found the bong in your apartment.

156
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:54,662
You went into my apartment?

157
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:56,203
Extended drug use can...

158
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,790
The bong belongs to my ex.

159
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,625
It's why he's ex.

160
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:02,049
That doesn't mean you didn't use it.

161
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,267
No.

162
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,807
You have no reason to trust me.

163
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:10,301
You have to do your treatment.

164
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:16,350
The other possibility is
you have vasculitis.

165
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,977
The treatment is steroids.

166
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:20,623
If you've been using drugs,
if they've damaged your heart

167
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:23,439
and I start you on steroids,
they could kill you.

168
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,825
I haven't used drugs.

169
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,935
I'll get the steroids.

170
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:45,566
Why are you here?

171
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,880
- I owe clinic hours.
- No, you don't.

172
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:50,591
I'm here `cause House
doesn't want me to be here.

173
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:53,052
I'm guessing he said no
to the clinical trials.

174
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,015
He didn't need to say no.
He just wanted to say no.

175
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,748
House did something solely
out of self-interest?

176
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:00,019
That's freaky.

177
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,647
- Don't suppose you'd want to override?
- No.

178
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:06,084
What do you think
this is gonna prove?

179
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:09,050
Does it matter? Just figured
you could use some help down here.

180
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,068
And you spending two hours
wiping noses will annoy House.

181
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,101
If that is your dream, god bless.

182
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:17,286
If you want to prove you can do
his job and something more...

183
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:27,243
His puke is red.
That's blood, right?

184
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:31,557
That hurt?

185
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,177
What about that?

186
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,210
Four days he's been like this.
It's just getting worse.

187
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,895
- Maybe he just needs to poop.
- Evan!

188
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:40,963
What?

189
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,963
Worked last time
I had a stomach ache.

190
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:44,480
It's actually a smart idea.

191
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:47,231
Which is why that's the first thing
the other doctors checked.

192
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,068
His insides are clear.

193
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:51,479
- Anyone else sick in daycare?
- No.

194
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:54,448
- How'bout his friends?
- No. No one. What's happening?

195
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:56,403
Not sure yet.

196
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,869
Don't worry. I've got an idea.

197
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,749
You can make him better, right?

198
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:05,917
That's my plan.

199
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:08,045
You need to make him better.

200
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,571
Stay the hell away from me!

201
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:16,804
Just calm down.

202
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:19,348
- What happened?
- I adjusted her iv, she went crazy.

203
00:11:19,508 --> 00:11:21,776
- Don't touch me! Leave me alone!
- Sophia, it's OK.

204
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,775
- We're here to help you.
- Stay away from me! Don't touch me!

205
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,773
I said don't...

206
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:30,359
Get your hands off of me!

207
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:32,194
Get your...

208
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:34,619
Beta-blockers don't cause
psychotic breaks.

209
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:36,697
She's not on beta-blockers.

210
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:47,583
We started her on haloperidol.
She's stable.

211
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:50,554
Lab tests showed the delirium
wasn't caused by a metabolic problem.

212
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,865
- We don't know what caused it.
- Yeah, we do.

213
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,092
- Nice job, Foreman.
- I didn't switch her meds.

214
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:57,579
But your decision
to stick it to the man,

215
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,805
clearly inspired oliver twist.

216
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:02,141
I treated her based
on the symptoms she presented.

217
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:04,685
You treated her based on
empathetic orphan syndrome,

218
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:06,576
and almost killed her
in the process.

219
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:09,438
She wasn't on steroids long enough
for it to cause the delirium.

220
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,024
- It's a new symptom.
- One that rules out vasculitis.

221
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:13,253
And arrhythmia.

222
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:16,655
The psychotic break caused a surge
of adrenaline, no irregular heartbeat.

223
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:18,823
Heart's not the problem.
We're both wrong.

224
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:23,704
So what causes lung issues
and delirium?

225
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,291
And is not based on wishful thinking
that she's safe and happy?

226
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:30,501
Prinzmetal angina.

227
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:36,967
Silent and unhappy is better
than vocal and unhelpful.

228
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,484
If you'd run the echo
that you didn't run,

229
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:41,724
giving her the beta-blockers
that you didn't give,

230
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:44,127
If you'd listened what kutner
said, it's not a heart problem.

231
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:46,268
I'm not talking about her heart
but about her head.

232
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:47,964
Prinzmetal angina doesn't affect...

233
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:50,818
No reason it couldn't cause
an artery in the brain to spasm.

234
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:53,399
Leads to the delirium
and the pulmonary edema.

235
00:12:57,453 --> 00:13:00,531
Foreman, give her ergonovine
to cause vasospasms,

236
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:02,761
and run an FMRI to see
which artery's dancing.

237
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,952
And when I say Foreman,
I mean... Foreman.

238
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,830
I want his signature on the paperwork.
I want videotape.

239
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:11,460
I want photographs of him
with the patient and today's newspaper.

240
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,563
- Set her up. When you're ready...
- House wants you...

241
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:17,840
To do the procedure.

242
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:20,219
When you get everything set up,
page me.

243
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,828
That's really a camera?

244
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:33,105
Pretty cool?

245
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:35,936
This can go places
the other scopes can't.

246
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:40,154
- I need you to swallow this pill.
- Don't wanna.

247
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,114
It doesn't hurt. Promise.

248
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:45,807
Jonah, please.

249
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,956
To help make you better.

250
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,586
I don't want to be mean,

251
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:53,001
but if you don't do this,
we'll have to make you.

252
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,564
It's a power pill.
It's not just a camera.

253
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:58,547
It makes your muscles grow.

254
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,223
Like the vitamins we take.

255
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:03,804
Except this was made
with a secret formula.

256
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,985
- You did great, sweetheart.
- You're very brave.

257
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:19,318
Jonah's lucky.

258
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,757
I was pretty cruel to my little brother
when I was your age.

259
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,074
Why?

260
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,827
I guess I thought
that's what big brothers did.

261
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:28,569
Obviously, I was wrong.

262
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:31,241
Is he a doctor too?

263
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,488
Does the pill tickle, sweetie?

264
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:40,214
He can't feel it.

265
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:42,252
What's funny, your brother?

266
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:50,351
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

267
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:56,732
How you guys getting along?

268
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,937
And you suddenly care why?

269
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:01,789
House was asking questions
last week.

270
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:05,306
Foreman needs us, and he's worried
that if we snip, we might be distracted.

271
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,868
- That's kind of insulting, isn't it?
- Very.

272
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:09,580
You're obviously fine.

273
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,007
I need a differential
for uncontrollable giggling.

274
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:16,533
He's four.
They laugh.

275
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:21,700
Nothing like diarrhea and bloody vomit
to put you in the mood to goof around.

276
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:23,578
I've looked down one end
and up the other.

277
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,388
All the tests came back clean.

278
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:27,161
- I can't figure this out.
- You can't?

279
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,765
Don't you work with 3 other doctors
and a grouchy gimp?

280
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,559
This isn't House's case.

281
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:41,233
Just so you know,
whatever you're trying to prove,

282
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,694
it won't be enough.

283
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:46,073
Gotta go.

284
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:57,751
- Sorry.
- You didn't Miss much.

285
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:58,913
No spasms yet.

286
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:01,731
Nothing in the anterior
or posterior cerebral arteries.

287
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,467
How much longer?

288
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,322
Just a few more minutes.

289
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,122
Were your foster homes
all around here,

290
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:10,072
- or did you have to change schools?
- Is chatting about lousy foster parents

291
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:11,305
supposed to relax me?

292
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:14,057
Left middle cerebral artery
looks good.

293
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:15,814
My foster parents were great.

294
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:18,897
I think most foster parents do it
because they want to do a decent thing.

295
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,607
Which is why you didn't
get emancipated.

296
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:25,027
Nothing around the vertebral artery.
No sign of spasms.

297
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:27,207
But that's odd.

298
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:30,449
How'd you find out
about your parents?

299
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:32,831
I told you.
State trooper.

300
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:34,745
Look at that.

301
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,956
Arteries are fine.
You can stop.

302
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:38,724
Not that.

303
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,715
I forget, did he come to your house
or call you down to the station?

304
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,343
Came to my house.

305
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,038
I cried into the guy's shirt
for an hour.

306
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,366
Fmris tell us
where the blood flow is.

307
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:57,351
You were using your limbic region.
It lights when we use our imagination.

308
00:16:57,555 --> 00:17:00,069
It doesn't light up
when we're telling the truth.

309
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:02,606
Your parents aren't dead, are they?

310
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,885
I risked my job, put you
on a different treatment...

311
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,323
- I didn't lie about the drugs.
- Why lie about your parents?

312
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:11,045
Because I wish they were dead.

313
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:16,165
I got emancipated
because my dad raped me.

314
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:20,459
And my mom pretended
it didn't happen.

315
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:30,694
No signs of spasm,
impeded blood flow,

316
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:32,003
or brain dysfunction.

317
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:35,222
It's not prinzmetals.
All the fmri showed is House was right.

318
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:36,724
She was lying.

319
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:40,854
Only relevant if it can cause
pulmonary edema and delirium.

320
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:43,898
We find out our patient's been raped,
and that's your response?

321
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,598
Is she a psych patient?

322
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:47,865
Rape could mean std.

323
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,614
Thank goodness one of you
doesn't have a heart.

324
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:54,825
Maybe if we stopped wringing our hands,
we could solve this thing

325
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,694
and let her live to have
more nightmares.

326
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:00,497
Gonococcal endocarditis would explain
the pulmonary edema, the delirium.

327
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:02,713
No sign in her bloodwork.

328
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,232
Could be lying about the rape.

329
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:11,383
Yesterday, you were all bff.
Now you think she's pathological.

330
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:13,054
Yesterday I had no reason to doubt.

331
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,914
If she'd been honest
from the beginning...

332
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,308
She lied about dead parents
because it's better than rapist parents.

333
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,664
- You find that unsympathetic?
- That's it.

334
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:23,165
- What's it?
- Her whole life's a mess.

335
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,606
What rhymes with mess?

336
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:29,528
It's not stress. She has none
of the usual manifestations.

337
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,467
No hormone imbalance, no cardiac...

338
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:33,737
She's drowning in her own lungs,
and she's delirious.

339
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,407
She's a picture of emotional health.

340
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,791
Severe emotional stress

341
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,824
can lead to asymmetric function
of the midbrain.

342
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:41,873
Explains the delirium.
Interruption of the brain-heart coupling

343
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:43,801
could cause pulmonary edema.

344
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,483
Even if He is wrong, the treatment's
basically anti-anxiety meds.

345
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:49,331
Hard to argue with.

346
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:52,551
Yes. I agree.
It does explain everything.

347
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,865
13, load her up on diazepam.
Foreman, make sure she does it.

348
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:59,771
Thirteen, make sure he makes sure.

349
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:06,667
I went to Cuddy's house.

350
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:09,744
But I didn't go in.

351
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:12,778
Went home without ringing either

352
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:14,865
her metaphorical or actual bell.

353
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:19,952
You're processing.

354
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,046
I'm scrubbing.

355
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:26,620
- "Huh" means processing.
- "Huh" means acknowledging.

356
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,857
If you prefer, I could say "ha",
or "hmm," or...

357
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:31,797
No insights?
No opinions?

358
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,468
You're disappointed.
You made the decision.

359
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,388
I can't tell you
what's right for you.

360
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:41,016
Seriously?
'cause last week you could.

361
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,318
Last year you could.
Seems to come pretty easy to you.

362
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,991
Do you want me to tell you
what you should do?

363
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,898
I want you to stop thinking
that acting inscrutable

364
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,692
makes you anything
other than annoying.

365
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,196
Interesting.

366
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:02,771
Holding things in
can give you cancer!

367
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:06,484
Kid's in daycare.
Could be meningitis.

368
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,664
No fever, no stiffness, no rash.

369
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,031
You check his thyroid?

370
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:13,298
TSH and 3 t4 were within range.
Ruled out all the usual suspects.

371
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:16,760
Nothing's usual for a four-year-old,
and it feels like we're your goomah.

372
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,332
Your feelings are hurt?

373
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:20,337
Either you can handle
these cases or you can't.

374
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:23,737
- If you can't, it's dangerous.
- On the other hand, stomach cancer.

375
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,185
Leiomyosarcoma.

376
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:26,948
Long shot.

377
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:29,105
Altered mental status means
porphyria's more likely.

378
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,482
No abdominal pain?

379
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:33,089
Cancer explains the lethargy,
the gi symptoms...

380
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:34,603
Neither's perfect.

381
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:36,759
Then we test for both.

382
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:39,574
And by "we," you mean
the collective "not you."

383
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,875
Thanks.

384
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:46,828
Severe stress scrambles
the way the brain

385
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,625
communicates with the rest
of the body.

386
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:50,421
I have a problem with my brain?

387
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:53,338
Not exactly. The problem would be
with your body chemistry.

388
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,756
- Where's Dr. Kutner?
- There's four of us. It's my turn.

389
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:02,681
I'm sorry I lied about my parents.

390
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:06,940
You did what you thought
you had to do to protect yourself.

391
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,939
If we're right, we should see
a change in your lungs pretty fast.

392
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:13,828
Then we can figure out
how to manage your stress.

393
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:15,789
It might help to turn him in.

394
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:17,903
File a police report, get closure.

395
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,453
Won't help.

396
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,742
Not addressing what happened
won't make it go away.

397
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:27,439
What do I have to do
to make it go away?

398
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,051
- I didn't mean that. I just mean...
- I addressed it. I got away from him.

399
00:21:34,352 --> 00:21:36,303
Reporting it just labels me.

400
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,799
"Girl raped by Dad."

401
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,969
- It doesn't have to define you.
- It's how you see me.

402
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:44,639
That's why you're treating me
with tranquilizers.

403
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:46,405
Not anymore.

404
00:21:47,502 --> 00:21:49,618
Stress wouldn't change
your urine color.

405
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,733
Labs show the brown urine
was caused by shredded red cells.

406
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:05,802
So what messes with her lungs,
her mental status,

407
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:08,250
and runs her blood
through a wood chipper?

408
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,304
Factory lunch rooms
aren't the cleanest places.

409
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,677
- Coulda picked up e. Coli.
- Or Shigella from the restroom.

410
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:14,877
Either would account
for the red cells, the delirium.

411
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,175
But not the original lung symptoms.
Legionnaire's could, and cause delirium.

412
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,176
- No, her sodium's normal.
- What does her furniture look like?

413
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:28,348
Said it was homemade.
Old boxes, what?

414
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,811
It was wood nailed together.

415
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:33,188
The wood have little dents or holes?

416
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:35,595
I didn't see any in the bookshelves,
but they were painted.

417
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,690
The desk did.

418
00:22:36,852 --> 00:22:38,860
Looked like she had stapled
stuff all over it.

419
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:41,413
Holes means that it
was pressure-treated.

420
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:45,010
Sawing or burning it releases
arsenic into the air.

421
00:22:45,135 --> 00:22:47,244
- Into her lungs.
- Tests didn't show...

422
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:49,664
Because it found a cloak
of invisibility hiding...

423
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:51,599
Arsenic gets absorbed
in the internal organs

424
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:53,999
so it doesn't show up
in the blood tests. Test her hair.

425
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:56,743
If it's positive,
chelate it out of her blood.

426
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,970
No cancer, no porphyria.

427
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:09,299
You paged me
with negative test results?

428
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:11,288
Yes, because it means we're done.

429
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:15,022
Since we still don't know what's wrong,
this kid has a real problem.

430
00:23:15,536 --> 00:23:17,733
- Talk to House?
- Not his case.

431
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:24,112
There's a point when Cameron
and I aren't enough.

432
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,782
We're not there.

433
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:30,094
We need to run some more tests.

434
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:36,024
A week ago, he was a happy little boy
playing with his brother,

435
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:37,876
and now he can barely lift his head.

436
00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:40,712
We'll figure this out.
I just need...

437
00:23:40,874 --> 00:23:41,874
Help!

438
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,466
We need a crash cart!

439
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:47,846
- What's going on?
- He's in cardiac arrest.

440
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:49,291
Get them outta here.

441
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:00,101
Clear.

442
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,360
Nothing. Go again.

443
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Clear.

444
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,085
He's back.

445
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:12,412
We're there.

446
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:24,339
Chelation's complete.

447
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,427
- You're arsenic-free.
- So I can get outta here?

448
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:29,282
In the morning.

449
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:32,220
That's it?

450
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:34,645
No advice?

451
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:37,077
No "be careful out there, kiddo"?

452
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:39,564
You want my advice?

453
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:43,154
Want is one thing, expect's another.

454
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:49,531
I wish I could tell you what to do.

455
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:52,119
But you're strong.
You've make good choices.

456
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,071
You'll be fine.

457
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:56,881
Thanks.

458
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:10,385
Need four milligrams lorazepam!

459
00:25:21,304 --> 00:25:23,561
After the seizure we run a new MRI.

460
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:25,861
This is sophia's brain
three days ago,

461
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,154
this is her brain today.

462
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,241
Lesions.

463
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:36,180
Magical lesions,
which appear out of nowhere.

464
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,377
She was cured, then she wasn't.

465
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:43,044
- Lesions grew too fast for cancer.
- Could be infection. Mrsa.

466
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:45,202
WBC count would be through the roof.

467
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:46,713
Put the arsenic back.

468
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,423
You wanna treat a patient

469
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:50,635
nearly poisoned to death
by giving her more poison?

470
00:25:50,972 --> 00:25:54,097
Just because we call something a poison
doesn't mean it's bad for you.

471
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:56,709
- It was killing her.
- But since she's still dying,

472
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,456
the arsenic wasn't killing her.

473
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:02,668
And since she's getting worse,
the arsenic was fighting the killer.

474
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:04,343
It's a hero.

475
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:06,985
We should be organizing a parade.

476
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,144
So what does arsenic treat?

477
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:12,864
Syphilis. Before penicillin,
the treatment was arsenic.

478
00:26:13,368 --> 00:26:15,660
We already ruled out STDs,
and even if we were wrong,

479
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,553
that much arsenic in her system
would've wiped out the syphilis.

480
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:21,195
Acute promyelocytic leukemia's
still treated with arsenic.

481
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,099
APL explains the lesions
and why they appeared

482
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:26,381
after we took the arsenic out.

483
00:26:27,248 --> 00:26:28,783
So, put the arsenic back.

484
00:26:28,908 --> 00:26:30,192
We still have a problem.

485
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:32,424
Arsenic slows leukemia,
but it can't cure it.

486
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,214
If she wants to see 17, she's gonna need
a bone marrow transplant.

487
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,722
Best match would be
a sibling or a parent.

488
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:41,084
Biopsy a lesion,
confirm that she's dying,

489
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,097
then load her up with arsenic.

490
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,917
Keep her alive till you can
convince her that rapist marrow

491
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:50,234
and rapist-enabling marrow
work just as well as the unleaded stuff.

492
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,337
We need to talk.

493
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:59,017
This about the case
you didn't want me to know about?

494
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:05,630
You didn't flinch when you found out
about a 16-year-old who could be dying

495
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:07,023
in the next few days.

496
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:10,671
Means you're here about someone
even younger dying even faster.

497
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:12,220
He needs you.

498
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,089
But he has you.

499
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:21,101
This boy is going to die.

500
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:24,319
- You selfish enough to let it happen?
- Pot calling a kettle a pot?

501
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:25,588
You're a hypocrite.

502
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:29,013
If our job is to find out what's killing
patients, you'd help this kid.

503
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:32,389
But you prefer play mind games to prove
you're the only one with magical powers.

504
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:34,695
Wanted something all your own?
Now you got it.

505
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,616
Your disengagement won't work.

506
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:40,139
- I can see that.
- You think

507
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:42,833
that when you tell what I should do,
my instincts are to push back,

508
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,139
so that by not telling
what you think I should do,

509
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,750
- I'll do what you think I should do.
- I sound convoluted.

510
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:50,044
Disengagement is neither
artful nor effective.

511
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:54,381
So my not doing anything
isn't causing you to do anything?

512
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:55,567
Right.

513
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,178
I'm okay with that.

514
00:27:57,735 --> 00:27:58,993
No, you're not.

515
00:27:59,118 --> 00:28:02,556
You are designed to have opinions
and to force them on people.

516
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:05,683
I'm starting to sound desperate.

517
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:08,769
Don't screw with my stuff.

518
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:16,986
I just need a donor with the
same blood type or something, right?

519
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,363
Actually,
bone marrow's a little more complex.

520
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,491
The best donors
are immediate family.

521
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:26,287
But those donor banks
have thousands of names.

522
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:28,753
Your parents'similar dna

523
00:28:28,878 --> 00:28:30,647
- gives you a much better chan...
- No.

524
00:28:32,022 --> 00:28:33,345
If I do this,

525
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:36,881
I'll owe my life to them.

526
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,136
It'd mean everything else
that had happened was somehow okay.

527
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:44,863
They don't deserve that.

528
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,879
They're not in my life.

529
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:51,020
If that means I'm dead,
then I'm dead.

530
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,361
I have Huntington's disease.

531
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:01,614
I'm dying.

532
00:29:03,087 --> 00:29:06,911
I don't know when it'll happen,
but it'll be sooner than I ever planned.

533
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,266
And I'd do anything to stop it.

534
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,625
Because the only way
to make anything right,

535
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:15,669
the only way to make
your life matter

536
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,077
is to live as long

537
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:20,888
and as well as you possibly can.

538
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:28,307
Have you ever been raped?

539
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:33,113
No.

540
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:38,014
Don't try to walk in my shoes
and I won't try to walk in yours.

541
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,660
- You had no right.
- To convince her to do the right thing?

542
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,392
- To lie to her.
- It's a true story.

543
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:50,791
Who cares if it's not mine?

544
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,384
- It's my life.
- It's her life.

545
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:54,834
Point wasn't I'm dying.
Point was she should live.

546
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,218
You should have told her.

547
00:29:56,343 --> 00:29:59,171
Instead you tell her to call the cops,
give her stats on DNA markers.

548
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,632
Everything's by the book.
Nothing's ever personal.

549
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,260
Trying to sleep here!

550
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:07,805
Biopsy confirmed APL.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

551
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:11,475
Run the donor banks.
I'm going home.

552
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:14,270
We need to track down her parents.

553
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:18,914
I assume she's already
said no to that idea,

554
00:30:19,612 --> 00:30:22,236
or there'd be no need to screw up
your courage before saying it.

555
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,547
Children who've been through
trauma can't think clearly.

556
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:26,365
Those who are dying...

557
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,532
Guess I'm the only one
caring about patient rights.

558
00:30:28,657 --> 00:30:31,745
- What she wants could kill her.
- What she needs could save her.

559
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,208
Our job is to find out
what's killing patients,

560
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,334
- not treat them for chronic idiocy.
- Idiocy is what's killing her.

561
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,295
Since we can't cure that,
I'm going home.

562
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,506
We could save this patient, but all
you care about is getting your answer.

563
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:46,844
Your point being?

564
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,346
Taub and Kutner can
check the donor banks.

565
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:52,105
I'm gonna find her parents.

566
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:56,774
Can't see why you're surprised.

567
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,631
You push against house,
he's pushing back.

568
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,069
Against me, I get.
His ego's killing my patient.

569
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,590
You liked this case because
he wasn't looming over you.

570
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:04,982
The decisions were yours.

571
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:07,472
Only difference now
is he decided not to loom.

572
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:10,243
Doesn't change the fact
that your patient's dying.

573
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,703
What are we missing?
What's not in the file?

574
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,456
The mother,
overburdened at the end of her rope.

575
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:18,841
Makes her kid sick so someone
else will take care of him.

576
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:21,420
- Sympathize with her.
- Munchausen by proxy?

577
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,590
She brought him into the clinic, was
here when he went into cardiac arrest.

578
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:27,017
The brother would have noticed,
said something.

579
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:29,094
Evan's even more
protective than she is.

580
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:32,139
- Then maybe it's the brother.
- He's eight.

581
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,885
- Could be jealous.
- He's the opposite of jealous.

582
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:37,572
He includes jonah
in everything he does.

583
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:39,972
Makes sure he eats,
brushes his teeth.

584
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,817
I think we gave him an idea.

585
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:50,381
Either that or he's
off to kill house.

586
00:31:58,587 --> 00:31:59,416
M. Velez?

587
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:04,216
I'm Dr. Remy Hadley from
Princeton-Plainsboro hospital.

588
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:07,341
We're treating your daughter,
Sophia, for leukemia

589
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:10,844
and we need to test both you and
your wife for bone marrow donation.

590
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:13,722
I'm sorry, you said you
were from Princeton-Plainsboro?

591
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,518
I know this is unexpected,
but time is short and...

592
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,655
What's going on?

593
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:21,188
This doctor says you have leukemia.

594
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,233
I don't have leukemia.

595
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,095
Sophia velez?

596
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,469
Yeah?

597
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:31,698
Sophia isabel velez?

598
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:33,516
Yeah.

599
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:36,120
Do you know something I don't?

600
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:41,205
Just that liars lie.

601
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:47,840
You stole her identity.

602
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,578
To protect myself.

603
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,006
- So they can't find me.
- We can protect you.

604
00:32:53,131 --> 00:32:54,998
But we need to find your parents.

605
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:56,098
Why?

606
00:32:56,951 --> 00:32:59,346
You have my blood.
You don't need my name to find a donor.

607
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:00,437
You're a minor.

608
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:02,563
You forged the emancipation papers.

609
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,050
Even if we had a donor,

610
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:06,755
we'd still need your parents'
consent to treat you.

611
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:10,151
Can't you just pretend
you didn't go to that house?

612
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,032
That you didn't find that girl?

613
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:21,022
Calling your parents
doesn't mean a family reunion.

614
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:24,926
You don't even have to see them.

615
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,635
When I get sick enough,
it'll be an emergency.

616
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:35,218
When I get sick enough,
it'll be an emergency.

617
00:33:35,635 --> 00:33:37,960
You'll have to give me a transplant.

618
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:40,017
Even without consent.

619
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:52,738
An iron overdose?

620
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,440
From his vitamins.

621
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,261
If I'm right,
we can treat him tonight.

622
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:59,446
He'll be back to his
old self in the morning.

623
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,571
But...

624
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:05,074
they're children's vitamins.

625
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:07,002
I... I only give him one.

626
00:34:07,514 --> 00:34:08,514
I know.

627
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:16,011
I thought more would
make him strong.

628
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:21,622
I didn't mean to make him sick.

629
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:24,936
He's gonna be okay.

630
00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:30,648
He's gonna hate me.

631
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:34,655
Well, that's the great
thing about brothers.

632
00:34:36,886 --> 00:34:39,326
You can make mistakes,
and they'll still love you.

633
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:01,137
Donor list turned
up a partial match.

634
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:02,137
So treat her.

635
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:04,012
It's only a three out of six.

636
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:06,346
- So don't treat her.
- She may not last the week.

637
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,139
Partial's better than nothing.

638
00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:09,824
- So treat her.
- She'll reject it.

639
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:12,938
And she'll be too weak to try
again when a better match turns up.

640
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,762
- It's my turn now, right?
- If a better match turns up.

641
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:18,240
Well, when you decide,
get back to me.

642
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:24,417
She's scared.

643
00:35:25,987 --> 00:35:27,606
Not scared enough.

644
00:35:28,177 --> 00:35:30,269
Tell her the thing about
emotional reactions is

645
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,693
they're definitionally irrational.

646
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,302
Or stupid.

647
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:37,246
Might wanna phrase
that in your own words.

648
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:40,075
She wants to deny her parents
the satisfaction of saving her life.

649
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,093
That's your rational explanation
of her emotional response.

650
00:35:43,218 --> 00:35:44,558
That was her explanation.

651
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:49,021
That makes sense.

652
00:35:49,545 --> 00:35:51,190
How long before
she came up with that?

653
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,816
It was her immediate reaction.

654
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,440
That doesn't make sense.

655
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:57,946
The fact that it makes
sense doesn't make sense?

656
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,763
Emotional is immediate.

657
00:35:59,888 --> 00:36:01,638
She went to rational first.

658
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:03,869
Means there was no
emotional to process.

659
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,538
You're saying she's
lying about being raped?

660
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,881
Wouldn't be her first.

661
00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:10,709
She lied about one trauma
to cover a worse trauma.

662
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:13,951
So...

663
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:16,447
What's worse than rape?

664
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,292
I'm Dr. House.

665
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,179
What did you do?

666
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:34,369
- I don't...
- Something happened,

667
00:36:34,637 --> 00:36:35,690
but it wasn't rape.

668
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:39,325
Believe whatever you want.

669
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,865
You're scared, and stubborn,

670
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,023
and you don't like people
feeling sorry for you.

671
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:46,328
- Why not?
- I don't want pity.

672
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:48,972
I just wanna be normal.

673
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:51,526
But you know you're not.

674
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:55,546
You need people to see how
independent you are,

675
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,118
how well you're coping.

676
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:01,539
So they won't see the lost,
hurt little girl.

677
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:07,101
Because that's not what you see.

678
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,631
You see someone
who did something terrible...

679
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:15,435
who deserves to suffer.

680
00:37:15,843 --> 00:37:17,839
Who doesn't deserve to live.

681
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,297
What did you do?

682
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:34,774
Eventually,
we'll find your parents...

683
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:36,545
if only to deliver the body.

684
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:40,591
Then they won't care.

685
00:37:40,996 --> 00:37:42,050
You're an idiot.

686
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,207
You'd rather die than face
your parents because,

687
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:48,056
what, you broke their Faberg egg?

688
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,777
I killed their son.

689
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,717
I killed my brother.

690
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,088
I was supposed to watch him.

691
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:05,360
He was in the bath.

692
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,690
I could hear him laughing.

693
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:19,407
Every time they look at me,
it's like I kill him again.

694
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:39,881
If you don't take your
parents'bone marrow...

695
00:38:41,162 --> 00:38:43,524
you'd be killing their other child.

696
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:46,990
If they don't hate you now,
they will then.

697
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:51,552
I don't care.

698
00:38:53,152 --> 00:38:54,363
Sure you do.

699
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:00,777
You want someone to tell
you it was just an accident.

700
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:03,513
That it's not that bad,
but it is that bad.

701
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:05,550
And you know it.

702
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:08,748
There's nothing you
can do to change that.

703
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:15,413
But there is one thing you can do

704
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,559
to not make it worse.

705
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:10,967
If you're here to celebrate the kid's
bone marrow transplant working,

706
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,677
you missed cake.

707
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,262
I want to do clinical trials.

708
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:17,015
Already had this conversation.

709
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,840
I've proved that I
can work two cases at once.

710
00:41:19,965 --> 00:41:21,029
I can do this.

711
00:41:21,154 --> 00:41:22,275
And I'm doing it.

712
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,033
Okay.

713
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:26,722
Okay?

714
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:28,360
Just like that?

715
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:31,344
Can I give my reasons
later... or never?

716
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,490
Three days ago you said no.

717
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:36,709
Three days ago you asked me.

718
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:38,528
Now you told me.

719
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:41,249
Can't say no if it's not a question.

720
00:42:10,593 --> 00:42:12,656
Nice thing you did for foreman.

721
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,179
He speaks.

722
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,129
He deflects.

723
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:23,107
I almost cost a
four-year-old his life.

724
00:42:23,547 --> 00:42:25,980
Well, you knew foreman
would figure it out.

725
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:27,469
Did i?

726
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:34,405
You just needed to prove it to him.

727
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,594
You're an ass.

728
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,057
But a noble one.

729
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:38,845
I sound clever.

730
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,550
Thank you.

731
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:42,767
Your little game didn't work.

732
00:42:43,037 --> 00:42:45,461
I'm not foreman, and you're not me.

733
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:52,596
You wanna talk about her?

734
00:42:54,024 --> 00:42:55,024
Nope.

735
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,095
All right.

736
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,249
You're gonna be okay, house.

737
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:05,805
Good to know.
