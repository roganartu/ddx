1
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,196
Ugh. I think I'm gonna puke.

2
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:40,631
Not on this dress.

3
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:41,879
I'm serious.

4
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:45,259
Kate Moss was doing this at 13.
You have two years on her.

5
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:49,380
Yeah, that's what I like to see.
You got this.

6
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:52,225
Next show, you're bride.

7
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:55,681
Did Austin just offer you bride?

8
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,648
It wasn't a real offer, Dad.
He was just being nice.

9
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:01,443
These shoes are gonna
be impossible to walk in.

10
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,511
You've done this
a hundred times before,
all right?

11
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,026
The runway's just
a little bit longer here.

12
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:06,987
One of the girls said
Madonna's in the front row.

13
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:09,476
Sweetie, sweetie,
hey, come on, come on.

14
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:11,542
You gonna be able
to do this? Hmm?

15
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,686
All right, come here, come here.

16
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:20,385
Here, hold this.

17
00:01:21,238 --> 00:01:23,771
The doctor gave me these
for anxiety, all right.

18
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:25,856
It'll calm you down. Here.

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,665
Come on, it's okay.

20
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:32,181
Austin:
Where's Alex?

21
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,119
Alex, you're up!

22
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:37,315
Go, go, go, go!

23
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:38,460
Knock 'em out.

24
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:18,832
Are you okay?

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,609
Aah!

26
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,374
Alex!

27
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:47,810

"Desire" by Ryan Adams

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,386
<i># Two hearts fading
like a flower #</i>

31
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:36,142
<i># And all this waiting
for the power #</i>

32
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:42,110
<i># For some answer
to this fire #</i>

33
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:45,173
<i># Sinking slowly #</i>

34
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:51,595
<i># The water's higher #
# Mmm, desire #</i>

35
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:58,191
<i># Desire #</i>

36
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:04,595
<i># With no secrets #</i>

37
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,429
<i># No obsession #</i>

38
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:13,227
<i># This time I'm speeding
with no direction #</i>

39
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,561
<i># Without a reason #</i>

40
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:19,898
<i># What is this fire #</i>

41
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:22,327
<i># Burning slowly #</i>

00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:28,922

Wilson:
How'd you get here?

45
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,662
By osmosis.

46
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,086
No helmet?

47
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:42,049
Didn't seem like riding weather.

48
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:45,027
And the fact that you can
barely stand upright had
nothing to do with it?

49
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:47,883
- Infarctions hurt.
That's what they do.

50
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:46,984
- House!

51
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:51,119
Worsening pain could
actually be a good thing.

52
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:53,012
Means the nerves
might be regenerating.

53
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:54,439
Could be good,
could be bad.

54
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,204
Thanks for the differential.
Any other options?

55
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:00,393
Have you ever
considered a career
as a motivational speaker?

56
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:03,655
- Why don't you
check out some rehab?
- I did the rehab thing.

57
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,740
One session.
And you didn't even
finish that session.

58
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:08,012
The guy wanted me
to visualize the healing.

59
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,333
I can do that home.

60
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,104
At least let me
get you an MRI.

61
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:14,251
It's a very simple equation.
More pain, more pills.

62
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:16,091
Teenage supermodel.

63
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:21,264
Presented with double vision,
sudden aggressive behavior,
cataplexy--

64
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:23,321
You had me
at teenage supermodel.

65
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,103
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:37,437
Wow. You should be a model.

67
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:39,371
Are you really 15?

68
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:40,210
Who are you?

69
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:42,637
I'll be the one
saving her life today.

70
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:45,028
Assuming she's dying.
Who are you?

71
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:46,596
He's my father.

72
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:48,363
Any idea
what's wrong with her?

73
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:51,370
Well, from the looks of it,
not a single thing.

74
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:56,285
Probably should stop staring
and check out the file.

75
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:57,929
So, what set off the brawl?

76
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,480
She stand in your light?

77
00:05:59,715 --> 00:06:01,139
I didn't even know her.

78
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,675
I didn't know
what happened.

79
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,521
Look, I know some models
are notorious for hissy fits.

80
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,626
But Alex, I've never
even seen her get angry.

81
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:08,753
Even when she was a kid
she was--

82
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:10,577
I'm sure she was
delightful in her youth.

83
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,797
And then you passed out.

84
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:14,661
I was passed out,
but I wasn't.

85
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:17,965
I knew what was going on,
but I couldn't move or talk.

86
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:19,826
Yeah, that sounds
like a medical thing.

87
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,595
It's called cataplexy.

88
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:25,965
Cat fight and cataplexy
on the catwalk. Cool.

89
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:27,634
How much
were you drinking?

90
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,114
She only had
one sip of champagne.

91
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:33,511
Forget it. We'll find out
from the tox screen.

92
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:36,180
All right, look.
I gave her a valium.

93
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:37,435
Do you think
that's what did this?

94
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,329
No.  How long have
you had the sweats?

95
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:43,696
- A couple of days.
- Any other complaints?

96
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,615
Uh, my stomach's
been bothering me.

97
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,500
And I've been feeling
a little nauseous.

98
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,226
Okay.
Here's how this works.

99
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:55,084
My lackeys will be by shortly to
draw some blood, collect some urine,
any other fluids you got.

100
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,034
They'll do some other
doctorly stuff.

101
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,388
And we'll be in touch.

102
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,912
Since when do you
voluntarily go see patients?

103
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,768
-  Have you seen her?
- She's 15.

104
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:12,500
Yeah, but there's
something about her.

105
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,554
Something in her eyes.
A kind of maturity.

106
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:17,702
Yeah, yeah. She's an old soul.
This is creepy even for you.

107
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:20,466
She's a fashion model
on the cover of magazines.

108
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,558
They hold her up
as the sexual ideal,

109
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,940
but the law says we can't
touch her for three more years.
How hypocritical is that?

110
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:29,953
Did the history reveal anything,
oh, I don't know, medically relevant?

111
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:31,598
History, right.

112
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:33,070
I knew I was forgetting something.

113
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:36,078
You should do one of those
while you're running the labs
and the tox screen.

114
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,864
Labs show valium
and heroin in her urine.

115
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,892
A supermodel on smack.
Shocker.

116
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:51,328
Oh,  Alex. I expected
so much more from you.

117
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,996
Heroin chic is
so five years ago.

118
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:57,519
Okay.
Let's start crossing out
withdrawal symptoms.

119
00:07:57,604 --> 00:07:59,534
A positive test means
she tried it once.

120
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,602
Doesn't mean she's an addict.
She's only 15.

121
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:03,217
There's no age limit
on addiction.

122
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:03,763
He's right.

123
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,561
She's never menstruated.
Sounds like a symptom
of drug addiction to me.

124
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,680
Or bulimia. Or her age.

125
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:10,762
Some girls don't start
till their mid to late teens.

126
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:14,147
Evidence to the contrary.
The rounded hips.

127
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,289
The perfectly sculpted,
bountiful breasts.

128
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,992
Chase:
Implants.

129
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:21,030
I've seen some of her photos.

130
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:22,944
They've grown dramatically
since last summer.

131
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,241
Symptomatic of turning 14.

132
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:29,566
Two clinic hours says
that those love apples are
handcrafted by God.

133
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,185
Whoa! I thought
you didn't believe in God.

134
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:33,369
I do now.

135
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,333
You're on.

136
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,562
Could we talk about her health
instead of her breasts?

137
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,054
It could be relevant.

138
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,492
Come on, Cameron.
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

139
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,344
Many women develop breasts--

140
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,544
No, I'm fine.

141
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:56,111
Even if she is an addict,
a lot of her symptoms--
the cataplexy, the violence--

142
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:57,574
they could be neurological.

143
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:01,003
We chalk this up to drugs,
we could be releasing her
with Juvenile MS or Parkinson's or--

144
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:02,362
So detox her.

145
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:05,773
Fine. We'll set her up on a program.
They'll wean her onto the methadone--

146
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,742
And in four weeks
we'll know you're right.

147
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,724
Or we'll know that Cameron's right,
and the pretty girl will do Milan
next Fall in a wheelchair.

148
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:17,952
Put her in a coma and
pump her full of naltrexone.
Cut the four weeks to one night.

149
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:24,119
The lab reports show that
your daughter had heroin
in her system.

150
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,665
Were you aware
of her drug use?

151
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:28,476
No.

152
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,776
We think she's suffering
from withdrawal symptoms.

153
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:34,388
Detoxing generally
takes several weeks.

154
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:37,593
The danger is that
if the drugs are masking
some of other illness,

155
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:40,670
it could worsen
before we've weaned her off
of the heroin.

156
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:41,768
Well, how much worse?

157
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,977
We don't know because
we don't know what's wrong.

158
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:47,373
There is a rapid
detox procedure.

159
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,399
We flush her system
with an opioid antagonist.

160
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,613
It'll end her addiction overnight.

161
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,147
But the process is dangerous
because we have to induce a coma.

162
00:09:57,812 --> 00:10:03,967
It also means that if she ever relapses,
there's a good chance she'll overdose
because her body won't react to the drug.

163
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,889
So either way I'm--

164
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:08,538
I'm risking her life.

165
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:15,952
Do you have to tell her
how dangerous it is?

166
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,615
Is it dangerous?

167
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:26,603
There are certain risks.

168
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,884
We've gone over them
with your father.

169
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,988
And he's not worried?

170
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,649
He's your dad.

171
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:36,246
He's always gonna worry.

172
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,967
But he knows we're gonna
take good care of you.

173
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:42,316
Oh. Everything's starting to hurt.
My legs.

174
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:45,129
Heroin withdrawal is
an extremely painful process.

175
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,194
But we're gonna put you to sleep.
You won't feel a thing.

176
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:51,711
Promise?

177
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,080
I promise.

178
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:56,698
It was a pretty
stupid thing to do, huh?

179
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,304
Getting hooked on drugs?

180
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,564
Yeah, not the best move
you've ever made.

181
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:03,217
Alex:
I just--I thought
it would be fun.

182
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,993
Chase:
You don't have to
explain to us.

183
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:08,408
A lot of the other girls were--

184
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,475
When you wake up,
you'll feel a lot better.

185
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:36,222
[Monitor starts beeping]

186
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,942
Nurse. Nurse!

187
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,323
You son of a bitch!
You killed her.

188
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:11,479
- She's not dead.
- She had a heart attack.

189
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,095
She's stable now.
The anesthesia--

190
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,400
Get her out of that coma.

191
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:15,881
Don't think so.

192
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,191
Stop this. All right,
I-I don't consent anymore.

193
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,905
I want to do the slow detox.

194
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:27,509
Did you ever get a paper cut?

195
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:30,155
A really nasty one
between the fingers?

196
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,667
Multiply that by about a billion

197
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:37,052
and it'll just barely approach
the kind of suffering she'll experience
if we wake her right now.

198
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:39,677
We're committed to this.

199
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:45,633
She's out till morning.
Go get a book.

200
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:56,560
I haven't slept in weeks.

201
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:58,634
Because my teeth hurt.

202
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:01,589
Dentist couldn't find any cavities.

203
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,200
And I'm getting these headaches.

204
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:06,268
Oh, poor you.

205
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,193
I think I'm going crazy.

206
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:15,210
And my stomach.
I roll out of bed,
and I want to puke.

207
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:17,319
I take it your married.

208
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:20,213
You must be psychic.

209
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:21,738
You must be witty.

210
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:23,471
When's she due?

211
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:26,117
- How'd you know she was--
- Because I'm doing her.

212
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:29,300
You've got Couvade Syndrome.

213
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:32,366
Which is just
a fancy way of saying
you should stop whining.

214
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:35,448
Millions of women
have got the same thing.
They're not bugging me.

215
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:37,881
You're suffering from
sympathetic pregnancy.

216
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:43,346
Gotta go. People dying.
The whole circle of life thing.

217
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,574
- It's all in my head?
- Nope. It's all in your hormones.

218
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,125
Good news is
no one's gonna lecture you
if you smoke and get drunk.

219
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:58,325
Shouldn't she be awake by now?

220
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:01,101
It's only been a half an hour
since we stopped the medicine.

221
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:02,756
Well, you said that's
how long it would take.

222
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:05,085
I said it would take
about half an hour.

223
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:06,303
Well, couldn't this
mean something--

224
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:08,200
So far, it means nothing.

225
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:11,153
She had a heart attack.
She could have brain damage.
She could have something--

226
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:12,765
She's opening her eyes.

227
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:16,956
Alex? You okay?

228
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:19,004
Can you hear me?

229
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:22,186
Hmm.

230
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:26,290
I got the cute doctor.

231
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:30,036
Huh. Do you feel any pain?

232
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,141
Good. Let us know
if anything changes.

233
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,946
If your stomach
doesn't feel right, anything.

234
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:38,237
Hey.

235
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,447
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

236
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:46,037
I let you down.

237
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:48,624
No, no. Not at all, sweetie. I--

238
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:51,396
I should've been more mature.
I should've handled the pressure.

239
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,976
Stop, stop.

240
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:55,754
We're gonna get you better, all right?

241
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,656
Nothing else matters.

242
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,051
Excuse me.

243
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:06,198
We've got you on
what we call a banana bag.

244
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:08,391
Plenty of vitamins, nutrients.

245
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:10,416
I got the cute doctor.

246
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:17,448
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

247
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:20,168
I let you down.

248
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:21,779
What's going on?

249
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:25,269
I should've been  more mature.
I should've handled the pressure.

250
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:26,907
What's wrong with her?

251
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:31,877
Anterograde amnesia,
short-term memory loss.

252
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:34,273
Evidence of a hypoxic brain injury.

253
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:38,225
Might be a result of getting cut off
from the oxygen when she flatlined.

254
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,774
Probably the result
of that rapid detox
you told us to push on her.

255
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:45,001
You gonna put that down?

256
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:53,087
You gonna sulk?

257
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,198
I'm not gonna indulge you.

258
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:58,704
Treatment of hypoxic
brain injuries consist of--

259
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:03,235
[Exhales]
Cameron, Chase,
and the dark one.

260
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,706
Foreman, right?

261
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,850
Patient flatlined
for, like, 30 seconds.

262
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:10,958
Gotta be oxygen deprived
for longer than that
to lose brain function.

263
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,961
- We can't be sure
how long she was--
- Her brain's fine.

264
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:14,974
Memory loss.

265
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,822
You're saying that's
not a neurological symptom?

266
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:19,669
No, I'm saying
what I'm saying.
Her brain's fine.

267
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,887
She's faking?

268
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:24,440
She's got post traumatic
stress disorder.

269
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:26,741
We got models
fighting in Iraq now?

270
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:29,019
Show me a woman on heroin
who looks like that,

271
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,320
and I'll show you a woman
who's been sexually abused.

272
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:34,211
That's your proof?
That she's good-looking?

273
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:35,930
He manages her career.

274
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:39,103
Travels  the world with her.
At her side 24/7.

275
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:42,764
He's either a very good dad
or a very bad dad.

276
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:44,618
House:
You saw that touckhus.

277
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,321
Would the fact that
she's your daughter
really stop you?

278
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:48,439
Oh.

279
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:50,985
Her brain is running
away from reality.

280
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:54,046
When the drugs
can't do it anymore,
it starts to shut down.

281
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:59,990
Your theory has the advantages of
being completely unprovable
and completely exculpating you.

282
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:03,463
When you guys are done talking,
do an MRI and an LP.

283
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:08,085
When her brain checks out
as normal, then we'll know that
Daddy really, really loves her.

284
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:14,589
Where's House?

285
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:16,879
Said he was
in too much pain to work.

286
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:17,641
Who's covering?

287
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:21,493
He called 15 minutes
after his shift started.
It's too late to find anybody.

288
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:23,781
- Exam room one.
- Ugh.

289
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,237
- Hi.
- Where's Dr. House?

290
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,736
Wish I knew. Huh.

291
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:34,284
What's the problem?

292
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,467
It's personal.

293
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,146
And it's so personal
he didn't bother writing
anything in your chart.

294
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:42,256
It's getting worse.

295
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,383
What is?

296
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:45,285
It's personal.

297
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:49,549
-  Fine. You can wait.
- Doctor.

298
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,379
I tell you what.

299
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:05,384
I am gonna give you
Dr. House's personal pager number.

300
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,684
Why would your mind
go to abuse so fast?

301
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,697
'Cause I had a funny uncle.

302
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:15,811
You were abused?

303
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:19,240
What? No.
Why would your mind
go to that so fast?

304
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:22,521
I just had a funny uncle.
Great stories, always filthy.

305
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:25,029
I don't know
if it's something
with this case,

306
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:28,072
or you got something
personal going on.
The whole break-up thing.

307
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:29,651
- It's personal.
- House.

308
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:32,750
Your pain is affecting
your decision-making.

309
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:36,550
You got a problem
with a call I make,
question the call.

310
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,018
Don't make it personal.

311
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:40,746
Are you saying pain
can't affect your mood?

312
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,122
If I'm right about the pain,

313
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,496
you're gonna want
to rush everything.
Which is what you're doing.

314
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:48,241
Don't.

315
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:53,689
Thank you.

316
00:18:59,363 --> 00:19:01,118
Are you doing your daughter?

317
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,247
What?

318
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,548
We should probably
talk privately, huh?

319
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:10,078
Come on, walk with me.

320
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:16,323
- I'm not--
- He's not.

321
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:17,850
I'm sure he's not.

322
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:19,875
She is a babe, though.

323
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,867
We're gonna need you
to keep still.

324
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,180
I am.

325
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,331
What do you think that means?

326
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:46,272
It's  either neurological
or psychological.

327
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:49,169
The only thing we know for sure is
it's gonna screw up the MRI results,

328
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,243
which is gonna make
House think he's right.

329
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:54,184
This is a waste of time.
Let's just get the LP.

330
00:19:57,854 --> 00:19:59,585
I should take your head off.

331
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:05,174
Your glands are fine.
See, now you're my patient.

332
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:08,480
You got doctor-patient
confidentiality. No worries.

333
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:10,641
So, what did you do to her?

334
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:14,005
- Why would you possibly think--
- Hard to imagine anyone
not wanting to nail her.

335
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,410
- You son of a--
- It's a compliment.

336
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:20,794
A heart-shaped ass.
Those perfect, perky
all-natural breasts.

337
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:22,789
That is my daughter
you're talking about!

338
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:25,585
No, that's your daughter
you were talking about.

339
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:28,840
"She just instinctively
knows how to walk."

340
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:32,525
"Designers just love
that heart-shaped ass,
those perfect, perky--"

341
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,650
I'm her manager.
I have to promote her.

342
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,653
Oh, that makes sense.
So you compartmentalize.

343
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:40,747
When you're dealing
with the press,
you're her manager.

344
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:43,540
When you're helping
with homework,
you're her dad.

345
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,070
When you're making
sweet, sweet love,

346
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:48,063
- you're her manager.
- All right.

347
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,184
Do you love her?

348
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,500
- I have never touched her.
- Do you love her?

349
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:53,357
What are you doing?
You trying to trap me
into saying--

350
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,168
Do you love her enough
to admit that you slept with her?

351
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:04,299
Psychology conditions
can manifest themselves
in physical problems.

352
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,757
Sometimes, these can be
extreme enough to kill.

353
00:21:07,113 --> 00:21:09,961
There are treatments, but
only if there's a diagnosis.

354
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:16,212
Are you gonna admit that
you slept with your daughter or
are you just gonna let her die?

355
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:25,874
One time.

356
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:42,362
PTSD.

357
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:46,674
Get her a psych referral and
pack her bags. He did her.

358
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:47,963
Don't think so.

359
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,352
Daddy thinks so.

360
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:52,285
Could be mistaken.
He said he was drunk.

361
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,967
Maybe it was
some other daughter.

362
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:56,697
Elevated proteins in her CSF.

363
00:21:57,904 --> 00:22:02,299
You're wrong about PTSD,
and I was wrong about
the hypoxic brain injury.

364
00:22:02,903 --> 00:22:06,256
Daddy didn't do this to her.
And neither did we.

365
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:18,984
We have to call
Child Protective Services.

366
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:20,988
Doctor-patient confidentiality--

367
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:22,955
Doesn't apply
in abuse cases.
You know that.

368
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,173
Cameron:
We're mandated
to report sexual abuse.

369
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,469
Is it okay
if I save her life first?

370
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:31,140
Or do you want to make sure
that Daddy doesn't get
visitation rights to the gravesite?

371
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:34,995
Okay, elevated proteins
in her CSF could mean
dozens of different things.

372
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,112
Viral encephalitis.
CNSV.

373
00:22:37,177 --> 00:22:38,441
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

374
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,302
So we're just gonna
leave a child molester
in the same room as his victim?

375
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:42,775
It's got windows.

376
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:49,045
Fine. Arrest him.
Use Cuddy's handcuffs.

377
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:51,568
If you're too distracted
to deal with this because
your leg hurts, then--

378
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,163
Yeah, I'm distracted!

379
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:56,184
I'm all hung up on
this 15-year-old patient
who's cataplectic,

380
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:59,606
can't remember what she had
for lunch, and is rapidly
losing control of her body.

381
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:03,411
And I want her father here
in case they got any more secrets
that I need to know about.

382
00:23:03,553 --> 00:23:07,840
Now, if you're not too distracted,
go take out a piece of her brain.
Stick it under  a microscope.

383
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:10,196
Wilson!

384
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:14,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You really think we need to
jump straight to brain biopsy?

385
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:19,049
Nope. Let's continue
playing pin the diagnosis on
the supermodel until she's dead.

386
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:24,886
Heard you killed
your supermodel.

387
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,265
Only for a minute.

388
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,742
Just for my own clarity,
how many more patients
do you have to kill

389
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,693
before you admit this leg thing
just might be a problem?

390
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:34,059
Three.

391
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:38,083
I need your help.

392
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:45,598
We're gonna do something
called a burr hole biopsy.

393
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,174
We drill a small opening
in the back of your skull.

394
00:23:49,324 --> 00:23:52,144
Doctor, maybe you and I
should talk about this first.

395
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,172
No.

396
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:57,192
I just think Alex doesn't need
to be overwhelmed right now.

397
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:00,455
I think she should have a say
in what happens to her body.

398
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:11,989
We're gonna remove
a small piece of brain tissue.

399
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:14,982
Do--do you have to
shave my hair?

400
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,202
Hair grows back.

401
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:19,495
I guess I won't
remember anyways.

402
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,142
There's a good chance
the amnesia's only temporary.

403
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,310
Okay.

404
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:03,995
Find a way to
kick up the contribution.

405
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:08,487
What did House do now?

406
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,937
House, this is God.

407
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:21,854
Look, I'm a little
busy right now.

408
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:24,384
Not supposed to talk
during these things.

409
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:26,238
You got time Thursday?

410
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:30,635
Let me check.
Oh, I've got a plague.
How about Friday?

411
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:33,400
You'll have to
check with Cameron.

412
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,023
Oh, damn it.

413
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,833
She always wants to know
why bad things happen.

414
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:40,685
Like I'm gonna come up
with a new answer this time.

415
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:42,917
House.

416
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,193
Quick, God.
Smite the evil witch!

417
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:49,159
Are you sitting on evidence
that your patient was
sexually abused by her father?

418
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,324
God, why have you forsaken me?

419
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:54,838
Cuddy:
Don't worry. I've contacted
Child Services for you.

420
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:58,382
I left you get away
with more than anyone
in this hospital.

421
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:01,387
Shielding a child abuser
isn't covered.

422
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:05,434
Cooperate with
this investigation,
or I'll fire you.

423
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:10,711
Chase:
What do you think
House is gonna do to you?

424
00:26:11,024 --> 00:26:12,204
No idea.

425
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:14,157
Well, you did the right thing.

426
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,675
If you hadn't gone to Cuddy,
I would've.

427
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:20,469
If this guy had known
we had to report him,
he'd never have told House the truth.

428
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:23,548
She's a child.
She needs to be protected.

429
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:26,543
She dropped out of high school
to make millions of dollars.

430
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:30,748
Why does she need more protection
than some crack whore shivering
in the clinic waiting room?

431
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,886
I think you're just
afraid to piss House off.

432
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,812
There's that too.

433
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:39,563
MRI looks exactly the same
as it did two years ago.

434
00:26:39,688 --> 00:26:41,780
Nerves don't seem to be regenerating.

435
00:26:42,283 --> 00:26:43,364
I figured as much.

436
00:26:43,557 --> 00:26:47,997
Several different researchers
have proven psychological pain
can manifest as physical pain.

437
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:50,554
You think I have
a conversion disorder?
You want me to see a shrink?

438
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:52,270
Brilliant idea
sending Stacy away.

439
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,638
It's really done
wonders for you.

440
00:26:53,722 --> 00:26:56,022
Listen, none of this has
anything to do with Stacy.

441
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:59,617
Right. Giant coincidence
that you've gone completely
off the rails since she left.

442
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,134
Inducing migraines,
worsening leg pain--

443
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,542
Ow!

444
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:06,287
Aw. You miss Stacy too?

445
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,327
Brain biopsy shows
no white matter disease.

446
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:23,936
Cameron, you gonna
go tell Cuddy?

447
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,695
Or has she already
got you wired for sound?

448
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,341
I had to do
what I thought was right.

449
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:33,735
So white is out.
That just leaves gray.

450
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:38,150
Foreman:
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.
Heller Syndrome.

451
00:27:38,234 --> 00:27:40,735
Any one of
the mitochondrial
encephalopathies.

452
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:41,868
Am I in trouble?

453
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:44,193
You had to do
what you thought was right.

454
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:47,987
They call it gray area
'cause you never really
know what's there.

455
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:50,006
We can't test
for any of those things.

456
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,447
So I'm not in trouble?

457
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,985
You can torture
yourself all you want.

458
00:27:57,234 --> 00:28:01,400
What if everything we're seeing
is just smoke signals?

459
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:03,667
Okay.
Who's sending them?

460
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:05,443
Tumor.

461
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:11,223
If has cancer anywhere
in her body, she could also
have paraneoplastic syndrome,

462
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:14,111
which would be causing
antibodies to attack her brain.

463
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,696
Antibodies are
stupid that way.

464
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,910
Paraneoplastic syndrome's
awfully rare in a 15-year-old.

465
00:28:18,994 --> 00:28:21,216
15-year-olds who look
like that are awfully rare.

466
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,000
It would explain
the aggressive behavior, the cataplexy,
the memory loss, even the twitching.

467
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:26,896
It's perfect.

468
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:28,196
What if it's not?

469
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,519
We could waste weeks
searching for a tumor that
we don't even know is there.

470
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:33,285
Then let's make sure
it is there.

471
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:35,648
There's no test
for paraneoplastic syndrome.

472
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:39,147
Sure there is.
The squeeze the tube test.

473
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,668
What did the biopsy tell you?

474
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,389
It wasn't definitive.

475
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:47,604
But the twitching
should stop right about...

476
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:49,325
Now.

477
00:28:52,955 --> 00:28:54,056
Oh, my God.

478
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,286
House:
Could've just
been a coincidence.

479
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:59,863
Twitching does
tend to stop and start.
Let's be sure.

480
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:09,428
IVIG vacuums her blood.
Neutralizes the stuff
that's making her twitch.

481
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:13,052
It's actually kind of cool.

482
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,547
Wonder if I could
make you dance.

483
00:29:19,614 --> 00:29:20,068
Enough.

484
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:22,787
This is unbelievable.
You did it. You fixed her.

485
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:27,479
No. All I did was
prove that she has cancer.

486
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:36,086
I need a favor.

487
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,013
I'm not in a giving mood.

488
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,598
It'll help us both.

489
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:46,483
I need a shot
of morphine in my spine.

490
00:29:47,331 --> 00:29:49,633
If your leg hurts,
take your Vicodin.

491
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:51,322
It's not enough.

492
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:54,026
Get a syringe.

493
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:56,273
Morphine is extreme,
even for you.

494
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:59,032
Yeah, read that
on the insert.

495
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:01,110
Get one of your lackeys to do it.

496
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:02,435
I don't want them knowing.

497
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,203
That you're on the road
to becoming a junkie?

498
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:05,758
That I'm in this much pain.

499
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:08,377
I don't want them
questioning my judgment.

500
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:11,470
I can't ask Wilson because
he figures it's all in my head.

501
00:30:11,554 --> 00:30:13,332
Well, I agree with him.

502
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:14,913
I'm going home.

503
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:19,301
Well, what about this?

504
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,079
What are you doing?

505
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,959
Is this in my head?

506
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:30,400
'Cause I could swear I remember
a thigh muscle being here.

507
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:35,773
I'll get a syringe.

508
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:33,840
- It's gotta be cancer.
- It's not cancer.

509
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:37,667
You seem to be back
to your old miserable self.

510
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:42,463
So I just randomly predicted
she'd respond to IVIG?

511
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:44,746
Her twitches are gone.
Her memory's getting better.

512
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:45,934
What did you take?

513
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,680
If the increased pain
was psychological,
no drug's gonna help.

514
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,961
If you think it'll help,
the drugs will help.

515
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:53,971
- Power of the mind.
- You're right.

516
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:56,772
The more I talk to you,
the more the pain floods back.

517
00:31:57,635 --> 00:32:01,041
Knew the twins were real.
Chase owes me.

518
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:03,811
- You check the pancreas?
- Oh, come on!

519
00:32:03,895 --> 00:32:06,014
You're just making up
organs now, aren't you?

520
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:08,097
We checked the pancreas.

521
00:32:09,002 --> 00:32:11,800
- Obviously you've taken something.
- You check the bones?

522
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:13,507
There are a lot of bones, I think.

523
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:15,216
And none of them have cancer.

524
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:16,598
Ovaries?

525
00:32:16,682 --> 00:32:18,694
There's no mass.
If anything, they're undersized.

526
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:21,073
No leukemia, no Hodgkin's.
We checked everything.

527
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:24,009
Unless they've invented
a new organ, it's not cancer.

528
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:33,380
Differential diagnosis.

529
00:32:33,604 --> 00:32:36,593
It's gotta be cancer.
There's gotta be
something we missed.

530
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:38,291
You gotta learn
to let go, Foreman.

531
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,560
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.
It might still  just be PTSD.

532
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:46,906
Just PTSD?
Yeah, Daddy's diddling her.
Nothing to worry about.

533
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,490
Chase:
Okay, let me rephrase.

534
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,225
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.

535
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:53,810
Oh, my God!
It might be PTSD!

536
00:32:53,894 --> 00:32:58,775
If it was PTSD, the twitching
wouldn't have magically disappeared
when we started the IVIG.

537
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,561
Mmm, wrong.

538
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:03,823
What it wouldn't have done
was medically disappear.

539
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,237
Nothing to stop it from
magically disappearing.

540
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,819
She was watching me
stop and start the medicine.

541
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:11,205
You think she's faking?

542
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,688
Not consciously.

543
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:18,530
But if her subconscious is
trying to get away from it all,
cancer's gotta be a lovely vacation spot.

544
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:22,112
Tell her you've gotta
give her a fresh IV.

545
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,098
Don't tell her you're
starting her on saline.

546
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:26,222
We'll see if
the twitching comes back.

547
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:34,032
How long has
the social worker been in there?

548
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:35,212
Just went in.

549
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:37,080
She was in
with the dad before.

550
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:38,576
You switch the girl's IV?

551
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,128
About half an hour ago.

552
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:41,952
When is she gonna
start twitching?

553
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:45,768
If she's gonna start twitching,
another few minutes.

554
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:48,994
We've gotta wait
for the remaining IVIG
to clear her system.

555
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:52,604
That was quick.
What's gonna happen?

556
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,627
What did you think
was gonna happen?

557
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:57,670
- The father had sex--
- Do you have any
medical evidence of that?

558
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,148
- He admitted--
- He denies that conversation
ever took place.

559
00:34:00,148 --> 00:34:02,079
- She--
- She denies it too.

560
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:03,858
I'm sure you meant well.

561
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:14,833
[Alex flipping through TV channels]

562
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,033
You have to tell her the truth.

563
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:18,300
Nothing happened.

564
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,827
You don't have to
be afraid of him.
They can protect you.

565
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,763
From what?
Things are fine.

566
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:28,195
You think things are fine.
They're not.

567
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:29,239
He's my dad.

568
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:30,738
He's abusing you.

569
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,443
He's not a bad person.

570
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:36,538
I seduced him.

571
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:40,570
You're the child.
He's the adult.

572
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,726
- He has the responsibility--
- I got him drunk.

573
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:46,408
I had to get him drunk.

574
00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:48,917
I wanted to
have sex with him.

575
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:52,027
You're sexually
attracted to your father?

576
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:53,163
No.

577
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:59,340
But by sleeping with him,
now he lets me do whatever I want.

578
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:06,479
I also slept with my photographer,
my financial manager, and my tutor.

579
00:35:07,544 --> 00:35:15,063
If I hadn't, I'd be getting Cs
and posing for newspaper ads
back in Detroit.

580
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,385
Hmm. Come on.
We all do it.

581
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:19,955
No, we don't.

582
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:23,752
After you father slept with you,
you were traumatized.

583
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:26,718
My dad was last.

584
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:34,166
You've never taken a run
at your boss or a professor
or somebody else you needed?

585
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:37,271
You're 15.

586
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:39,633
You're smart.
You don't have to--

587
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:42,538
I am not that smart.

588
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:46,086
I am that beautiful.

589
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,204
What's wrong with me?

590
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:06,392
Aw! George,
get your butt over here!

591
00:36:07,027 --> 00:36:08,035
George:
Help me!

592
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:09,297
How did you get
my pager number?

593
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,253
Please!

594
00:36:10,361 --> 00:36:13,765
Problem is
if I give you an epidural,

595
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,718
you won't be able
to feel when to push.

596
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:17,919
- You're not funny!
- Pretty sure I am.

597
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:20,022
You just can't appreciate it
because you're in pain.

598
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:23,134
George, if you don't
get off your ass and help me--

599
00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:25,387
Oh, shut up!

600
00:36:26,681 --> 00:36:29,642
Got yourself
the perfect man: a woman.

601
00:36:29,807 --> 00:36:32,413
He's got more estrogen
coursing through his veins than--

602
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:37,180
Oh! Aw! Ohhhhhh!

603
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:40,811
- Who did her vaginal exam?
- I did.

604
00:36:40,895 --> 00:36:42,133
Did she have hair?

605
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:43,416
What are you getting at?

606
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:46,183
Right now I'm getting at
whether or not she had hair
down there.

607
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:48,144
Uh, not much.

608
00:36:48,228 --> 00:36:51,108
She manipulative
yet completely docile.

609
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:54,404
Everybody tells us
that outburst on the catwalk
was out of character.

610
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:55,963
She's never had a period.

611
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:57,491
You're thinking
this is hormonal?

612
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:00,011
I'm thinking
she's the ultimate woman.

613
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,279
I-I need to schedule an MRI.

614
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:07,769
The twitching stopped.

615
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,028
Because we changed your medicine
back to the real stuff. Stop talking.

616
00:37:13,327 --> 00:37:15,557
You gave me fake medicine?

617
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:17,599
That's what I said.

618
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,408
In the vain hope that
you wouldn't feel
the need to also say it.

619
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:21,934
Stop talking.

620
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:25,979
Wilson already did an ultrasound.
Said her ovaries were undersized.

621
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:29,859
The ultrasound would be the way to go
if you were looking for ovarian cancer.

622
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,725
What are we looking for?

623
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:36,566
That.

624
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:40,464
Oh, my God.

625
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,826
Looks like a tumor, doesn't it?

626
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,234
But those are--

627
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,755
Yep.

628
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:04,307
We found a tumor.

629
00:38:05,622 --> 00:38:07,163
She has cancer?

630
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,885
Technically, no.

631
00:38:11,638 --> 00:38:12,959
So it's not cancer?

632
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:17,741
No, it's cancer.
But he has cancer.

633
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:22,573
On his left testicle.

634
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:26,093
I don't have testicles.

635
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,689
She's not a guy.

636
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:30,557
His DNA says you're wrong.

637
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:34,557
Frogs and snails
and puppy dog tails.

638
00:38:35,304 --> 00:38:38,830
You've got male
pseudohermaphroditism.

639
00:38:38,914 --> 00:38:41,065
See, we all start out as girls.

640
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:44,135
And then we're differentiated
based on our genes.

641
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:48,756
The ovaries develop
into testes and drop.

642
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:57,253
But in about 1 and 150,000 pregnancies
a fetus with an XY chromosome, a boy,
develops into something else.

643
00:38:57,547 --> 00:38:59,117
Like you.

644
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:01,825
Your testes never descended

645
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,315
because you're
immune to testosterone.

646
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:06,686
You're pure estrogen.

647
00:39:07,037 --> 00:39:10,291
Which is why you get
heightened female characteristics.

648
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:14,516
Clear skin. Great breasts.

649
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:19,595
The ultimate woman is a man.

650
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,133
Nature's cruel, huh?

651
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:27,364
This is obviously a joke.
This is--is impossible.

652
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:31,431
No, a joke would be
me calling you a homo.

653
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,246
See the difference?

654
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,139
I'll schedule him for surgery.

655
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:43,062
No. You're wrong.
I'm a girl.

656
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:46,660
Look at me!
How can you say
I'm not a girl?

657
00:39:46,744 --> 00:39:48,762
See? They're all
looking at me. I'm--

658
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:50,620
I'm beautiful!

659
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:56,745
That anger,
that's just the cancer talking.

660
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,782
Put your clothes back on.
I'm gonna cut your balls off.

661
00:40:03,077 --> 00:40:04,788
Then you'll be fine.

662
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,013
How's the patient?

663
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:41,552
Post-op.

664
00:40:42,308 --> 00:40:46,027
I set him/her up
for a psych visit.

665
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:49,220
Calling her "him/her"
isn't really helping.

666
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:53,324
Good news is I don't think
Dad's gonna be sleeping
with him/her again.

667
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:55,143
See, now it's gross.

668
00:41:00,053 --> 00:41:01,893
I need another shot.

669
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,805
When did the pain
start coming back?

670
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:06,389
A few hours ago.

671
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:09,073
About an hour after
you solved the case?

672
00:41:10,673 --> 00:41:14,125
If I wanted to be psychoanalyzed,
I'd get Wilson to give me the shot.

673
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:16,193
Same dosage?

674
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:22,264
If you'd be comfortable,
I might be able to deal with
a few less cc's of morphine.

675
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:24,348
It wasn't morphine.

676
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:27,900
