That's not it at all.

<i>I'm not thrilled</i>

181
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:21,376
might be the smartest person
on the team now.

182
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:22,644
I can only imagine
how you feel.

183
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:25,047
You're not smarter than me.

184
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:26,014
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

185
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:28,483
You find this?

186
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:30,786
(Foreman)
A jug of unpasteurized cider.

187
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:32,254
It could be tainted
with e coli,

188
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:34,056
and that's what's causing
the liver to shut down.

189
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:35,857
E coli is found in animals.

190
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:38,260
So unless he's drinking
pork cider...

191
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:40,262
Pork cider!

192
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,563
I need the number
of the patent office.

193
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,632
There are indirect ways
of attracting e coli.

194
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,001
Masters refused
to go on the search with us.

195
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:47,235
Interesting.

196
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,670
Which raises the question,

197
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:50,205
what <i>is</i> your problem
with her?

198
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:52,474
He is intimidated
by her intelligence.

199
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:53,408
<i>(House)</i>
<i>Why would that bother Taub?</i>

200
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:54,743
<i>He's been working</i>

201
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:56,244
with people smarter than him
for a long time.

202
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:57,746
I think perky new girl

203
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:59,748
makes him feel old.

204
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,616
She's basically the same age
as thirteen.

205
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:03,218
Yeah, but she's a student.

206
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:05,187
Makes you contemplate
your med school days.

207
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:06,888
Back when you had hair,
muscle tone,

208
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:08,824
and no need
for a regular prostate exam.

209
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:09,958
Makes sense.

210
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:11,793
Just like e coli.

211
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,328
Orchards make cider
out of apples

212
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:14,563
they can't sell otherwise,

213
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,931
like if they've fallen
onto the ground.

214
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:18,367
Like, to some cow feces.

215
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:21,002
Which would mean
our esteemed patient

216
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,939
is literally
full of b.S.

217
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:25,273
Cool.

218
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:27,175
Go get the ingenue,

219
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:29,811
start the patient on aztreonam
and plasmapheresis.

220
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,750
[Loudly] He said to start
the patient on aztre...

221
00:08:34,817 --> 00:08:37,152
[chuckling]

222
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,854
The cell sorter
separates the plasma

223
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,322
from the remaining
cellular components,

224
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,423
thereby removing...

225
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:44,192
the toxins,
antibodies, cryoglobulins.

226
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,394
I think we should
tell our patient

227
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:46,661
about breaking into his house.

228
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,063
Why would we do that?

229
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:49,631
Because the reason
not to tell him

230
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,533
was that he might
hide something.

231
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:53,168
And now that rationale is moot.

232
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:54,503
The rationale now

233
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,772
is no upside, big downside.

234
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,174
How can we ask our patients
to trust us

235
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:00,542
if we're not honest with them?

236
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,210
How can we ask the patient
to trust us

237
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:03,712
after we tell him
he <i>can't</i> trust us?

238
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:06,515
Fine.

239
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:07,516
Tell him.

240
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,050
Clear your conscience,

241
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,919

what's important.

for programs which, oh, by the
way, Moreno wants to cut.

250

All right. I'll draft it up,
send it over.

You should probably slow down

253

until you're
out of the hospital.

254
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,149
It's a busy week.

255
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:49,524
Aren't you curious how we
came up with this diagnosis?

256
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:51,993
You're doctors.
Isn't that your job?

257
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:53,528
But how we knew
you were drinking apple cider?

258
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:55,297
Well, you had to have
found that at my house,

259
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:56,898
so I guess you guys
broke in there.

260

That doesn't bother you?

261
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:03,738
Medicine's like politics.

262
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,440
At the end of the day,
all that matters is results.

263
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:06,441
That's not true.

Real cause.

357
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:20,923
Cause that a human being
would consider cause.

358
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,524
Never mind, then.

359
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:24,326
She's got principals.

360
00:13:24,394 --> 00:13:27,896
She's like the love child
of Einstein and Mary Poppins.

361
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:29,998
Didn't even get
Einstein's hair.

362
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:32,134
It's worth having
someone on the team

363
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:34,603
who doesn't see the world
entirely as shades of gray.

364
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:36,371
It <i>is</i> gray!
To you.

365
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:39,441
[Elevator dings]
She has a fresh perspective.

366
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:41,143
Unless that threatens you.

367
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:43,712
It does not...

368
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,647
<i>You thought</i>
<i>I'd get defensive,</i>

369
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:47,616
keep her out of pride.

370
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:50,452
A girl can hope.

371
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,056
House, I gave this
a lot of thought.

372
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,225
<i>She deserves</i>
<i>a chance.</i>

373
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,392
A real chance.

374
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,602
House is gonna fire me.

375
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:08,470
No, he isn't.

376
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:10,105
Because you told him not to?

377
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,975
Butting heads with House
is par for the course.

378
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,843
House has strong beliefs,

379
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:17,546
and he respects other people
with strong beliefs.

380
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:20,249
It's not my beliefs
that are the problem.

381
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:21,416
It's my personality.

382
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:24,086
I'm not good at working
with other people.

383
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,555
You've been in there
for less than a day.

384
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:28,056
I wasn't looking
for encouragement.

385
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,726
It's a fact.

386
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:32,628
Growing up,
my whole life, really,

387
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:34,730
I-I spent
a lot of time by myself.

388
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:36,532
And no one in high school
wants to hang out

389
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:39,301
with a kid that's
three years younger than them.

390
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:42,004
And studying Anosov
diffeomorphisms,

391
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:44,273
determining whether
an unattributed landscape

392
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,743
is a blakelock or a ryder or...

393
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,912
I'm actually
boring you right now.

394
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:52,548
And yet you chose medicine

395
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:55,117
which is a team activity.

396
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,351
It's pretty gutsy,

397
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:58,086
stepping so far outside
your comfort zone.

398
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:02,524
I'm not trying
to prove anything.

399
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:04,893
I just wanted to be a doctor.

400
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:06,929
It was stupid.

401
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:10,465
Nobody can do everything.

402
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:15,971
I was vain to think
I could be the exception.

403
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,806
House doesn't care
if you're a team player,

404
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:19,708
or how ethical you are,

405
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,543
or how high your I.Q. Is.

406
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:24,146
It's all about the cases.

407
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,615
You help him crack this one,

408
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:28,083
you two are gonna
get along just fine.

409
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,688
(Foreman) We gotta give
masters some pointers,

410
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:34,923
help her figure out
how to deal with House.

411
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,758
Why would I do that?

412
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:39,861
The entertainment factor
is off the charts.

413
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,130
It's like watching
a bunny hop into a buzz saw.

414
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:43,632
Repeatedly.

415
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,634
And if we don't help her,
she's out of here.

416
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:49,204
No, something else is stopping
House from firing her.

417
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:52,107
I'm guessing it's his desire
to keep having sex with Cuddy.

418
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:56,245
<i>(Dugan)</i> <i>You guys ready to
admit</i> <i>you were wrong yet?</i>

419
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:58,146
Excuse me?

420
00:15:58,214 --> 00:16:01,183
This tumor you're looking for...
you're not gonna find it.

421
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,687
My judgment
is completely sound.

422
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,322
So when you leaked that ad,

423
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,392
you were <i>trying</i> to torpedo
the senator's campaign?

424
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,327
All right, one,
I told you before,

425
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:13,428
I didn't leak that spot.

426
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:15,430
Uh-huh.

427
00:16:15,498 --> 00:16:16,398
<i>And two...</i>

428
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,200
Whoever did leak that ad

429
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,601
had nothing wrong
with their mind either.

430
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:20,902
It's gonna save Anderson.

431
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,404
<i>(Chase)</i>
<i>That commercial...</i>

432
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:24,906
Everyone sees through it.

433
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,441
You're just trying to play
to people's fears.

434
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:27,743
<i>You say fears.</i>

435
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,646
I say rational,
protective instincts.

436
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:32,981
And judging by your accent,

437
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:34,816
immigration probably
isn't an issue

438
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:36,785
you can be
real impartial about.

439
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:39,421
I waited five years
to get my green card.

440
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:40,822
If there's anyone
who would resent

441
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,624
someone trying to skip
the queue, it'd be me.

442
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:44,726
Just because Moreno
favors amnesty...

443
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,728
He doesn't.

444
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:48,563
You know that picture of him
with the Mexican flags

445
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:51,767
that seems to be
from a pro-amnesty rally?

446
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,802
That's from an amnesty
international speech

447
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,939
protesting the imprisonment
of priests in Oaxaca.

448
00:16:58,007 --> 00:17:00,175
<i>Yes, you did just prove</i>
<i>that that ad</i>

449
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:02,044
<i>is even more disgusting</i>
<i>than you thought.</i>

450
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:06,715
You also proved
that ad is effective.

451
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:08,784
You still think
my judgment is off?

452
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:10,952
Not anymore.

453
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,721
<i>There's no sign</i>
<i>of a tumor.</i>

454
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:14,623
That leaves d.I.C.

455
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,491
I'll go check how Taub is doing
with the blood work.

456
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:24,333
I guess when you
get on in years,

457
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,835
it takes a little longer to run
a few simple blood tests.

458
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:28,704
This whole "Taub's
an old man" thing

459
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:30,305
kinda rings hollow,

460
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,140
considering I'm in better shape
than you are.

461
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,442
Pass the dye.

462
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:35,711
You're in <i>rounder</i> shape
than me.

463
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:36,945
Tonight after work,

464
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:38,447
meet at the basketball courts
in the gym.

465
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:41,083
You do realize you're
two and a half feet tall, right?

466
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,218
And white.
And Jewish.

467
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:44,586
It'd be very embarrassing.

468
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:46,021
I get why you wanna say no.

469
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:47,756
Tonight after work.

470
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:49,825
[Beeping] Crap.

471
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:55,464
(Anderson) Did you hear
Moreno's latest stump speech?

472
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:57,666
He's gonna clean up Washington.

473
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:59,134
[Scoffs] Yeah, right.

474
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:01,136
Like any politician
from New Jersey

475
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:02,371
has ever cleaned up...

476
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:04,740
Who else knows
that you leaked that ad?

477
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,642
You and I had
the only two copies, Hal.

478
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,810
I don't care that you did it.

479
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:11,279
I just want to
make sure it worked.

480
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:15,550
This morning's tracking
has me within two points.

481
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:17,018
Told you.

482
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:20,088
We're gonna
pull this thing off.

483
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:22,391
Your blood test for d.I.C.
Came back completely normal.

484
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,259
That's good news, right?

485
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:24,993

We checked your home

<i>(Foreman)</i> <i>Have you visited any

It's not just your liver
we have to worry about.

497
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:52,053
Looks like your kidneys
are having problems, too.

498
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,515
So this guy spends
his entire life

499

bleeding hearts.

500
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:05,487
And it turns out he has one.

501
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:06,855

not a cardiac one.

What about henoch-schoenlein
purpura?

510
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:21,236
H.S.P. Doesn't cause clots.

I was starting to think
that my holier-than-thou-dar

720
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:53,475

728
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:07,989
Prostitution.

729
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:08,990
So you're rehired.

730
00:27:16,132 --> 00:27:18,366

00:27:41,357 --> 00:27:43,224
That is, until...

745
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:46,728
He leaked this hurtful,
hateful ad.

746
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:48,296

Look, I know you've got hep c.

773
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,970
So either you shared
a bed together,

you shared a needle,

00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,785
Don't care.

781
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,254

I don't have it.

783
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,624
Apparently your liver picked up

784
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:22,259
a few of your campaign tactics.

785
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:23,360
It's hiding all your secrets

786
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:24,861

787
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,631
so the hep c tests
come back negative.

788
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:29,432
Now, I could look
for all the associated toxins,

789

to sleep with her,

A German research study

855
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:59,115
showed that 15%
of patients with hep c

856
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,650
were cured
after contracting hep a.

857
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,218
Of course, other studies
have shown

858
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,887
that up to 85% of
doubly-infected patients

So, in theory, if we can find
something that mimics hep a...

Better chance it'll kill him.

We'll see who's right.

870
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:26,543
It's not an approved treatment

871
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,211

valid objection.

00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:59,309
But I need to know that he
actually has the disease.

887
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:00,477
Get me proof.

888
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:02,178

Get me proof he has hep c,

890
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,249
and then you can
give him hep a.

891
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,784
I can't.

892
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,018

<i>something out.</i>

893
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,654
The two of you have combined
I.Q. North of 300.

894
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:16,326
That's also true
of five morons.

895
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,697
Go. Work.

896
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:21,598
(Masters) So what do we do now?

897
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:23,900
Well, considering the fact

898
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,468
that I'm about to do
something unethical...

899
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,337
Oh, right, yeah...
I'm fired.

901
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,344
We need a false positive

(Foreman) And why would
we want to do that?

903

Evidence, not proof.

Are we presenting this
to a jury of our peers?

911
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,027
That should be enough
for Cuddy.

912
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,529
Should be, but it won't be.

Okay, go do it.

922
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,679
I have a problem.

923

A medical problem

924
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:48,918
which could become...

925
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,421
I have lied to Cuddy
10,000 times.

I think you probably
already know the answer.

928
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:01,097
But it doesn't make any sense.

929
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,366
You don't understand
why a woman might be upset

930
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,467
because her boyfriend
lied to her?

931
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,269
I wouldn't be lying
as her boyfriend.

932
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,770
I'd be lying as her employee.

933
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:10,206
That's not
how relationships work.

00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,114
Does the lie guarantee
he'll live?

936
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,949
No.

937
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,351
You got two choices:

938
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,886
To be honest and face
the medical consequences,

939
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,655
or lie and face
the personal consequences.

940

Now that you're my doctor,
you, uh...

941

You can't tell anybody, right?

from doing cocaine?

944
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:15,638
You didn't fill out
any paperwork.

to coax a patient
into a treatment

977

Don't.

979

I'm not gonna lie to him.

980
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:43,470
You have a math degree.

981

So let's see
if you can follow along here.

982
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:47,741
You lie to him,
he definitely consents,

983
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:48,942
he might live.

984
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,810
You tell him the truth
like last time,

985
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:51,845
he might not consent,

986
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:56,082
he definitely dies.

about lying?

counter-intuitive,

but in some people,

992
00:38:11,532 --> 00:38:13,500
the virus can enhance
immune function

993

00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:24,924
Gloating requires
a lot of paperwork.

1063
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,025
[Smacks]

1064
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,399
[Cheers and applause]

1065
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:35,168
<i>[Anderson on TV]</i>
<i>Thank you, New Jersey</i>

1066
00:41:35,236 --> 00:41:38,938
<i>for reelecting me</i>
<i>to the United States senate.</i>

1067
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:40,874
[Cheers and applause]

1068
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:42,776
We ran a positive campaign,

1069
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:46,746
a campaign about the dire issues
facing this great nation.

1070
00:41:46,814 --> 00:41:49,182
[Cheering]

1071
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,384
<i>There are many people</i>
<i>who gave their all</i>

1072
00:41:51,452 --> 00:41:52,352
<i>for this campaign.</i>

1073
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:54,187
But there is one person

1074
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:58,324
that stands out among them.

1075
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,026
My beautiful wife, Loretta.

1076
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:01,027
Loretta.

1077
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:04,063
[Applause]

1078
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:05,965
<i>Thank you.</i>

1079
00:42:10,504 --> 00:42:12,205
Do you know where
the senator's records are?

1080
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:14,808
House was treating Anderson's
campaign manager,

1081
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,242
not the senator himself.

1082
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,610
Oh.

1083
00:42:17,678 --> 00:42:18,812
Why did you think <i>he</i>
was the patient?

1084
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:20,213
House saw him in the clinic.

1085
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:21,347
I guess it wasn't medical.

1086
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:23,516
When?

1087
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:25,218
Friday.
Around 3.

1088
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:29,823
House's team ran a hep c test
on Joe dugan on Friday.

1089
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,723
Can you look up the time?

1090
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:37,230
Chase, Taub, and foreman
were running tests all night.

1091
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:39,199
All negative.

1092
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:42,635
<i>Positive test at...</i>

1093
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:44,771
3:17 P.M.

1094
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:46,172
House ran it himself.

1095
00:42:48,242 --> 00:42:49,342
Is everything okay?

1096
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,744
I don't think so.
