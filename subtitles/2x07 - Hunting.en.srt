1
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:03,178
My offer's withdrawn,
you can walk to work.

2
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:07,669
Got it, you're morally outraged.
Now can we get through this part
'cause the next part's awesome?

3
00:00:07,763 --> 00:00:12,163
How do you rationalise
something like this? You broke
into Stacy's therapist's office...

4
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:12,984
Borrowed a key.

5
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:15,291
...and stole her treatment notes!

6
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,245
Nope! I made copies.

7
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,685
Mark is, and I quote,
[Wilson groans]

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,100
"Withdrawn, passive-aggressive,
won't communicate, like he resents me
because I can walk"

9
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,262
I don't want to hear this.

10
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:28,756
Dishes in the sink,
toilet seat up.

11
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:31,629
Meanwhile, she can't
stop thinking about...

12
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:36,499
I can't read that,
is she obsessed with
a Grey Horse? Or me?

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,511
It says she thinks
you're an annoying jerk.

14
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:41,013
It's a pet name.

15
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:43,009
Here's the kicker.

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,578
They're not having sex?

17
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:54,735
Doctor cleared him,
but no liftoff.

18
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:57,525
She's frustrated
so she's doc-blocking me.

19
00:00:57,732 --> 00:01:00,764
Paperwork, seminars,
meddling with my patients.

20
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:02,472
Great, now you've got
the proof you need. Just...

21
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:06,743
take those personal psych
records to Cuddy, that'll show
her Stacy's out of control.

22
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:08,790
You ignoring me?

23
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:12,492
While looking for my newspaper,
efficient huh?

24
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:14,421
Kalvin:
Over here!

25
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:20,051
[Sighs] Dr. Wilson,
I want you to meet my stalker.

26
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:21,965
Your waiting room sucks.

27
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,575
I am not treating you.

28
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,645
What, because
you're a closet-case?

29
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:29,035
Err...we're not...
err... together.

30
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,518
He is so self-loathing.

31
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:34,405
Well, we've got to go now,
so maybe see you after work...

32
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,927
No no no! Ah...

33
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,104
Nobody can figure out
what's wrong with me.

34
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:46,104
Well, your shirt is gaping
at the collar, means
you lost weight, you're flushed,

35
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,461
that's fever, and
you're short of breath.

36
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,314
And finally there's
the KS lesion on your face.

37
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:54,008
Means you're HIV positive,
you've progressed
to full-blown AIDS.

38
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:57,112
So you're sick because
our immune system is shot
and someone sneezed on you.

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,440
am I excused now?

40
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:02,416
Brilliant, but,
my immune system is fine.

41
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:06,515
Your concentration camp
physique begs to differ.
Get your T-cell count re-checked.

42
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,729
I've already done that.

43
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:09,739
They test for
T-cell lymphoma?

44
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,062
It was negative.

45
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:14,243
All of this will be fascinating
to an HIV specialist.

46
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,885
Now let go of my cane before
it becomes your new boyfriend.

47
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,551
Honey, I will marry it
if you would look at my file.

48
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:21,411
Congress says you can't, so...

49
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:28,311
[Car alarm goes off]

50
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,083
[Wheezes]

51
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,761
I didn't touch him.

52
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,062
He's going into
anaphylactic shock.

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,188
2x07 - Hunting

54
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,530
Original Airdate (FOX): 22-NOV-2005

55
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:14,922
- Go see Stacy.
- We gave him epi, he's fine.

56
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:17,280
You need a lawyer,
go see Stacy.

57
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:18,533
You hit a patient.

58
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:20,091
Four words, two mistakes.

59
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:21,959
He's not a patient,
and I didn't hit him.

60
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,534
Of course you didn't.
Go see Stacy.

61
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:25,599
I didn't cause
the anaphylaxis.

62
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:28,182
It's probably one of
his HIV meds abacavir.

63
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,451
I'll pass that along,
make sure
the ER takes him off it.

64
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,578
Go see Stacy.

65
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:35,719
You have to treat him.

66
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:38,180
Medically this case
is a snooze-fest.

67
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:39,528
AIDS plus infection.

68
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,610
You don't treat him,
he charges you with assault.

69
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:44,068
Just 'cause he says I hit him
doesn't make it true.

70
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:47,568
Watch, I am surrounded
by naked cheerleaders.

71
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:48,969
See?

72
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,006
Although I like my chances
of some action this morning.

73
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:56,749
I forgot
Wednesday was hooker day.
This could've waited!

74
00:03:58,045 --> 00:04:00,229
You make me meet you
at your house,

75
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,972
your husband is
conveniently absent.

76
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:04,602
Mark's at physio.

77
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:06,896
I'm stuck waiting
for the exterminator.

78
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:09,392
I saw a rat last night.

79
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:13,068
Well, I'm surprised
your feet are touching the floor.

80
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,611
I barely slept.

81
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:16,189
What was Mark up to?

82
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:21,648
Memory serves,
quick climb up Mt. Gregory and
you dozed through a seal hunt.

83
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,416
Clubbing, shrieking.

84
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:24,958
What're you doing?

85
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,957
Sorry, it's driving me nuts.

86
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,851
You hate washing dishes.

87
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,245
People change.

88
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:40,462
I could make sure you
sleep like a baby tonight.

89
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,581
Rather take care of that myself.

90
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:47,851
I was referring to the rat.

91
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,361
Trenton Pests is sending a guy.

92
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:56,128
Mark:
What's going on?

93
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,185
It's not what you think.

94
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:03,387
I know it looks like
we're cleaning dishes but
actually, we're having sex.

95
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:04,510
We're working.

96
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:07,077
Wow, wish
I'd become a doctor.

97
00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:09,128
Place would be spotless.

98
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:15,021
Take ten minutes,
cure the guy, and stop whining.

99
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,498
I give you Kalvin Ryan.

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,413
So flamboyant in person,
so boring on paper.

101
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:28,314
Obviously got an
opportunistic infection,
probably TB or PCP.

102
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:30,541
Have you read his file?

103
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:34,128
I started, but I found
the characters two-dimensional.

104
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:36,371
He went to
a HIV clinic last week.

105
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:40,522
Tested negative for
TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV.

106
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,566
It's not an infection.

107
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,701
HIV clinic.
So few patients, so much money.
Re-do the tests.

108
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:47,049
The results make sense.

109
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:50,254
Kalvin's T-cells are at 200,
that's strong enough
to fight infection.

110
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:51,707
Fine, parasite.

111
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,454
Nope, stool sample
was negative.

112
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,465
Two months ago,
he was down to 30 T-cells,
then he changed his meds,

113
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:59,626
his immune system rebounds,
his viral load drops,

114
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,237
everything's getting better
but he's getting sicker.

115
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:07,751
Face it, this might be
an interesting case.

116
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:17,032
What if his immune system
is too strong.

117
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:20,804
An auto-immune disease
with HIV, that's impossible.

118
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:25,326
His new HIV meds kicked
his system out of a sound sleep.

119
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,843
Wakes up hungry,
cranky, spoiling for a fight.

120
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,035
When it doesn't find
an active infection,

121
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,401
starts attacking
the harmless remnants
of old infections.

122
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:36,993
Immune reconstitution syndrome.

123
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:40,957
His meds made him
so much better,
he made himself sick.

124
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,403
- Sounds pretty...
- BORING!

125
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,147
This is so not interesting.

126
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:48,648
Chest X-ray and
find the old infections,
start him on steroids.

127
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:56,538
If you're wrong,
steroids will tank his immune system.
He'll get worse.

128
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:58,758
Now THAT would be interesting.

129
00:06:58,867 --> 00:06:59,818
Where's the coumadin?

130
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,907
If your patient's got
a blood problem then
blood thinners aren't exactly...

131
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:07,023
It's for Stacy's rat.
Death by anti-coagulation.

132
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:11,235
Trying to win Stacy back
by killing an animal...

133
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:12,483
very caveman.

134
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:14,444
I don't want her back.

135
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:16,929
I just want her to
admit her feelings for me.

136
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:22,730
I go to Cuddy,
Cuddy fires her or re-assigns her.
Either way, I'm happy.

137
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:29,289
If you want her back,
either tell her,
or, better yet, shut up,

138
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:31,420
and cry yourself to sleep
like everybody else.

139
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:35,405
Hi, this is Mark Warner,
1724 Spring street.

140
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,640
Listen, you don't need
to send that guy down,
we caught him.

141
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:42,582
No, you should send the bill to
Princeton-Plainsborough hospital.

142
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,043
Attn: Dr James Wilson.

143
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:46,225
Yeah.

144
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,054
Your lymph nodes ren't swollen.
That's good.

145
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:55,476
Maybe Dr. Chase should check.

146
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,409
Sorry mate, hands full.

147
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:02,169
He's too pretty to be straight.
You ever done any modeling?

148
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:04,179
Does anyone actually
fall for that line?

149
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:07,546
Everyday.
Why do you think
I became a photographer?

150
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:12,020
I'm guessing
you guys didn't think
about dating on career day.

151
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:15,742
- I love my job.
- Really?

152
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:20,183
You seem more the
'find it exceptionally satisfying' type.

153
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:22,910
I'm not sure
there's a difference.

154
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:25,766
Your mom died of diabetes,
how's your dad's health?

155
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,879
Last I heard,
he had cirrhosis.

156
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:35,561
Love is love,
satisfying is social validation,
fun can wait.

157
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,030
I have fun.

158
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:39,590
Yeah, she's got
some scheduled for February.

159
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:41,725
Chase:
Last you heard?
Your father?

160
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,757
He threw me out
when I was 16.

161
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:48,631
It's just as well, I got tired of
getting BB guns for my birthday
when I'd asked for a Barbie.

162
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,007
Dads can be real sweethearts.

163
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:54,289
Mmm, sensitive, AND cute.

164
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:57,540
He's cute.

165
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:09,290
It ran into that
heating vent right there.

166
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,172
Hopefully Mark's anger
will go away eventually.

167
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:17,498
He's not angry,
just doesn't like you.

168
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,229
Nothing unique there.

169
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:21,812
Didn't seem really
wild about you either.

170
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:24,214
He's fine with me.

171
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:27,374
He's angry.
Said so in group.

172
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,948
Of course he's angry,
he's looking at months
of painful physio.

173
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:33,050
[Sniffs]
He's mad at you.

174
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:35,059
There's no way he said that.

175
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:41,020
[Sighs]
No, but it's true.

176
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,076
He resents you
for being able to walk.

177
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:49,847
I've been there.

178
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:56,225
I resented you
for hell of a long time.

179
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,599
Past tense?

180
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,747
[Phone starts to ring]

181
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:09,312
Might be the hospital.

182
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,299
What!?

183
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,900
[Phone is on speaker]
Bad time? Where are you?

184
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,207
Hosue:
<i>At your girlfriend's place.
Ignore the moaning and squeaking.</i>

185
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,625
His lungs are too scarred to tell
which infection triggered
the immune reconstitution.

186
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:30,286
He a smoker?

187
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:32,909
Cameron:
<i>Yes, and possible
more than cigarettes.</i>

188
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:36,124
His tox screen came back
positive for recreational drugs.

189
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,834
House:
<i>Not surprising.
Not medically relevant.</i>

190
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,429
His heart looks
a little enlarged.

191
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:43,000
House:
<i>That's a typical
side-effect of AZT.</i>

192
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:45,106
House:
<i>What are Kalvin's
most recent infections?</i>

193
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:47,755
Toxo, CMV and PCP.

194
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:49,134
[Squeaking]

195
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:53,524
[Whispers]
Well let's assume
it's one of those.

196
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:55,817
House:
<i>Give him Ganciclovir
for the CMV...</i>

197
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,930
Woah,
we can hardly hear you.
Where are you?

198
00:10:58,014 --> 00:11:01,667
House: <i>In a closet.</i>
Your girlfriend's other
boyfriend showed up.

199
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,576
Ganciclovir for the CMV,

200
00:11:05,973 --> 00:11:11,167
Sulfadiazin for the Toxo,
Bactrim for PCP.

201
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:16,195
Gotta go, it's killing time.

202
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:46,173
Cameron:
Your tox screen
came back positive for...

203
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:50,050
Crystal meth
and...ecstasy.

204
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:53,894
Recreational drugs are
dangerous to begin with,
but for someone with HIV...

205
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,675
I didn't mistake them
for vitamins.

206
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:59,117
[Whispers]
I'm a P&P boy.

207
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,584
Party and Play.

208
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:03,902
Drugs and sex.

209
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:06,760
[Coughs]

210
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:11,125
You don't approve?

211
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:14,831
Does the sex include condoms?

212
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,375
If he's negative, sure.
If he's positive...

213
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:21,490
why put on a raincoat
if you're already wet?

214
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,954
You could get hepatitis
or another strain of HIV.

215
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:25,322
Or I could get hit by a bus.

216
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:27,028
AIDS isn't a
death sentence anymore.

217
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,478
I don't want to
have any regrets.

218
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,928
[Starts coughing again]

219
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:35,812
How long have
you been coughing?

220
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:42,079
Ah...about an hour or so.
[Coughs]

221
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:43,837
Try to take a deep breath.

222
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:46,375
[Coughs]

223
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:47,915
What is it?

224
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:49,927
I think its blood.

225
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:54,474
[Starts coughing again]

226
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,391
I recommend
post-exposure prophylaxis.

227
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,670
Your chances of conversion are slim,

228
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:11,416
but I'd like to put you
on three antiviral medications.

229
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:15,810
Finavir, zidovudine and lamivudine.

230
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:21,011
There are side-effects;
headache, nausea, vivid dreaming.

231
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:27,559
You'll be tested for HIV
in 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months...

232
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:32,950
Very interesting.

233
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:37,573
He coughs infected blood
in Cameron's eyes and mouth,
that's interesting?

234
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:41,101
The coughing part,
not the in Cameron part.

235
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:44,753
New symptom,
blood vessel ruptured in his lung.

236
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,387
I closed the tear.

237
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:49,485
Well it takes
immune reconstitution
off the table.

238
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:51,399
What's it put on the table?

239
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:55,049
Its ok, she's not here.
You can skip the nice guy acts.

240
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:58,492
You know some human beings are
actually capable of human feelings.

241
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:01,532
My giving a damn or not
is not going to change
what happened.

242
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:03,571
Could be Kaposi's Syndrome.

243
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:05,879
No edema,
no blood in urine.

244
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:09,373
KS on his face could mean
KS in his lungs, with
bleeding from the lesions.

245
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:11,857
I would have seen them
when I repaired the tear in his lung.

246
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:13,609
Wegener's granulomatosis?

247
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:16,094
Wegener's would have
responded to the steroids.

248
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,472
Maybe you should go home,
take the rest of the day.

249
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:20,714
I'm fine.

250
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:27,589
Oh this is good,
he's pretending to care,
you're pretending not to.

251
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:31,459
I think we should
reconsider drugs.
Kalvin uses crystal meth.

252
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:34,807
Concerned enough
about his health to stalk me

253
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:38,332
while indulging in
deadly street drugs.

254
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:40,390
Study in contradictions.

255
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:42,961
Interesting.
Still not medically relevant.

256
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,494
It could be,
if his drugs were tainted.

257
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,418
They cook meth with
battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...

258
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:51,166
Find Kalvin's pills,
test for toxins.

259
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:55,046
Foreman, you're with me.

260
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:03,630
I need a consult
on another case.

261
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:04,741
You have another case?

262
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:06,927
It's a hip-pocket deal.

263
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,694
Patient presents
with a distinct neck tilt.

264
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,094
*****
Is he an athlete?

265
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:13,794
He's a regular runner.

266
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,619
Any pain associated
with movement.

267
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,761
None that he's complained of.

268
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:21,660
Best case scenario,
an infection in the ear or lungs.

269
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:23,690
Worst case,
brain stem tumour.

270
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:26,422
Should do an MRI,
CAT scan, full work-up.

271
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:29,478
Uhh..I don't think so.

272
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:31,559
No insurance.

273
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:38,903
No drugs in here.
I'll take the bathroom.

274
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:43,748
How about a drink after work?
Take your mind off what happened.

275
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:50,325
Cameron?

276
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:53,687
I might have HIV,
a drink's not going to wash it away.

277
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:56,453
There's like zero chance of
you contracting the virus.

278
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:59,092
Big difference between
'like zero' and 'zero'.

279
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:02,344
What did the infection
control guy tell you?

280
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:08,431
He was very reassuring,
kept reminding me that
the hospital covers all my medical costs.

281
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:10,863
Apparently forgot to mention
that if I do test positive,

282
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:15,288
that they'll pass it on to legal
and legal will dig up any dirt
they can trying to prove that I'm a...

283
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,193
drug user or tramp, and
that's why I have HIV.

284
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:21,740
It's not like they're going
to find anything, right?

285
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:23,785
Right.

286
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,259
Check this out.

287
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:29,164
Chase:
Kalvin's a photographer.
The broken bulbs were props.

288
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,458
Glass is from
1930's fluorescent.

289
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:32,746
Some of the bulbs
have date stamps.

290
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,826
Pre-World War II fluorescent bulbs
contained large amounts of beryllium.

291
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,652
Beryllium dust inflames the lungs,
they get rigid, patient can't breathe.

292
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:44,625
My father co-authored a paper
on acute berylliosis.

293
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:47,915
Phew! For a moment there
I thought you were smart.

294
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,326
Cameron, get a biopsy of
Calvin's lung tissue.

295
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,869
I want a spectrographic analysis.

296
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:53,819
I can handle it.

297
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:56,658
No reason to risk
exposing the entire team.

298
00:16:56,846 --> 00:16:58,795
Then who would I torment?

299
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,528
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:08,802
About what happened.

301
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:11,033
It's best not to talk.

302
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:14,035
You're going to
feel a sharp pinch.

303
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:17,318
This actually is going to
grab a piece of your lung.

304
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,331
What were you guys
looking for at my hotel?

305
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:29,561
Your drugs. Thought maybe
you'd used toxic meth.

306
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:32,599
We'll know if you're exposed
to beryllium in a few hours.

307
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:37,952
Well if you're still curious, it's...
in my bag over there on the chair.

308
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:41,214
You brought drugs
into the hospital?!

309
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:43,943
Glad I wasted my time
at your hotel.

310
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:46,927
I told you I used,
you didn't ask me for a sample.

311
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:51,156
You're not pissed about this,
you're mad because
I coughed blood on you.

312
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:52,229
That was an accident.

313
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:57,576
Oh, would you stop being nice!
It's useless and worse, it's boring.

314
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,502
Get angry!
I had one stupid night,
I end up with HIV,

315
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:03,390
do you have any idea
how pissed off I was?

316
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,825
This wasn't your fault.

317
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:15,662
You broke into my house?

318
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,453
Why I had to,
Mark isn't here.

319
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:19,814
He has physio.

320
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,479
Oh really?
How's he doing?

321
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,460
What happened
with all the cheese?

322
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:27,016
I had to get rid of it before
Steve McQueen ate any coumadin.

323
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,396
I named your rat.

324
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,018
Steve's tilting his head.

325
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:40,732
Any neurologist will tell you
that suggests an infection
or brain stem tumour.

326
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,890
Death cures both those things.

327
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:44,578
Well we can't kill him.

328
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:48,824
If it's an infection,
it could be caused by
something in your house,

329
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,637
something that
could affect you guys.

330
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:55,030
Smell this.

331
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:56,142
[Sniffs]

332
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:58,429
- Does it smell like urine?
- Oh!

333
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,146
[Sniffs]

334
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,655
You missing any asparagus?

335
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:08,555
Ok, stuff these,
he doesn't get better,
then it's a tumour.

336
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,799
Then what? Chemo?

337
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:14,340
Steve McQueen without hair?

338
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,167
It's a blessing
he died young.

339
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:19,926
[Phone rings]

340
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:25,806
Hello.

341
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:32,209
Oh, hi honey.
I'm sorry I missed you,
yeah, I came home.

342
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:35,727
Alright, I'll see you
in a few minutes.

343
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:39,326
Okay, bye hun.

344
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:54,330
Chest hurts!
[Monitors are beeping]

345
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,650
He's a hundred and climbing,
could be an allergic reaction.

346
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:59,655
Neck pains are out,
must be pericardial effusion.

347
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,783
No wheezing.

348
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:03,715
Tear in his lungs
must have re-opened.

349
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:07,196
Kalvin, you're bleeding into
the area around your heart.

350
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,868
I'm dying?
I can't breathe!

351
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:13,449
The blood's crushing your heart,
once we remove it, you'll be fine.

352
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,523
If I die, please tell my dad...

353
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:16,978
You're not going to die.

354
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:20,106
...tell... him... sorry.

355
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:24,332
[Monitors are beeping]

356
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:33,305
Where's the blood?

357
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,499
It's clear.

358
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:38,097
Only one other thing
could cause this.

359
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,000
Tumour in his heart.

360
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:50,409
Wilson:
CT confirmed a mass in Kalvin's heart
and several smaller ones in his lungs.

361
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:52,750
That's why his heart's
enlarged, not the AZT.

362
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,030
You ok?

363
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,024
She's fine, probably getting
bored with the question.

364
00:20:57,196 --> 00:21:00,051
Masses in the heart and lungs,
what kind of cancer are we looking at?

365
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,332
They may not be cancerous.

366
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,420
This is classic
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

367
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:05,535
HIV positive patient
with a primary heart mass.

368
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:06,947
It could be sarcoidosis.

369
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,757
His lung tissue is negative.

370
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,017
Lymphoma's a death sentence,
sarcoidosis is treatable.

371
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:15,546
So's an ear infection,
but since he didn't test
positive for that either...

372
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,831
I wanna do the
Kveim-Siltzbach test.

373
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:24,298
[Splutters] Do you have any idea
how much paperwork
Cuddy is going to need signed?

374
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:29,395
Do it.

375
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:34,388
So...

376
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:37,608
how is the patient's father?

377
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:38,967
Uh...

378
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:41,067
Tell my dad I'm sorry?

379
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:44,195
Might as well wave
the red flag at a bull.

380
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:45,785
He's not coming.

381
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:48,639
Well it's not a tragedy,

382
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:52,109
dad doesn't want to see him,
he doesn't want to see the dad.

383
00:21:52,248 --> 00:21:54,230
You're the only one
who wants them together.

384
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,299
- He asked!
- He thought he was dying.

385
00:21:57,511 --> 00:21:59,493
Dying people lie too.

386
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:04,623
Wish they'd work less,
they'd been nicer, they'd
opened orphanages for kittens.

387
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:09,410
If you really want to do something,
you do it, you don't save it for sound byte.

388
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:15,003
What did you say when
you thought you were dying?

389
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:19,330
On the other hand,

390
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:23,553
his dad tossed him out.

391
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,626
So what's our guy
want to apologise for?

392
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:29,712
Everybody has regrets.

393
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,100
Cameron:
The growths in your lungs
and heart are sarcoid,

394
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,527
your body will
recognise this material

395
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:44,239
and we'll see
a reaction on your arm.

396
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:48,802
Did you really
want to see your dad?

397
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,529
Did you call him?

398
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,747
Thanks.

399
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:58,799
He would have come,
try to straighten me out.

400
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,845
How are you holding up?

401
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:04,696
- I'm fine.
- Convincing.

402
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,877
What did you do with my drugs?

403
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,338
The lab disposes of them
after analysis.

404
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:10,802
Too bad.

405
00:23:11,152 --> 00:23:13,157
They could have
done you some good.

406
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,253
Not really my thing.

407
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:21,653
You know I hope
you don't have it, but...

408
00:23:22,004 --> 00:23:26,265
getting HIV
might have been the best thing
that ever happened to me.

409
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,439
I used to be a good boy.

410
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:32,486
Never wanted to
piss anybody off...

411
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:38,881
playing by the rules
makes everybody else happy.

412
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:42,077
Now I'm happy.

413
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:49,815
So you just show up
every time he's at physio?

414
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:55,735
Off course not!
Also when he's at group therapy,
or out for dinner with friends.

415
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:59,675
And when she happens
to mention to Mark
that you dropped by...?

416
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:01,736
You tell your wife everything?

417
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:06,410
It's a... process. [Sighs]

418
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:11,431
But Stacy doesn't have
any reason to hide this from Mark.

419
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:14,519
As far as she knows,
Mark's okay with you being there.

420
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:17,180
My bet is she mentions me
to Mark as little as possible,

421
00:24:17,284 --> 00:24:20,762
'cause she thinks that he thinks
that she still has feelings for me.

422
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:22,775
And you know
why she thinks that?

423
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:25,987
Because she still has
feelings for you? [Elevator dings]

424
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:29,674
If you're right, she did tell him,
and I don't get through the door tonight.

425
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:32,605
But if I'm right...

426
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,445
So how long
do we stay here?

427
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,549
'Til something happens.

428
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:50,263
He's not going to come out
with us right here.

429
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:56,229
We are downwind, and
he seems to have hearing loss.

430
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:58,453
He's not blind.

431
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:01,969
Steve McQueen
does not run from danger.

432
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:07,360
Antibiotics on the other hand...

433
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:11,440
He ate around the pill? Smart!

434
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,407
Admit it, you like him.

435
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,754
He's alright...for a rat.

436
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:20,901
You wanna know
how cool he is?

437
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:26,977
His urine showed
traces of hydrogen cyanide,
formaldehyde, lead.

438
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,628
He's a smoker.

439
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:33,731
Your husband's been lighting up...

440
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:37,708
which is particularly stupid,
it could cause his AIP to...

441
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,894
Okay, I blow my smoke
into the vents
so Mark doesn't know.

442
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:44,768
I always knew it.

443
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,150
Bluffing!

444
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:50,923
You started
two weeks after my surgery.

445
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,517
Menthols, then
lights after a month.

446
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:55,365
Why didn't you say anything?

447
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:58,296
'Cause it helped me
monitor your misery level.

448
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:04,982
One trip outside was a good day,
upwards of six you were in hell.

449
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:09,196
You could have
asked me how I was!

450
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:13,402
I already knew.

451
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:17,536
Sorry you were miserable.

452
00:26:20,554 --> 00:26:23,647
Sorry I caused you
so much pain.

453
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:33,067
[Clangs]

454
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,855
[Squeaking]

455
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:38,176
Aha.

456
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,902
[Music from inside the room]
[Knocks on the door]

457
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:47,135
Glad you changed your mind
about that drink.

458
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,599
Come on in.

459
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:52,591
You should get changed,
there's this new place
on campus that...

460
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:03,973
- Are you high?
- Uh huh.

461
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:09,175
I thought
you disposed of the drugs.

462
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,931
Not all of it.

463
00:27:13,743 --> 00:27:16,725
Uhh, slow down...

464
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:19,243
Your pupils are dilated!

465
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:22,654
Come on Chase,
don't turn into a
good guy on me now.

466
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:59,889
You're late.
And hungover.

467
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:03,413
Or maybe not.

468
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:06,131
Why do you have a rat?

469
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:09,611
Jealous?
[Elevator dings]

470
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:17,092
Kalvin:
[Shouting] Out of my room!
Don't you dare put this on me!

471
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,251
Kalvin:
I'm not going to grovel, dad!

472
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:20,872
That's not what I'm asking for.

473
00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:23,507
Like hell it isn't!
You said you didn't call!

474
00:28:26,077 --> 00:28:28,197
Don't mind me.
Just here for the show.

475
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:30,872
Yeah well, there's
not going to be any.

476
00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:35,529
What happened to the big apology?
Yesterday he was all
"daddy, I'm so sowwy".

477
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,801
This is none of your business.

478
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:39,344
You should have thought of that
before you stalked me.

479
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:40,821
Now I'm interested.

480
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:43,902
So what's he got to apologise for?
You're the one who tossed him out.

481
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:45,055
Now why would I do that?

482
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:47,951
I don't know.
'Cause it's tough to brag
to your hunting buddies

483
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:49,805
that your son knows
all the words of the whiz.

484
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:50,569
That's a lie!

485
00:28:50,653 --> 00:28:52,438
- 42nd Street?
- Oh, tchick!

486
00:28:52,507 --> 00:28:56,256
Much easier to just
get drunk and beat him.
Explains his hating you.

487
00:28:56,356 --> 00:28:58,073
Also your cirrhosis.

488
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:01,740
Also why the more I talk,
the more you sweat.

489
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:06,410
What it doesn't explain, is
why he's gotta apologise to you.

490
00:29:07,627 --> 00:29:11,180
Residual guilt for
sharing your special toy
with other boys?

491
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:13,303
Just leave it alone.

492
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:15,679
Just want to leave the bigot
with some peace of mind
after you're gone?

493
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:19,509
Look, this has got nothing,
and I mean nothing
to do with him being gay!

494
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:23,147
Now Kal brought this on himself,
with what he did to his mother!

495
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:24,857
He steal her signature look?

496
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,516
No, no. He killed her.

497
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,641
Kalvin lied!

498
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:41,191
Yeah, that certainly is shocking.

499
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:46,687
Mom's kidneys were failing,
she needed a transplant,
they tested Kalvin, he was a match.

500
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,612
He was also positive for HIV,
mom never found a qualified donor,
she dies.

501
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,740
Tragic tale.

502
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:58,621
Undercut slightly
by the rapid fire delivery
and constant movement.

503
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:00,333
Too much coffee
this morning?

504
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:03,599
He didn't kill her.
Our bodies aren't donor farms
for our parents.

505
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:06,954
It's not 1980. We know
how HIV is transmitted!

506
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,124
If Kalvin got HIV
through unprotected sex,
dad has every right to be pissed!

507
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,627
So you always use a condom?

508
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:13,982
Uhh... yeah!

509
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:15,902
Brother's
on the down-low, got to.

510
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:18,047
Huh, not ready for any
Foreman Juniors yet.

511
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:18,674
You?

512
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,922
Working girls are sticklers.

513
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:24,191
You're not going to pull Chase?

514
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,060
I'm not an idiot.

515
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:29,939
Obviously not.

516
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:33,452
Who doesn't sleep with
a drugged out colleague
when they have a chance?

517
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:40,549
Where's Wilson?

518
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:44,279
We got the result
for the Kveim test.

519
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:47,901
[Sighs]

520
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:55,314
So... I have cancer?

521
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:58,865
In all likelihood, yeah.

522
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:01,731
Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma.

523
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:07,646
And I am... dying?

524
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:15,649
We need to biopsy the tumour.
It's near your aorta so...

525
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:18,146
getting that sample
carries serious risks.

526
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:20,195
Is my dad still here?

527
00:31:21,494 --> 00:31:23,334
He hasn't been in?

528
00:31:27,912 --> 00:31:32,061
We'll inject a dye around your heart
to make the tumour visible on the CT,

529
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:36,220
then a surgeon
inserts a guide wire,
runs it up into your heart

530
00:31:36,304 --> 00:31:40,787
where he takes a small piece of
that tumour so we can look at it
under the microscope.

531
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:45,336
Chase: Ativan
will help settle you down.

532
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,155
Why are you so calm?

533
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,412
Not coming off meth helps.

534
00:31:51,697 --> 00:31:54,279
Last night probably
shouldn't happen again.

535
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:56,339
Do you think I want it to?

536
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,018
When two people have had sex,
unless it sucks,

537
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:02,724
if they can do it again,
they're gonna do it again.

538
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:05,373
And that's when
things get complicated.

539
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:08,879
And it didn't suck.

540
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:17,795
So now you've got to drum up
another excuse to be
around the love of your life.

541
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:20,149
Could hit another patient.

542
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:23,574
Nyah, don't like to repeat myself.
People will say I'm formulaic.

543
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:26,132
Well that rules out
letting the rat go so
you can catch him again.

544
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:27,294
I can't do that.

545
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:30,161
Steve needs
two weeks antibiotics and
a smoke-free environment.

546
00:32:30,245 --> 00:32:32,367
Cigarettes
aggravated his infection.

547
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,486
The rat is actually sick?

548
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:36,156
That thing could
infect the entire hospital!

549
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,324
Steve's infection is
not contagious to humans.

550
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:42,986
I'm an idiot.
How did I miss micoplasmosis?
Was that the kid's father?

551
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:46,175
Yeah.
Remember the black death?
Started with rats.

552
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:48,642
What's he doing in the hallway?
His kid getting his biopsy already?

553
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:49,789
He just won't go in the room.

554
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:52,655
Who knows what else he has?
Parasites? Bacterial infection?

555
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,729
- Kid doesn't have parasites.
- Not the kid, the rat!

556
00:32:56,362 --> 00:32:57,778
Was he still sweating?

557
00:32:57,964 --> 00:33:00,142
Rats only sweat
through their tails.

558
00:33:00,226 --> 00:33:02,101
Not the rat, the dad!

559
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:05,827
Where are they from?

560
00:33:05,908 --> 00:33:08,404
Err...Montana.
What's going on?

561
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:10,107
You were right,
it's a parasite.

562
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:12,591
Cancel the biopsy.
It'll kill him.

563
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,762
[Bangs]

564
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:15,616
Hey daddy, come with me!

565
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,220
Yeah, uhh...
I'm not going in there.

566
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:21,983
[Sighs]

567
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:24,502
Your son asked to talk to you.

568
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:29,463
Why is he here?

569
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:33,345
He wanted to talk to you.

570
00:33:33,415 --> 00:33:34,497
Aha.

571
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,974
Did you two use to
hunt together?

572
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:39,105
Foxes. Did you kill foxes?

573
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:40,804
It's Montana.

574
00:33:41,892 --> 00:33:44,639
Those masses in your chest
are not tumours.

575
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:48,252
They're parasitic cysts
from a bug called equinococosis.

576
00:33:48,337 --> 00:33:51,947
Touch a dead fox, they jump aboard,
they can hunker down for decades

577
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:55,095
- growing, spawning,
shopping, putting on plays.

578
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:57,691
I've been tested
for parasites.

579
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,836
Okay, it's cancer.
You happy?

580
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:03,420
The cysts isolate the parasites,

581
00:34:03,504 --> 00:34:06,599
keeping them from showing up
in stool samples,
even in blood tests, cardiac...

582
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:08,373
All right,
you don't need me for this.

583
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:10,497
But you've got
the same things in your liver.

584
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:14,736
I have cirrhosis.

585
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:18,953
Liver cysts have
identical symptoms
with one addition, fever.

586
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:20,965
Now liver cysts
we can test for.

587
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:24,091
Your diagnosis
could confirm Kalvin's.

588
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:26,770
So, option A,
we draw some blood...

589
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:28,623
No, look,
you're not touching me.

590
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:30,292
You see, this is
why I need you here.

591
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,980
I want you to tell your son that
you won't take a simple painless
blood test to save his life.

592
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,931
You err... never expressed
a shred of regret for
what happened to your mother.

593
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:58,020
Geez dad...

594
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:00,669
Dad:
If you'd've worn a damn rubber,
you'd've been fine.

595
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:04,852
Dad:
Could have saved her life.
You wouldn't be lying here!

596
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,088
House:
Yeah yeah yeah, I get it!

597
00:35:08,237 --> 00:35:11,622
You're really mad at him
for killing himself and
for destroying everything you love.

598
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:14,184
I don't have time for this,
are you going to apologise?

599
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:16,244
I'm living my life
the way I want.

600
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:17,596
Are you going to
give me some blood?

601
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,199
Look,
if he doesn't give a damn
then neither do I!

602
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,341
Okay. Option B.

603
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:25,046
Why did your wife kill herself?
Did she hate you?

604
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,985
She was a diabetic!

605
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:29,182
You know, you don't know
a thing about my Suzanne.

606
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:33,217
Either Suzanne wanted to die,
or she was both fat AND stupid.

607
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:34,847
Used a twinkie instead of a gun.

608
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:37,995
And girls with big appetites, well
they just can't get enough of anything!

609
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:38,500
Shut up!

610
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:40,510
Probably nibbled on
every devil dog in the county!

611
00:35:40,594 --> 00:35:41,136
SHUT UP!

612
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,835
Just in case I'm not
making myself clear,
I don't mean the delicious snack...

613
00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:46,134
You son of a bitch!

614
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:49,624
Yeah? Come on!

615
00:35:50,502 --> 00:35:52,805
Thank you,
means I can do this.

616
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,425
We're going to need
some epi in here, stat!

617
00:35:56,509 --> 00:35:57,855
Are you out of your mind?!

618
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:59,168
You said you didn't care.

619
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:01,117
[Choking]

620
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:03,137
Notice how you can't breathe?

621
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,016
Now either that's the cane,

622
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:07,878
or I just ruptured one of those
liver cysts we were chatting about

623
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:09,564
and you've gone into
anaphylactic shock,

624
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:13,602
exactly the same as your son did
when he accidentally tripped
against my friend's car.

625
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,892
I'm just SO excited
to find out which!

626
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:22,295
[Choking and wheezing]

627
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:24,952
I'm gonna schedule surgery.

628
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:30,495
Nurse: Clamp.

629
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:34,187
Surgeon:
Pressure's holding.

630
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:19,804
Two successful surgeries,
two lives saved.

631
00:37:19,897 --> 00:37:23,187
I'm over my quota.
Can I have next week off?

632
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:26,460
Two family members assaulted.

633
00:37:26,603 --> 00:37:29,264
- It was self defence.
- You baited him.

634
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,456
You're right.
I was asking for it.

635
00:37:31,644 --> 00:37:34,378
The low-cut blouse,
the 'Do-Me' pumps.

636
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:37,702
You flooded his gut
with a parasite, he could sue.

637
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:41,307
Go see Stacy.

638
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:44,009
Okay.

639
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:50,827
That's it? Okay?
No name-calling? No squawking?
No rending of garments?

640
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,117
I like this T-shirt.

641
00:37:58,413 --> 00:37:59,907
You lied to me.

642
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:02,542
If this is about my mom...

643
00:38:02,672 --> 00:38:05,190
This is about your
lonely, miserable life.

644
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:07,106
I'm not miserable.

645
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:11,423
And as long as
there's a gay bar around,
I'm never lonely.

646
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:14,378
You haven't had a single visitor
except for your dad.

647
00:38:14,462 --> 00:38:16,662
Drugs are great,
HIV freed you,

648
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:19,168
your dad hates you,
you're so happy.

649
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:20,709
Everything's a lie!

650
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:23,103
You blame yourself
for your mom's death,

651
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:25,848
you're not trying to have fun,
you're trying to self-destruct.

652
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:29,416
You wanna kill yourself?
Fine, but stop recruiting!

653
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,757
Heard you hit another patient.

654
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:44,515
Yeah, sure. Why not?

655
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,638
He hit me first.

656
00:38:46,722 --> 00:38:49,790
Cuddy didn't mention that.
Let me see.

657
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:54,931
I'm the doctor.

658
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,116
My concern is purely legal.

659
00:38:57,727 --> 00:39:00,594
Looks okay, does it hurt?

660
00:39:00,848 --> 00:39:01,934
A little.

661
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:04,986
You need some ice.

662
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,323
There's no way that
Mark doesn't know...

663
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:17,062
about the smoking.

664
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,529
He would have
said something.

665
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,154
Then he hasn't been
near you in months.

666
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,125
We're fine.

667
00:39:31,848 --> 00:39:33,523
Can't be easy.

668
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:35,265
Stop squirming.

669
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:45,195
Why would you
lie about this?

670
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:46,903
I'm not lying.

671
00:39:48,668 --> 00:39:51,353
I don't care if you're
sleeping with him or not,
but you're not, so...

672
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:52,449
I am.

673
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,255
You're lying.

674
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,795
You know when I have sex?
You can smell that on me too?

675
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:03,598
The only people who know
about what's going on between
me and Mark, are me and Mark.

676
00:40:03,682 --> 00:40:05,539
I just know you.

677
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:13,648
And I know you.

678
00:40:14,017 --> 00:40:19,010
You're confident, arrogant,
but you're never certain unless
there's a reason to be certain.

679
00:40:19,527 --> 00:40:22,842
One other person knew,
I told you I was seeing Dr. Harper.

680
00:40:22,926 --> 00:40:26,827
You can easily get into her office,
you read my file.

681
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,913
You read my file?

682
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,320
The dishes,
the concern, the oh...

683
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:46,482
acting like a human being?

684
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:47,967
You have...

685
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:53,316
This whole time
you've been manipulating me?

686
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:58,590
You knew that
I had an angle the moment
I poured soap on to a scrub brush.

687
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:01,555
You could have
thrown me out,

688
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,937
or ignored me, or
found another exterminator.

689
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:06,179
You didn't even tell Mark
that I kept coming by.

690
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,113
You LET this happen
because you wanna be with me.

691
00:41:12,064 --> 00:41:14,292
I don't know anymore.

692
00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:17,921
Get out.

694
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:48,099
I'm sorry.

# Yesterday I got lost in the circus #

696
00:41:57,652 --> 00:42:02,027
# Feeling like such a mess #

697
00:42:05,647 --> 00:42:11,921
# And now I'm down
I'm just hanging on the corner #

698
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:17,449
# I can't help but reminisce #

699
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:27,146
# I know we all
We all got our faults #

700
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:33,431
# We get locked in our vaults,
and we stay.. #

701
00:42:33,432 --> 00:42:38,848
# When you're gone #

702
00:42:39,482 --> 00:42:46,220
# All the colours fade
When you're gone #

703
00:42:46,863 --> 00:42:54,290
# No new years day parade
You're gone #

704
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,617
# Colours seem to fade #

705
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:09,836
# Colours seem to fade #
