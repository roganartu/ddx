1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,960
He's got a temperature of 103.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,630
And why do we care?

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,590
Because we're human beings. It's what we do.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,230
He said he was at a luncheon meeting.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,720
You took his history?

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,910
Guy looks like Harpo. You should see him.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,260
You asked him what book he's currently reading.

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,500
it's hilarious to watch him try and talk.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,320
I asked him anything I could think of.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,930
Favorite color:

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,530
"Boo."

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,090
Favorite

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,440
dessert topping?

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,370
Trust me, you never know what fact may prove the key to saving your life.

15
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,700
Whipped cream.

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,690
I asked him if he was sure.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,170
Where are you going?

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,540
You're an ass.

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,530
I know.

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,410
Where are you going?

21
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,660
This is either a toxin, an infection, or an allergic reaction.

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,020
I assume you gave him epi, so that rules out allergies.

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,310
Put him on antibiotics in case it's an infection.

24
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,000
And if it's a toxin, we'll keep him here overnight,

25
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,700
let the swelling go down, send him home.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,100
I'm going to the movies.

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,180
Which one of you is House?

28
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,530
The skinny brunette.

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,060
No, that's Dr. Cameron.

30
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,590
I'm skinny. How do you know her name?

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,240
I was a patient of yours.

32
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,600
Oh, well, if you want to leave the chocolates downstairs--

33
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,470
Stay!

34
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,990
Stay away from him.

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,940
Shocking, isn't it?

36
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,690
Who'd want to hurt you?

37
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,090
You're pathetic.

38
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,180
Judging by the growth,

39
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,320
I'd say I've been unconscious for two days.

40
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,010
Have you been sitting there the whole time?

41
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,850
No.

42
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,670
Judging by the oily buildup in your hair,

43
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,850
I'd say you're lying.

44
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,600
I was scared.

45
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,150
Pardon me for caring.

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,710
Did I lose any organs?

47
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,480
The bullet to your abdomen pierced your stomach,

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,340
nicked the bowel, lodged in the posterior rib.

49
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,160
Well, I always say, if you're gonna get shot,

50
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,770
do it in a hospital.

51
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,570
The one in your neck--

52
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,470
I don't remember that one.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,460
Went right through, severed your jugular.

54
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,120
The shooter turns out to be a guy--

55
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,210
don't care.

56
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,810
You don't care why a guy walked into a hospital and shot a doctor?

57
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,960
Shot you?

58
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,400
I assume his reasoning was faulty.

59
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,510
So what was it?

60
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,520
Infection?

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
The surgery went fine.

62
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,870
You've had no post-op--

63
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,530
not me. Patient.

64
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,440
Harpo.

65
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,610
You just got shot, House. You should rest.

66
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,310
I got shot. Diagnostically boring.

67
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,180
Big fat tongue, on the other hand... endlessly entertaining.

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,730
We biopsied his tongue.

69
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,910
and it was negative.

70
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,420
And the blood tests were negative.

71
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,250
I didn't say we did blood tests.

72
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,870
You don't biopsy a tongue unless you have to biopsy a tongue.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,320
And you don't have to biopsy a tongue

74
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,880
unless you've already come up with nothing on a routine battery of tests

75
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,380
which don't involve torturing your patient.

76
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,710
Any new symptoms?

77
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,870
Other than the increased intracranial pressure?

78
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,690
Any guesses on how I figured that one out?

79
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,630
You knew the next step would be a lumbar puncture.

80
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,160
A lumbar puncture would almost certainly give us a definitive answer.

81
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,810
Since we don't have a definitive answer,

82
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,150
we must not have done an LP,

83
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,820
and the most common reason to not do an LP

84
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,040
is increased intracranial pressure.

85
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,620
He was shot by security trying to--

86
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,330
House, what are you--

87
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,110
House.

88
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm talking to Cuddy.

89
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,850
Lie down.

90
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,300
You've got to be in pain.

91
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,780
Not today.

92
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,720
Today I'm on morphine.

93
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,530
You're going to rip your stitches out.

94
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,990
Check Harpo's trash.

95
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,300
Forget about the patient.

96
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,450
Come on.

97
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,280
You're curious.

98
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,720
Trash?

99
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,020
You don't know what I'm talking about

100
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,120
but you know it's good.

101
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,790
You can't just be walking around.

102
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,850
Well, then stop me.

103
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,400
You've lost blood-- - physically stop me.

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,940
- You could damage—
- You can’t.

105
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,900
Because that would involve physically touching me,

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,720
and then things would t so sexually charged--

107
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,090
I'm twice your size.

108
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,880
Get your hands off me.

109
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,930
Everything that lives, eats.

110
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,000
Everything that eats, poops.

111
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
That's why every organ has a sanitation department.

112
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,850
The lymph system.

113
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,470
Whatever's doing the damage is dumping its waste in there.

114
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,960
That's what you meant by trash.

115
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,090
Biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.

116
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,510
I'm sorry, I know it's crazy, but there's no other place.

117
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,280
It's the ICU.

118
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,550
It stands for intensive care.

119
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,300
He needs intensive care, so do you.

120
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,660
He needs to be shot again.

121
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,300
He is handcuffed to his bed.

122
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,150
He is sedated.

123
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:50,940
He's not going to hurt you.

124
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,580
If your security was any good,

125
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,190
I wouldn't have been shot in the first place.

126
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,090
He is where he's supposed to be.

127
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,080
Where you're supposed to be-- - who did my surgery?

128
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,870
Gillick, why?

129
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,530
You going to send him a fruit basket?

130
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,320
He screwed up.

131
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,740
It's annoying enough dealing with your vicodin habit.

132
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,650
Quit upping your morphine.

133
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,040
I'm not.

134
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,700
I'm reducing it.

135
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,200
And you're not in pain?

136
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,490
I'm feeling better.

137
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,430
Gillick is very good.

138
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,460
Your recovery time--

139
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,220
my stomach kills me,

140
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,000
my neck is throbbing,

141
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,150
but my leg feels better.

142
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,240
That's amazing.

143
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,610
It's unbelievable.

144
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,450
Since getting shot is not an FDA approved treatment for anything,

145
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,100
it means something must have gone wrong in the surgery.

146
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,400
Yes, terribly...tragically wrong.

147
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,360
Enjoy the mistake.

148
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,800
He must have nicked something in my peripheral nervous system.

149
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,030
If it's alleviating pain, who knows what else it's doing?

150
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,550
Get back to the ICU

151
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,180
before you rip out your stitches,

152
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,330
and I have to chain you to your bed.

153
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,730
Why did you try to kill me?

154
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,910
I didn’t.

155
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,010
Then the gun thing might have been a mistake.

156
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,260
If I'd have killed you, it would have been over.

157
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,990
I needed you to live.

158
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,400
Because I want to see you suffer.

159
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,690
Get the needle out of there.

160
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,120
He can't breathe.

161
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
House.

162
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,160
The test was negative.

163
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,670
Are you sure you want to be doing this?

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm fine.

165
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,710
I think

166
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,400
Cameron, you got my records?

167
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,510
They don't like to release patient's operative notes.

168
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,170
And yet you're holding them.

169
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,200
And whispering.

170
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,910
He's sleeping.

171
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,140
Yeah.

172
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,430
Killer needs his rest.

173
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,590
Otherwise. he's grumpy all day.

174
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,610
Hey! Wake up.

175
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,760
Watch me save a life

176
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,030
almost for sure it's some sort of infection.

177
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,800
We've got him on broad spectrum antibiotics,

178
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,470
but it's not even slowing the thing down.

179
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,230
Unless we figure out what type of infection,

180
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,090
we can't treat,

181
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,130
and we can't figure out what type

182
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,580
because we can't do an LP.

183
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,450
Do an LP.

184
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,810
See what I did there?

185
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,220
Couldn't have done that if you'd killed me.

186
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,780
We would have done an LP two days ago if we could have.

187
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,650
But that much pressure,

188
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,580
something's bound to go-- - we would have done an LP two days ago

189
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,410
if the risks hadn't so obviously outweighed the benefits.

190
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,220
We just cut a hole in his throat.

191
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,910
The equation has changed.

192
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,950
Couldn't have put it better myself.

193
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,800
pressure...

194
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,570
120 millimeters H2O,

195
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,550
with small visible excursions related to respiration and pulse.

196
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,230
Well within normal, that's good.

197
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,080
No, that's weird.

198
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,410
You want to hear a story?

199
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,480
I have a rule.

200
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,170
People who shoot me forfeit the right--

201
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,540
my wife was sick.

202
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,930
None of the doctors could figure out why.

203
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,330
Oh, I know this story.

204
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,760
She died.

205
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,520
So you selected one of her doctors to kill,

206
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,890
because that would make everything right again.

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,450
She lived.

208
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,300
You cured her.

209
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,930
I'm truly sorry I did that.

210
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,150
In the course of investigating her illness,

211
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,420
you convinced me that everything was relevant.

212
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,840
You needed the truth.

213
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,210
I confessed to you that I'd had an affair.

214
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,050
But it turns out that it had nothing to do with why she was sick.

215
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,020
Genetic predisposition to brain aneurysms.

216
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,580
You told her that.

217
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,240
You also told her about my affair.

218
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,350
And you caught crap,

219
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,800
she left you,

220
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,520
and now I've got to pay

221
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,640
because you couldn't keep your little killer in your pants.

222
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,380
She killed herself.

223
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,740
What sort of hospital has glass walls?

224
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,700
That's my husband.

225
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,420
Really?

226
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,400
You thought I just liked watching people get needles poked in the back?

227
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,750
Nope.

228
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,760
I figured a coworker or a sister.

229
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,980
Not wife.

230
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,020
Why?

231
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,120
Don't worry. It's not insulting.

232
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,430
At least not to you.

233
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,440
You're satisfied by that answer?

234
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,540
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

235
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,080
You're not going to shoot me, are you?

236
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,220
You treated a friend of mine.

237
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,020
She told me you only talk to people if you have to.

238
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,390
And then you insult them while showing off how insightful you are.

239
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,310
Sevens marry sevens.

240
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,670
Nines marry nines.

241
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,480
Fours marry fours.

242
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,180
Maybe there's some wiggle room if there's enough money,

243
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,230
or somebody got pregnant.

244
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,230
But you've got at least three points on your husband,

245
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,490
and your frock says you didn't do it for the money.

246
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,070
And your breasts say that you haven't had any kids.

247
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,190
So you figure my marriage is a mathematical error?

248
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,820
Numbers don't lie.

249
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,850
We're having trouble finding out what infection your husband has.

250
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,640
The most likely culprit is an std.

251
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,100
You want to know if I've had an affair with someone closer to my integer.

252
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,960
And I have to tell you the truth, or my husband will die.

253
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,810
Is your friend single?

254
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,310
No.

255
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,340
And I've always been faithful.

256
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,780
wow.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,330
I would've bet money something would go wrong.

258
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,010
Let's rotate him back.

259
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,330
he's bleeding into his ocular orbit.

260
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
LP wouldn't do this.

261
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,890
Lots of pressure behind.

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,260
Gotta relieve it.

263
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,520
What's going on? What-- what are they doing?

264
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,170
I should go.

265
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,050
I seem to have torn my stitches.

266
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,800
You collapsed in the hall.

267
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,470
Tore your stitches.

268
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,230
I remember. I was there.

269
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,920
How's your gut? It's hurting?

270
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,160
You shoot the guy who sold her the gun?

271
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,300
She locked herself in the garage,

272
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,320
and she started the car.

273
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,820
You shoot the guy who sold her the garage door opener?

274
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,530
You're an ass.

275
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,780
That is a bold position to take, given that I shot you.

276
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,890
The shooting just makes you an idiot.

277
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,880
You're an ass because you're trying to wrap it in the flag,

278
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,060
like you did a good thing.

279
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,790
You're an ass and a hypocrite.

280
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,980
You don't believe in rules.

281
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,560
You do whatever you think is right.

282
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,980
That's all I did.

283
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,360
You were my role model.

284
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,640
Watch out. You’re getting crumbs on the flag.

285
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,920
I didn't commit to honor her.

286
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,670
I didn't commit to never lie to her.

287
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,160
Well, if you'd kept your mouth shut,

288
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,680
she'd be alive, and you wouldn't be shot.

289
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,550
If you'd kept your pistols in your pants--

290
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,730
it's my fault she's dead.

291
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,510
I know it.

292
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,740
But why can't you admit

293
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,560
that it's maybe just a little bit yours too?

294
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,610
That maybe it's not just medical mistakes that screw things up.

295
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,950
Here's how life works.

296
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,380
You either get to ask for an apology,

297
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,360
or you get to shoot people.

298
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,040
Not both.

299
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,250
infections don't make your eyes pop out.

300
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,300
we should get back.

301
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,680
You're supposed to be chained to your bed.

302
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,950
I'm not done eating.

303
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,820
There's got to be some sort of bleeding disorder.

304
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,540
This is really stupid.

305
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,430
Look, if my stitches pop out again,

306
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,480
I got three doctors to save me.

307
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,900
Could be some sort of weakness in the lining of the ocular veins.

308
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,290
Okay, I’ll be you guys.

309
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,930
No way, mate.

310
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,000
Too much blood to just be a vein.

311
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,150
No way, hizzie.

312
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,260
If it was an artery, he'd still be bleeding.

313
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,310
Actually, he'd be dead.

314
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,150
He could have had a granuloma in his sinuses that bled,

315
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,900
which could have been caused by Wegener’s.

316
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,600
I think the surgeon would have noticed a giant growth
while they were sticking the eyeball back in.

317
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,270
Tongue and eyes are sick.

318
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,360
What about the nose?

319
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,680
It's right in between. Why isn't it sick?

320
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,880
So it's not spreading. It's got a common source.

321
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,470
Which can only be what?

322
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,040
The brain, except the ct was clean.

323
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,780
Check the brain's trash, see what it's hiding.

324
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,160
The brain doesn't have a lymph system.

325
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,010
I know.

326
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,490
All its garbage just blows off,

327
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,540
gets caught in the snow fence by the side of the road.

328
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,930
You're referring to the blood-brain barrier.

329
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,620
What else?

330
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,770
Biopsy the barrier.

331
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,510
Wouldn't it be safer to make a few educated guesses first?

332
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,540
Try some relatively safe treatments?

333
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,690
Biopsy the barrier.

334
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,890
But first, start him on mebendazole in case it's a worm.

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,490
And levofloxacin in case it's an infection that slipped by the first antibiotic.

336
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,840
And azithromycin for stds.

337
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,760
I really don't think the wife is the kind to be messing around.

338
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,580
If I was married to her, I certainly wouldn't--

339
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,610
House.

340
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,890
The patient isn't married. He's a widower.

341
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,950
Really, it's more helpful if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.

342
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,720
My body is fine.

343
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,720
My mind, on the other hand...

344
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,350
maybe she was a girlfriend.

345
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,570
Maybe she was just trying to jerk you around.

346
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,720
I spoke to every one of the nurses on that floor.

347
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,380
The patient had only had six visitors.

348
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,790
Two females, no babes.

349
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,970
His mother and his aunt.

350
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,140
So they missed someone.

351
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,150
They're not security.

352
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,670
My posse never saw her or me talking on the other side of the glass.

353
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,610
They were a little busy trying to save the guy's life.

354
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,720
There's on one possible conclusion.

355
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,250
It was a hallucination.

356
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,560
What does that look like to you?

357
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,880
Point-six?

358
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,330
Anesthesia?

359
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,060
No.

360
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,850
It's got to be six and a smudge.

361
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,030
Let's say you’ eight.

362
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,020
It wouldn't be that uncommon after trauma.

363
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,200
After that much blood loss?

364
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,630
If my perceptions are compromised,

365
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,780
then my judgment is compromised.

366
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,780
What if his wife told me

367
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,110
that the patient just got bit by a rabid Vietnamese leper?

368
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,950
So pull yourself off the case.

369
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,050
And the next case?

370
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,310
You take two weeks.

371
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,710
You recover.

372
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,970
What if I don't?

373
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,890
What if it wasn't the shooting?

374
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,820
The guy who sees connections between everything

375
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,440
sees no connection between being shot and minor brain disruptions?

376
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,700
What if it was the surgery?

377
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,070
What if it was the fact that you tore out your stitches and lost two pints of blood?

378
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,650
Why did Gillick give me ketamine during my surgery?

379
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,380
Working.

380
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,100
We need to talk.

381
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,050
Get back to the ICU. Who un-cuffed you?

382
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,960
Why would a surgeon administer ketamine?

383
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,110
Who showed you your surgical file?

384
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,070
How do you know it's mine?

385
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,700
Because your patient hasn't had surgery,

386
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,280
and you don't care about anybody else.

387
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,370
My anesthesia was almost nonexistent,

388
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,730
and yet I wasn't awake.

389
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,800
For some reason,

390
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,400
somebody decided to put me in a dissociative coma

391
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,990
instead of just putting me out.

392
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,350
There are plenty of reasons to use--

393
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:30,950
fine.

394
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,580
I'll go beat the truth out of my surgeon.

395
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,840
Gillick, right?

396
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,970
It worked.

397
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,290
There's a clinic in Germany.

398
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,930
They've been treating chronic pain by inducing comas,

399
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,210
and letting the mind basically reboot itself.

400
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,400
There's about a 50% chance your pain will come back.

401
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,290
Which of course means there is a 50% chance that it won’t.

402
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,680
You had no right--

403
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,090
to heal you?

404
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,420
You messed with my brain.

405
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,040
Why are you so upset?

406
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,470
Are you experiencing any neurological symptoms?

407
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,020
Dizziness, tremors, hallucinations?

408
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,940
No.

409
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,410
It's a point of principle.

410
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,900
Test was negative.

411
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,360
No trash against the fence.

412
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,630
Is your leg really better?

413
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,790
Don't worry, I’m sure something else is wrong.

414
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,180
We did find blood.

415
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,750
On which side?

416
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,730
The wrong side.

417
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,160
First thing that makes sense.

418
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,450
The wrong side's the wrong side.

419
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,470
It can't make sense.

420
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,640
It'd mess with his brain.

421
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,290
Wouldn't cause fever.

422
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,160
He's been sleeping a lot lately.

423
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,720
You worried?

424
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,650
I marked a change of meds on his chart.

425
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,220
Foreign object.

426
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,440
Body wants to get rid of it.

427
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,650
It causes the fever.

428
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,830
Blood's a foreign object?

429
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,360
in the brain lining, it is.

430
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,900
Blood dyscrasia means cancer.

431
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,800
Find it.

432
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,550
All the tests-- - have been negative.

433
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,580
What do you do if your trash cans are full?

434
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,310
You use your neighbors' trash cans.

435
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,300
Except it's still light outside.

436
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,720
Your neighbor will see you.

437
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,560
So you go out the back way, into an alley,

438
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,480
and drop off your trash by their garage.

439
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,590
We'll check the lymphatic system in the chest.

440
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,960
You got that from trash cans in the alley?

441
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,610
The saliva glands from the tongue

442
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,090
are connected to the lymphatic system in the lungs.

443
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,900
It's the next lymphatic system over.

444
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,700
Yeah.

445
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,160
Go get lung lymph.

446
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,230
How did he know that?

447
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,620
I wouldn't have hired him if he wasn't smart.

448
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,070
Right.

449
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,390
Because you have nothing but respect for him.

450
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,950
Maybe he knew the answer

451
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,780
because the question

452
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,960
wasn't nearly as tricky as you thought.

453
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,230
Maybe he's not getting smarter.

454
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,260
You're getting dumber.

455
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,160
You pretend to buck the system.

456
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,500
Pretend to be a rebel.

457
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,430
You claim to hate rules.

458
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,070
But all you do is substitute your own rules for society’s.

459
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,340
And it's a nice, simple rule.

460
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,880
Tell the blunt, honest truth

461
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,230
in the starkest, darkest way.

462
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,680
And what will be will be.

463
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,310
What will be should be.

464
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,360
And everyone else is a coward.

465
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,730
But you're wrong.

466
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,580
It's not cowardly to not call someone an idiot.

467
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,550
People aren't tactful or polite just because it's nice.

468
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:23,420
They do it because they've got an ounce of humility.

469
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,820
Because they know that they will make mistakes,

470
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,390
and they know that their actions have consequences.

471
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:40,450
And they know that those consequences are their fault.

472
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,060
Why do you want so bad not to be human, House?

473
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,250
Oh, he's awake.

474
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,880
House, we need to talk to you.

475
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,860
How the hell did you know I was awake?

476
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,980
Your nostrils flare when you sleep.

477
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,240
No, they do not.

478
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,550
Fine, I’m lying.

479
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,140
Test was negative.

480
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,790
You knew?

481
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,820
Force of habit.

482
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,700
showed no cancer.

483
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,540
No reason why he's got a fever of 103,

484
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,390
and no reason why his tongue won't fit in his mouth.

485
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,640
He's post-op. Chase is getting him up and around.

486
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,570
It's important that you're up ASAP after surgery.

487
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,610
You think you can urinate?

488
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,910
It's getting bigger!

489
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,860
What, you're...

490
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,390
getting aroused?

491
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,260
No! Not that part.

492
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,620
Oh, god, it hurts.

493
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,000
It's not stopping.

494
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,340
surgeons found no evidence of a burst artery.

495
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,860
The blood had to come from somewhere.

496
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,850
You took a shower in it.

497
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,340
Trauma?

498
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,700
You think someone snuck in here just to kick him in the jewels?

499
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,500
And poke out his eye, and swell up his tongue?

500
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,950
Keep riding.

501
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,100
I got a bet with my physio that I can do 100 klicks by Friday.

502
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,550
What about blood from the kidneys?

503
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,090
Kidneys drain into the bladder, which drains into the ureter.

504
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,400
There's no way it would mess with the scrotum.

505
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,510
Yeah.

506
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,080
Basic human anatomy.

507
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,810
Therefore, I think it's safe to assume that the problem lies elsewhere.

508
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,250
But given that this case doesn't make any kind of sense whatsoever,

509
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,580
maybe we should even question the basics.

510
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,990
Maybe he's not human.

511
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,600
an anatomical defect would seem more likely, but let's not rule that one out.

512
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,430
Even more likely, he is human,

513
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,860
his anatomy is where it's supposed to be, but he has testicular cancer.

514
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,590
we tested for cancer.

515
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,450
we tested the lymph system in his chest.

516
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,660
surgeons found no growth.

517
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,600
surgeons were just trying to put everything back where it was.

518
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,120
They weren't doing an inventory.

519
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,760
May have been lucky.

520
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,420
If you don't catch testicular cancer early, it kills.

521
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,250
Probably eroded some vessel.

522
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,360
Yeah, I know.

523
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,930
The question is why I didn't think of it.

524
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,070
Eyes popping out is a rather odd presentation.

525
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,650
Sack blowing up, on the other hand...

526
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,810
if you could think of everything yourself, you wouldn't need a team to annoy.

527
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,950
I screwed up some basic anatomy.

528
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,150
And I missed connecting a testicular explosion with a testicular problem.

529
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,400
You think there's any way I would have done that before Cuddy messed with my brain?

530
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,650
She was trying to help you, and it worked.

531
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,470
Yeah, I can run like the wind,

532
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,860
but I can't think.

533
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,740
And seeing as how I’m too old to become a professional athlete,

534
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,590
it looks to me as if she screwed me over big time.

535
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,420
You don't want a healthy leg.

536
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,060
Oh, here we go.

537
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,000
If you've got a good life, if you're healthy,

538
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,110
you've got no reason to bitch. No reason to hate life.

539
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,560
Here's the flaw in your argument.

540
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,660
If I enjoy hating life, I don't hate life. I enjoy it.

541
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,850
I didn't say it was rational.

542
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,010
HIV testing is 99% accurate,

543
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,810
which means there are some people who test positive

544
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,350
who live with their own impending doom for months,

545
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,590
or years, before finding out everything's okay.

546
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,710
Weirdly, most of them don't react with happiness. Or even anger.

547
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,550
They get depressed.

548
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,780
Not because they wanted to die,

549
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,560
but because they've defined themselves by their disease.

550
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,470
Suddenly, what made them them isn't real.

551
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,690
I don't define myself by my leg.

552
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,710
No, you have taken it one step further.

553
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,590
The only way you could come to terms with your disability

554
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,340
was to somehow make it mean nothing.

555
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,730
So you had to redefine everything.

556
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,320
You have dismissed anything physical.

557
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,900
Anything not coldly, calculatingly intellectual.

558
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,820
Why are you protecting her?

559
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,330
Because she's done nothing wrong.

560
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,400
You're completely comfortable with what she did to me?

561
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,030
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

562
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,390
You agonize over moral choices.

563
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,810
You're not completely comfortable with anything

564
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,990
until you've taken days to get your head around every possible side.

565
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,360
I've known what she did for six hours.

566
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,480
How come you're acting like you've known for days?

567
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,950
What do I have?

568
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,790
You're not sick.

569
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,930
What do I have?

570
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,190
You need to calm down.

571
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,870
I have my brain! And that's it!

572
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,050
We were trying to help you.

573
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,140
Yeah, nobody tries to screw up! They just do.

574
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,730
You were out of control. You were shooting morphine--

575
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,610
I can make people better!

576
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,460
And you two decide to trade that for jogging shoots.

577
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
If you're suffering from side effects, then we can look at that--

578
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,910
you value the physical so much.

579
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,050
Let me put this in terms you can understand.

580
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,950
You're unbelievable.

581
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,680
Even when you're out of your mind with anger and fear,

582
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,010
you still couch it in logical terms.

583
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,480
Are you hallucinating?

584
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,810
Yeah, I’m hallucinating!

585
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,750
No, I mean right now.

586
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,020
Are you hallucinating?

587
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,380
How did you know I was...

588
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,000
you were yelling at me.

589
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,350
You were calling me Wilson.

590
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,670
No.

591
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,340
You're losing it, House.

592
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,780
I never call Wilson by his name.

593
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,740
Oh, yeah, right.

594
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,170
The hallucinator is going to tell the hallucinatee what happened.

595
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,650
You're not the hallucinatee. Wilson was the hallucinatee.

596
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,550
You think maybe you're focusing on the wrong thing here?

597
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,490
Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee.

598
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,500
The bathroom was the hallucinatee.

599
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,830
Bathroom. It figures.

600
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,430
What figures?

601
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,000
You wet your bed.

602
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,750
Damn it.

603
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,200
Test was negative.

604
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,270
No.

605
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,260
AFP and beta HCG say no testicular cancer.

606
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,190
So, let's recap. We’ve just ruled out everything.

607
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,160
Which doesn't make sense.

608
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,710
So the answer has to be something that doesn't make sense.

609
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,360
Do a cystoscopy. Make sure he's human.

610
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,820
Test was negative.

611
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,420
For him being human?

612
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,270
Everything was right where it's supposed to be.

613
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,180
All the tubes go where they're supposed to go.

614
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,710
Most likely scenario is some kind of bacterial prostatitis.

615
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,470
Find out if his father hunche

616
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,370
his father have trouble peeing?

617
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,910
His father have sex with his own mother?

618
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,470
If the answers to any of these questions is yes, assume you're right.

619
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,300
If the answers are no,

620
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,040
assume you're right, but biopsy some prostate lymphs just to be sure.

621
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,900
But...

622
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,250
then we'd have to cut through his stomach.

623
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,180
And since he's clearly got a bleeding problem, this kind of surgery might--

624
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,400
he doesn't clearly have anything.

625
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,120
How did I get here?

626
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,100
What are you talking about?

627
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,260
I was in the ICU.

628
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,000
And then I was coming down these stairs with you guys.

629
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,370
What happened in between?

630
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,310
I don't remember how I got here.

631
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,930
I'm taking myself off my case.

632
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,050
Your patient's in critical care. He’s had a fever unabated for two--

633
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,270
I'm losing my mind.

634
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,950
I'm having blackouts.

635
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,900
You said you weren't having any--

636
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,170
I lied.

637
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,110
If you are doing this to scare me, you made your point.

638
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,020
Next time you get shot, I promise to only treat the bullet wounds.

639
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm off the case.

640
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,450
Why did you jump up when I came in?

641
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,350
I thought you were going to attack me again.

642
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,590
Again?

643
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,600
Yeah, you were in my face.

644
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,220
You were-- -- no, I wasn’t.

645
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,860
You came in here with Wilson and--

646
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,040
that was a hallucination.

647
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,280
No, you--

648
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,700
which means this is a hallucination.

649
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,510
how can I tell what's real and what's not?

650
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,030
Everything looks the same.

651
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,050
Sounds the same.

652
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,900
Tastes the same.

653
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,590
Seems like I'd be the last person you'd want to ask.

654
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,100
Why not?

655
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,980
You're obviously not here.

656
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,720
I'm obviously not here.

657
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,620
Which means this is a creation of my mind,

658
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,860
which means I'm really just asking myself.

659
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,860
Well, if you're talking to yourself, that's a lot of unnecessary explanation.

660
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,910
Hey, I’m trying to work this out.

661
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That requires give and take, even in my own mind.

662
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,760
What was the question?

663
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,260
How can I tell what's real?

664
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,960
Does it matter?

665
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,510
That doesn't sound like something I'd ask.

666
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,230
All right.

667
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:12,760
Your concern is at if you act in the real world based on information that's not real,

668
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,850
the results are impossible to foresee.

669
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,800
With you so far.

670
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,370
But information is incapable of harm in and of itself.

671
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,260
Ideas are neither good nor bad,

672
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,140
but merely as useful as what we do with them.

673
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,400
Only actions can cause harm.

674
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,850
That sounds like me.

675
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,540
So you do nothing.

676
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,510
You refrain from taking any actions.

677
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,360
Continue to throw out your ideas as you always would,

678
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,750
but if they're based on faulty assumptions,

679
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,200
your team will point that out.

680
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,950
They won't do anything that could hurt him.

681
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,600
So I trust my team.

682
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,530
Test was negative.

683
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,810
No blood in the prostate.

684
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,370
No structural abnormalities.

685
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,530
If something doesn't make sense,

686
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,520
what does that mean?

687
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,990
It's not rhetorical.

688
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,650
I need your input on everything I ask, no matter how obvious it might seem.

689
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,470
It means you're wrong.

690
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,680
It means one of your assumptions is wrong.

691
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,700
Because if something doesn't make sense, it can't be real.

692
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,260
So, what are our assumptions?

693
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,570
We don't have any. We’re just guessing on testing.

694
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,090
We assume the tests are right.

695
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,660
We've already redone them.

696
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,290
Twice. Let’s go more basic.

697
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,350
What's more basic than the test results?

698
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,860
The tests themselves.

699
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,170
What does a biopsy consist of?

700
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,300
You take a sample.

701
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,020
Define sample.

702
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,050
It's a small representative piece of whatever you think is the problem.

703
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,570
you go down to the shore, you fill a cup of water.

704
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,860
It's got no fish in it.

705
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,140
Does that mean no fish in the ocean?

706
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,480
We can do another biopsy.

707
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,270
We could fill another cup of water. We gotta dive in.

708
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,680
We gotta see what's actually in there.

709
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,580
We can't operate. He’s got a bleeding problem.

710
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,220
We assume he's got a bleeding problem.

711
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,830
Yeah, because he bled from where he wasn't supposed to bleed,

712
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,920
causing parts of his body to blow up.

713
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,120
Assuming that crazy assumption is correct,

714
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,100
if we operate on him, we'll kill him.

715
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,800
What if we could find a way to do this surgery

716
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,150
without giving him more than a paper cut?

717
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:12,280
You want to let a robot operate on me?

718
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,200
The technology is amazing.

719
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,550
It magnifies everything ten times. It’s ten times the accuracy.

720
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,690
No way. I want a person.

721
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,100
A person will be controlling--

722
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,780
people suck.

723
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,030
People have turned you from a guy with a swollen tongue

724
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,340
into a guy with one eye, one ball, and a stapled-on face.

725
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,430
If you want someone to hold you while you cry yourself to sleep at night,

726
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,450
choose warm and soft.

727
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,320
If you want someone to write you a poem,

728
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,410
pick the sensitive loner.

729
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,430
But if all you care about is that something's done right,

730
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,920
pick the guy with the metal head.

731
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,870
No way.

732
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,170
No way, no way.

733
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,090
You gotta see this thing in action before you say no way. Come on.

734
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,460
House. What are you doing?

735
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,820
Nothing.

736
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,730
I'm not doing anything.

737
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,520
Just throwing out ideas.

738
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,740
I think you should put him in a wheelchair, take him down to the O. R.

739
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,800
But I may be out of my mind.

740
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,860
Relax, Cameron.

741
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm not going to cut you.

742
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,110
I just want to show what this puppy can do.

743
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,370
It can make one-millimeter incisions.

744
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,340
You know how small that is?

745
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,750
It's small even in metric.

746
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,620
If I do something that doesn't make sense,

747
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,470
even to you, stop me.

748
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,570
Delicate, no?

749
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,420
House.

750
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,900
Does that hurt?

751
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,330
Seen enough?

752
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,430
No.

753
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,720
That wasn't a question.

754
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,430
You either do this, or you die.

755
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,530
You've wasted your life.

756
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

757
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:47,580
If only I'd spent more time dedicating myself to finding someone worthy to shoot.

758
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,490
If I had killed you, would it have mattered?

759
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,760
Not to me.

760
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,980
Have you got a pen?

761
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,460
You don't care if you live or die?

762
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,640
I care because I live.

763
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,760
I can't care if I'm dead.

764
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,000
I don't want to hear semantics.

765
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,050
You anti-semantic bastard.

766
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,520
Would anybody care that the world lost that wit?

767
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,620
Working here.

768
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,600
That's all right. You don't have to say anything.

769
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,960
Just let me soak into your subconscious.

770
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,830
You think that the only truth that matters

771
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,120
is the truth that can be measured.

772
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,340
Good intentions don't count.

773
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,670
What's in your heart doesn't count.

774
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,000
Caring doesn't count.

775
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,810
But a man's life can be measured

776
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:33,720
by how many tears are shed when he dies.

777
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,280
Just because you can't measure them,

778
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,750
just because you don't want to measure them,

779
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,640
doesn't mean it's not real.

780
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:52,590
That does not make sense.

781
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,390
And even if I'm wrong,

782
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,310
you're still miserable.

783
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,070
Did you really think that your life's purpose

784
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,190
was to sacrifice yourself and get nothing in return?

785
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,030
No.

786
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:15,420
You believe there's no purpose to anything.

787
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,230
Even the lives you save, you dismiss.

788
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:27,220
You turn the one decent thing in your life, and you taint it, strip it of all meaning.

789
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,760
You're miserable for nothing.

790
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,200
I don't know why you'd want to live.

791
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,900
I'm sorry.

792
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,860
I know what's wrong.

793
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,750
House, get out of here. You’re not sterile.

794
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,240
He'll be fine.

795
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,460
great.

796
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,730
What's he got?

797
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:41,260
How come you guys have never tried to yank me off this case?

798
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,180
I'm having hallucinations.

799
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,090
Blackouts.

800
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:49,130
But you're always insane, and you're always right.

801
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,990
I'm almost always eventually right.

802
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,790
You have no way of knowing when "eventually" is.

803
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,330
Every time I've had an epiphany on this one,

804
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,430
you guys were right on board.

805
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,590
No challenges, no need to explain.

806
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,470
No offense, but

807
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,130
either you guys are getting smarter, or I'm getting dumber.

808
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,070
We've worked with you long enough to know--

809
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,810
I know the test results even before you enter the room.

810
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,180
We have identical knowledge.

811
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,930
How is that possible?

812
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:19,790
You're wrong.

813
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,630
If something doesn't make sense,

814
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,020
one of your assumptions has to be wrong.

815
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,100
Because if something doesn't make sense, it can't be real.

816
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,820
But what if the faulty assumption is that it's real?

817
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,760
House, you're losing it.

818
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,530
I've lost it.

819
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,750
Why did you stop me?

820
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,380
Because I think you're going to kill him.

821
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,660
No, you don't think that.

822
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,760
You know it.

823
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,290
Because you're in my head.

824
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,720
As long as the delusion makes sense, my mind lets it go on.

825
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,720
I have to make it not make sense. I have to...

826
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,440
push it past the point where it can trick my mind.

827
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,150
Hey, hey.

828
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,400
If this is a nightmare, you're gonna wake up.

829
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,150
If it's real, you're killing a man.

830
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,470
It's also possible that I may already be dead.

831
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,580
But I don't believe in the after life.

832
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,620
House, go back to your room.

833
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,570
If this is a hallucination, it's a good one.

834
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,060
You're pain free, you can walk--

835
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,590
it's not real. Therefore, it's meaningless.

836
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,450
I want meaning.

837
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,330
Oh, god.

838
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,920
Goodbye.

839
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,980
- He was shot.
- Twice.

840
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,980
Once in the abdomen, once in the neck.

841
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,710
Hello.-- It's going to be okay.

842
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,240
You're gonna be okay.

843
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,300
You don't know nothing.

844
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,760
Tell Cuddy...

845
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,260
I want ketamine.
