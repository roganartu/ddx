1
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:27,868
- What time?
- 4:30.

2
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:31,034
- Why so late?
- Medical test and social studies.

3
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:35,000
- Did you invite Shelby for Saturday?
- No.

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,026
- Do you want me to call her?
- That'd be great,

5
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:39,250
you calling a 12-year-old girl
for a sleep over.

6
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:41,200
- It'll be fine.
- I'll make you a deal.

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,812
I'll call a friend
when you call a friend.

8
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:49,135
- It's your birthday, do as you want.
- Thank you. Bye.

9
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:51,862
Bye.

10
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,996
- What'd you forget?
- Nothing.

11
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:47,975
- Then why'd you came back?
- 'cause I live here.

12
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:50,007
Come one,
you're gonna be late for school.

13
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:52,407
What are you talking about?
It's 4:30.

14
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,252
Are you okay?

15
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:05,765
I...

16
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:11,551
Tired, I guess.

17
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,565
What's wrong?

18
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:30,820
I don't know.

19
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,493
House - Season 5 Episode 6
"Joy"

00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:37,952
TS: Ragbear.com

www.house-fr.com

23
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,859
Great. That's all I need to know.
You're late!

24
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:11,503
Okay, bye.

25
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,970
37-year-old male with
recurrent blackouts.

26
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,836
Tell him to switch from tequila
to bourbon. It worked for me.

27
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:22,054
The three doctors he's already seen
already ruled out drugs and alcohol.

28
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,480
Then it's epilepsy.
Tell him to buy a hockey helmet...

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,467
ET's clean so is the CT.

30
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:29,015
Relax.

31
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,213
Just 'cause you got
approved by an adoption agency

32
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,466
doesn't mean you'll
get approved by the birth mother.

33
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:35,786
You're a single mom.
That puts you somewhere below

34
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:38,268
couples that quitted
in daycare scandals.

35
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:41,516
You're welcome, Dr. House.
It is an interesting case.

36
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:45,173
What time are you
seeing the mom?

37
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,622
You're having
your guy follow me?

38
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,647
I just trash your social value
as a mother

39
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,360
and all I got was a little sarcasm.

40
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,734
It means you don't feel
the need to defend yourself,

41
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:57,625
which means you're not worried
about getting a kid,

42
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:59,822
which means you've
already got one.

43
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,232
We're meeting at 11:00.

44
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:04,778
She's due to deliver
a baby girl in two weeks.

45
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:08,064
I'm sure the mom will be thrilled
to hand her crack baby off to a doctor.

46
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:11,087
- She's not a crack baby.
- No, mother's perfectly healthy,

47
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:13,622
she just had to give up the baby
in order to continue her work

48
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:15,514
on the human genome.

49
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:18,623
She confessed to some past meth use.

50
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,348
What they don't confess to is almost
always more interesting.

51
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,558
This is a mistake.

52
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:25,974
Because a kid you don't know
may have some problem

53
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:28,438
that you don't know about that
she may have passed on to a kid?

54
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:30,356
You're a control-seeking narcicist.

55
00:04:30,518 --> 00:04:32,494
Which is fine,
good even in some jobs.

56
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:36,179
But you're not equipped to handle
a real kid nevermind a factory second.

57
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:38,690
Where are you meeting her?

58
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:41,082
In a little place called "Follow me

59
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:43,882
and your urologist
will be buying himself a new yacht."

60
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:45,937
They explained
the returns policy, right?

61
00:04:46,057 --> 00:04:48,416
- It's worse than video games.
- Not changing my mind.

62
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:55,798
- Could be post-concussion syndrome.
- Not without a preconcussion.

63
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,967
- Pick a number.
- For what?

64
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,081
Cuddy pool. She got the inane.

65
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:01,881
The little tweaker is doing 14 days.

66
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,219
That's great news... I think.

67
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,289
It's good news.
The great news is...

68
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:08,379
she insisted that she's
not gonna change her mind,

69
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:10,615
means she's actually
thought about changing her mind

70
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:12,857
means she's not sure
if she's ready to be a mom,

71
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,610
means she's not ready to be a mom,
means she's gonna change her mind.

72
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:17,299
Only question is when.

73
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,274
$100 buyin'. Less than seven
means the next seven days.

74
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:22,381
But she's been dying
for a kid for three years.

75
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,787
- No way she's gonna back out now.
- Not one of the options.

76
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:31,343
Many strokes can cause
blackouts, memory loss.

77
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:33,711
Nine hours is a lot of time
to be out from a mini-stroke.

78
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:35,672
And there'd be residual damage
on the CT.

79
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,966
Guy works at home as
a consumer product tester.

80
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,843
He could've been exposed to a toxin
that caused short-term memory loss,

81
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:42,396
wouldn't show up on imaging.

82
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:45,954
Cavernous sinus thrombosis could
cause absence seizures and memory loss.

83
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:48,726
- I'll take 7 to 14.
- We have a player.

84
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:51,312
You just said it was great news.
Now you want to bet against her?

85
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:53,593
It's only great news if
she wants it to be great news.

86
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:56,875
House knows her better than any of us.
I'd rather you use a pseudonym.

87
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:58,828
Good thinking.

88
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,180
I say she's gonna
meet the mom and bolt.

89
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm going for the early fold.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,152
Check his home for toxins and
his sinuses for thrombosises.

91
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:14,419
Maybe he Oded on cafeine.

92
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:17,597
Apparently, he didn't drink
the coffee. Just smelled it.

93
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,660
Did they just move here?

94
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,933
- Six years ago.
- This is no way to raise a kid.

95
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:31,712
He's a single dad.
I'm sure he's doing his best.

96
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:35,061
Which is why single
people shouldn't have kids.

97
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:36,960
You got a problem with
what Cuddy's doing?

98
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,426
You think single mothers...

99
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:41,012
I think the traditional
family is a fraud.

100
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:44,776
Even married moms are single moms.
Daddy just pays some bills

101
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:47,888
and reads just enough bedtime stories
to not kill himself out of guilt.

102
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,905
My dad was great.
After my mum died...

103
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,540
He might be the exception.
On the other hand,

104
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,547
you are fairly screwed up.

105
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:05,071
No booze, no meds, no drugs.

106
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,883
And no view.
The building's half empty.

107
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:09,140
He's rather have a view
at the turnpike than the park.

108
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,785
Park views are probably 50% more.

109
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:13,519
Are you surprised the guy's a
pragmatist after looking at this place?

110
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:16,085
Guy's not a pragmatist.
He's a flagellant.

111
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:18,418
Looks like mold.

112
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:32,891
A mom would've, cleaned better.

113
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,086
Exposure to certain types of mold
can cause short-term memory loss.

114
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:40,953
- We're testing both of you.
- I feel fine.

115
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:44,246
I'm sure you are...
We're just being cautious.

116
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:47,760
Where do you guys go
other than home and school?

117
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,405
Nowhere. Dad works
at home and I go to school.

118
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:53,117
What about sports, friends, travel?

119
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:55,895
Like I said, dad works
at home and I go to school.

120
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,275
Must be hard not
having your mom around?

121
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:04,129
I was only 4 when
the accident happened.

122
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:07,584
Still, I'm sure you both
miss her sometimes.

123
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,165
Not really...

124
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:14,497
- You're strong.
- No,

125
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:17,848
I just don't get what the big
deal about death is, you know?

126
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,578
Yeah.

127
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,900
How is she?

128
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,969
Physically, she's fine.

129
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:29,947
Mentally, she's weird.

130
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,255
I'm sure she's just
freaked out about her dad.

131
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,850
Mr. Harmon?

132
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,268
Mr. Harmon.

133
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,021
Where are you going?

134
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,910
I have an appointment. I have to go.

135
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,721
We haven't finished
with your treatment.

136
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:48,048
- We're waiting test results.
- I have an appointment.

137
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:51,576
- You're gonna have to reschedule.
- I really have to go.

138
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:56,414
- Mr. Harmon, do you know where you are?
- Why are you trying to stop me?

139
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,518
His eyes.

140
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:02,920
Is he having a seizure?

141
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:04,994
His pupils are responsive.

142
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,633
I think he's... asleep.

143
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,056
He was just asleep.
Means no memory loss.

144
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:15,933
Sleepwalking doesn't kill.

145
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:18,529
- Unless he walks out a window.
- Sleepwalking's not a diagnosis.

146
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,780
It's a symptom. As long as we
can't figure out why...

147
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,916
Stress-induced insomnia.
Lots of people sleepwalk.

148
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:25,818
Not in the middle of the day before
they've even put their head on a pillow.

149
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,487
- Could be some sort of narcolepsy.
- Which is caused by...

150
00:09:29,097 --> 00:09:30,700
There's usually genetic history.

151
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,700
Or?

152
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,319
If you know the answer,
can you tell us the answer?

153
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:38,680
I don't know the answer.
Which brings us back to... or?

154
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,651
Some sort of environmental trigger.

155
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:42,604
- Which means?
- It's a toxin.

156
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:45,338
- So we are?
- Being lead down an annoying path.

157
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,373
I honestly don't know
where this is going.

158
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:50,357
- Just following the clues.
- We're right back where we started.

159
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:52,486
The mold we found
doesn't cause these symptoms.

160
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,546
And there's nothing else
at his home.

161
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,641
- And?
- And you're obnoxious.

162
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:59,380
- He never goes anywhere else.
- Which we know because?

163
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,099
Because he says so.
Because his daughter says so.

164
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:03,782
Because they have no reason to lie.

165
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:06,600
Which proves he never
goes anywhere else...

166
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,903
When...

167
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,776
He's...

168
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:17,629
Conscious.

169
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:19,201
Oh, my god, you're right.

170
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,958
- He said he had an appointment.
- Next time, let him keep it.

171
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,280
Send him home.

172
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,293
See where his dreams take him.

173
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Becca?

174
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:49,902
- Dr. Cuddy?
- Lisa. Nice to meet you.

175
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:53,103
- Oh, you want one?
- No thanks.

176
00:10:53,223 --> 00:10:56,280
I can't stop eating them.
I guess it's, like, a craving.

177
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,911
I must have, like,
a dozen a day.

178
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,051
Oh, and this is decaf.

179
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,850
How have you been feeling?

180
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:07,073
You know, tired, fat, nervous.

181
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:11,382
Is there anything
you want to ask me?

182
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:14,139
Yeah, actually,
I just have one question.

183
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,673
What are you gonna call her?

184
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:19,932
I'm not sure.

185
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:21,976
It's all been
rather sudden, you know?

186
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:23,300
I like Joy.

187
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,690
But as I said,
I haven't really decided yet.

188
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,501
Well, is there anything
you want to ask me? It's okay.

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,399
The agency web site is filled
with prospective parents.

190
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,161
Their photos, their biographies.

191
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,580
There's so many wonderful people
out there.

192
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,268
Wonderful couples.

193
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,910
Why did I choose
a single mom?

194
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,599
My grandmother was married
for 37 years

195
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,630
to a man that treated her
like garbage.

196
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:53,739
And my mom would've stayed married

197
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,760
to my loser dad that long,
but he dumped her.

198
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,715
You know, I never understood
how you could fall for the same crap

199
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:00,080
as your mother.

200
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,651
Then I met Tony.

201
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:07,012
When I read your bio,
a doctor, a head of a hospital,

202
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,959
I saw your picture...

203
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,335
I don't want her raised by a loser.

204
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,746
How long have you had that rash?

205
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,480
I don't know. A few days?

206
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,263
- Have you had any joint pain?
- Yeah, I'm pregnant.

207
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:30,539
All my joints hurt.

208
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:33,456
They shouldn't all hurt.
Have you been using?

209
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:34,801
Not in seven months.

210
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,717
Not since I found out
I was pregnant.

211
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,293
That needs to be checked out.

212
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:51,152
You sure you don't want children?

213
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,207
You know, just because
we're stuck here and I'm lying down

214
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:57,027
doesn't mean we need to get deep.

215
00:12:57,147 --> 00:13:00,011
You're afraid you'll make the same
mistake you made with your wife.

216
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:02,794
Get caught taking some
other kid to a ball game.

217
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,051
I like my life as it is.

218
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:08,572
- Alpha waves increasing.
- Any change in demeanor?

219
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,292
No, nothing.
He just got up.

220
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:12,953
Maybe it's a result
of the blood pressure change.

221
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:15,673
Delta waves out of nowhere.

222
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,368
He's now asleep.

223
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:22,269
Brain's supposed
to turn off motor function.

224
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:25,399
If the brain was doing what
what he has to do, we wouldn't be here.

225
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,767
He's leaving.
Come on.

226
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,006
She's 38 weeks.

227
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,215
- You think it's fifth disease?
- What's that?

228
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:34,358
It's a viral infection.
It can infect the fetus.

229
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,334
Usually in the first
20 weeks of pregnancy,

230
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:38,498
in women who have trouble
with their immune system.

231
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,901
History of drug abuse could've
compromised her immune system.

232
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,284
I told you I haven't used
anything in seven months.

233
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:45,177
It does look more
like a heat rash to me.

234
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:49,026
Yes, well, maybe we want to look
at the actual blood tests.

235
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:51,059
Of course.

236
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,300
- She work for you?
- Yeah.

237
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:57,047
Everybody here works for you.

238
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,682
When this happens for real,
are you okay to deliver here?

239
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:03,669
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

240
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:06,376
Blood work's normal.

241
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,435
- Test it again.
- Tested it twice.

242
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,396
I'll get you some topical cream
for that rash.

243
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:13,862
I'm admitting her.

244
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,835
- There's nothing wrong.
- There are dozens of other things

245
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:19,199
this rash could indicate.

246
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:20,905
I want a full fetal work up.

247
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:23,980
You're losing it.

248
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,875
That's what happens
when you have kids.

249
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:29,378
Ceaseless crying and nagging
leads to irrational fears.

250
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:32,522
It's impressive that you didn't wait
for the actual crying and nagging.

251
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:35,420
She had a lace pattern rash,
joint pain, and a history of drug abuse.

252
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,338
You would've done
exactly the same thing.

253
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:39,465
And I'd be an excellent father.

254
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:42,343
Hey! What are you doing?!

255
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:43,668
Baby barf.

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,263
Maternity ward was handing out
free samples.

257
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:49,058
Well played, sir.

258
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:51,480
You leave me no choice
but to change.

259
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:54,291
- My clothes, not my mind.
- That's exactly my point.

260
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:56,819
It's not gonna be me and a cup.
It's gonna be eight times a day.

261
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,347
If you can't handle wearing
that stain, you can't handle a baby.

262
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:00,680
Why do you even care?

263
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,808
It's not like I'm ever gonna ask
you to babysit.

264
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:04,257
I'm a humanitarian.

265
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:13,099
- We should stop him.
- The whole point was to...

266
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:15,167
Let him plow
into some innocent bystander?

267
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:17,962
- His legs are working.
- Obviously, his eyes are working too.

268
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:19,816
His reaction time could be slower.

269
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:22,244
- He's stopping.
- Yeah, I see.

270
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,927
He's having sleep sex.

271
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:27,221
Maybe.
Pull up to her.

272
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:28,249
I know.

273
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,635
- What'd that guy want?
- Piss off.

274
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,980
- Go after him. She's not a hooker.
- How do you know?

275
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,692
Do you want me
to describe the clues,

276
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:47,646
or do you want to stop him before
he finishes the drugs he just bought?

277
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,465
Apparently,
rip's a coke fiend.

278
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,599
So sleeping beauty
has a Jones for snow white.

279
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:16,980
Coke explains the narcolepsy.
Narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking.

280
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,399
But it doesn't explain the rip
in the space time continuum.

281
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,428
Coke leads to sleepwalking,
which leads to coke,

282
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,146
which leads to sleepwalking.
What caused the first sleepwalking?

283
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:26,999
The coke he took
while he was wide awake.

284
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:27,871
Says no.

285
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:30,145
Wouldn't be the first time
somebody lied about drug use.

286
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:33,180
He has no reason to lie. He's sick.
His job doesn't drug test.

287
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,234
No relationship.
His daughter wouldn't find out.

288
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:36,624
Maybe he just forgot.

289
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,299
Forgot he did cocaine?

290
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:41,411
You're going with forgot over lying?

291
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:42,700
Fits.

292
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,424
Cocaine explains the narcolepsy.

293
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:47,313
Narcolepsy explains
the sleepwalking.

294
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:50,483
Whatever is in the cocaine other than
the cocaine explains the memory loss.

295
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:52,605
Dealers cut this stuff
with all kinds of garbage.

296
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:55,344
Great, we'll start him on immediate
treatment for all kinds of garbage.

297
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,861
- You can narrow it down in the lab.
- Not without a sample.

298
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,180
So get a sample.

299
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,274
You want us to score cocaine
from a drug dealer?

300
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,318
- It's exciting.
- It's a felony.

301
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:05,653
It's necessary.

302
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,450
There she is.

303
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,452
Amniotic fluid looks good.

304
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,580
Good fetal movement.
Heart's beating nicely.

305
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:26,180
- What?
- It looks like pulmonary hypoplasia.

306
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,514
What's that?

307
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:30,654
The baby's lungs are underdeveloped.
She won't be able to breath on her own.

308
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:32,380
- She might die?
- I don't know.

309
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,641
If She was born, she'd be in trouble,
but, we're not gonna let that happen.

310
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,054
We'll put you on magnesium
to prevent labor and steroids

311
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:39,380
to grow the lungs.

312
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:42,042
It's a good thing
dr. Cuddy brought you in.

313
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,750
How do you know
what a drug dealer looks like?

314
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,695
I'm not doing drugs,
if that's you're asking.

315
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,362
I just noticed that she had cash
in her hand. Obviously came from him.

316
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:54,654
He didn't have enough time
to perform any other services.

317
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,037
- I didn't notice her holding...
- There she is.

318
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:03,800
Uh, we're not cops.

319
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:06,755
- Cops aren't allowed to say that?
- Yeah, they can say it.

320
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,480
But if you were a cop,
you'd know that.

321
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,967
What do you want?

322
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:16,348
I would like to buy
some cocaine, please.

323
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:18,750
Definitely
not a cop.

324
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:26,642
Thank you.

325
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:28,609
Wait.

326
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,727
It's good.

327
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:39,016
- Glad you like it, Pablo. Can we go?
- No.

328
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:41,386
- You gave us the wrong stuff.
- What are you talking about?

329
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:43,554
- You got my best.
- I know. I don't want the good

330
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,267
"get your new
customer hooked" stuff.

331
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:48,018
I want the stepped on "keep the old
ustomer coming back for more" stuff.

332
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,113
- Are you crazy, bitch?
- No, I'm a just a bitch

333
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,867
who knows what she wants.

334
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:59,986
Looks like this kid thing
is really working out for you.

335
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:02,299
All of the shopping,
none of the stretch marks.

336
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,691
Not a good time.

337
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,585
Right, kid's getting worse.

338
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,299
Blessing in disguise.

339
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,109
Although a completely
predictable one.

340
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,180
You take in strays,
don't be surprised by the worms.

341
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,980
- Still wearing the sweater.
- I didn't say you weren't stubborn.

342
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,327
- I said you weren't maternal.
- Thank you. Go away.

343
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,537
- You're getting crankier.
- Baby's sick.

344
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,700
Sorry I'm not finding
the fun in that.

345
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,957
Is it really worth it?

346
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,568
Just for the pursuit
of unconditional love?

347
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,199
Only you could see that
as a bad thing.

348
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,580
It's a fake thing.
There's no unconditional love.

349
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,440
It's just unconditional need.

350
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,054
Don't make this child a victim
of your biological clock.

351
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Victim?

352
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:41,558
You think she's
better off staying...

353
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,538
Yes!

354
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,071
Because at least she knows
she's not qualified for the job.

355
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,069
Let me guess.

356
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:56,532
I'm gonna tell her not to play ball
in the house but she's not gonna listen.

357
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:58,780
No, actually, I was going for

358
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,180
she sneaks her boyfriend in
while you're sleeping,

359
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,994
and he wants to do it on the desk.
And at first she says no,

360
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:06,333
but she has issues
with self-esteem.

361
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,919
- You're gonna pay for that.
- I'm paying for it right now.

362
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,193
With wisdom.

363
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:13,600
Get out.

364
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,154
We found lactose.

365
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,180
The coke was cut
with milk powder.

366
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,546
Makes it nutritious.

367
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,980
Not much of a toxin.

368
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,148
- It is if he's allergic to milk.
- He's not. He has milk in his fridge.

369
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:35,814
- How does he like his coffee?
- I don't know. What does...

370
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,880
What type of cereal's
in the cabinet?

371
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,237
Cocoa-something.
Why, what does it matter?

372
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:42,380
He likes his coffee black.
Milk's for the kid.

373
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,613
- How can you be sure?
- Because if he drank the milk,

374
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,480
he'd know
that he's lactose intolerant.

375
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,680
Ask him, then treat him
for allergic reaction.

376
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,212
If he gets better,

377
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,129
we all get
to go home early.

378
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:56,635
Steroids make you
more prone to infection.

379
00:20:57,114 --> 00:21:00,235
You'll have to stay here for the next
two weeks so we can monitor you.

380
00:21:01,422 --> 00:21:04,933
The baby's lungs, is that
because of... the meth?

381
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,809
Could be.

382
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,220
You must hate me.

383
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:19,107
If you'd done everything
right in your life,

384
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,116
I wouldn't be getting a baby.

385
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,288
You're not scared?

386
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:28,664
I am scared.

387
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:32,501
You got, like, this perfect life.

388
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:35,000
Not yet.

389
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,845
- What's that?
- Heart rate's climbing.

390
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,721
What's wrong with her?

391
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:47,544
It's not the baby.
It's you.

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,982
I need two units
of o-negative, stat!

393
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,155
The mother had a stage two
placental abruption.

394
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:07,663
She's losing blood.

395
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:11,875
So deliver the baby.

396
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:14,235
The lungs are
ten weeks premature.

397
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,189
So deliver now, risk the baby.

398
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,047
Deliver later, risk the mom.

399
00:22:24,674 --> 00:22:26,765
It's not your baby yet.
It's not your call.

400
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,552
She'll do whatever
I tell her to do.

401
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,771
Self-worth issues.
That's genetic, you know.

402
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,360
You should deliver now.

403
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:41,634
Right.

404
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:45,742
Are you serious?

405
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:47,999
You're not?

406
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,414
- You just told me...
- The wrong answer.

407
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,417
You can give the mom more blood.
You can't give the fetus more lungs.

408
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:56,238
The lungs might work.
It's the right decision medically.

409
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:58,005
And yet you're here.

410
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:02,759
To get your opinion,
not to get jerked around.

411
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,128
See, this is what's
screwed up here.

412
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:07,081
You're not sure that this
is the right call,

413
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:09,269
you're sure that this
is what you want to tell her.

414
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,801
And that scares you because
your motives aren't medical.

415
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,985
Some part of you
doesn't want this baby,

416
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:17,899
and that part
wants to tell her to kill it.

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,999
This is an impossible situation.

418
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,560
I'm advising her to take
the safest route.

419
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,867
Right.

420
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,910
Doesn't explain why
you changed your sweater.

421
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,743
I need your advice.

422
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,300
It's not cancer.

423
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,499
Can you remove spleens
with your mind too?

424
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:56,229
You're here to talk about Cuddy.
The file is a pretext.

425
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:58,980
Why the hell haven't you come
to talk to me about Cuddy?

426
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,099
I've been doing all sorts
of insane stuff.

427
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:03,862
If she can't handle your insanity,
she can't handle a baby.

428
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:06,580
- That's exactly my point.
- No, it isn't.

429
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,105
You're feeling threatened
because she's going on to high school

430
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:11,299
and leaving you behind
to repeat the eighth grade.

431
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,872
She's sleeping with the math teacher
to get a diploma.

432
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,560
Adoption is cheating?
Are they giving her a fake kid?

433
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,971
That's the problem.

434
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:19,895
She gets to have a relationship
with a kid,

435
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:21,780
but she can't handle one
with an adult.

436
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,426
So she's gonna kill it.

437
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,493
Well, it does seem cleaner.

438
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,480
I've seen the file.
She's making a judgment call.

439
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,709
Decisions are never made
in a vacuum.

440
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:34,399
Just like your decision
to make her miserable.

441
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:36,556
You're doing this
because we no longer

442
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:38,814
have inkwells and Cuddy
doesn't have pigtails.

443
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,987
Why do you think
I did that?

444
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,745
How you doing?

445
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:56,000
Not sure.

446
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,602
Been keeping an eye
on the clock like you said.

447
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:01,545
- I don't think I lost any time.
- The machinery agrees with you.

448
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:04,061
That means your problems
were caused by the coke.

449
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,675
- Can't believe I did coke.
- You were asleep.

450
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,343
I chose to do coke.

451
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:10,942
In your sleep.
You weren't responsible.

452
00:25:11,062 --> 00:25:13,175
Something inside me wanted to do it.

453
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:15,433
Something inside of me
didn't think it was wrong.

454
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:16,699
It's like a dream.

455
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,380
We all do stuff in our dreams
we wouldn't do when we're awake.

456
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
I don't.

457
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:26,751
What's that?

458
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,835
Did I fall asleep
and hurt myself?

459
00:25:36,323 --> 00:25:38,880
- I don't see any cuts.
- Because there aren't any.

460
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,948
I think...

461
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,353
You're sweating blood.

462
00:25:46,532 --> 00:25:48,700
Guy's bleeding out of his pores.

463
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,768
What does that tell us?

464
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,589
Other than you don't want
to play basketball against him

465
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:54,899
and he's dying?

466
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,999
And neither cocaine
or allergies are the answer.

467
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,980
It's gotta be systemic,
hemmoragic varus.

468
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,280
You think it's ebola?

469
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,148
His white blood cell count would be
through the roof. It's not an infection.

470
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,301
- D.I.C.?
- Coags are normal.

471
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,436
It's cancer.
Leukemia explains everything.

472
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:09,836
- No fever.
- Bleeding.

473
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:11,240
- No weight loss.
- Rash.

474
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,657
- No headache.
- Fatigue.

475
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:14,400
Leukemia'd be obvious from the CBC.

476
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,786
Leukemia has false negatives
all the time.

477
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,080
So we have four reasons
for leukemia,

478
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,980
- four reasons against.
- Only need one against.

479
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,590
Yeah, if we had one reason
for anything else.

480
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:30,751
Go do a bone marrow biopsy.

481
00:26:37,557 --> 00:26:38,900
What would you do?

482
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,400
I think...

483
00:26:44,724 --> 00:26:46,351
I think you should wait.

484
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,750
But if I wait...

485
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:50,779
I could die.

486
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:53,676
There would be
more danger for you, but...

487
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:57,327
Is this your opinion
as a doctor or as a mother?

488
00:26:58,274 --> 00:26:59,835
It's my medical opinion.

489
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,936
- It's my personal opinion...
- I don't want to wait.

490
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,999
It might only be one week.

491
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,835
We will keep you on plasma.

492
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:12,842
This is not my baby.

493
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,303
I have already sacrificed

494
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:18,600
nine months
for this stupid mistake.

495
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,100
I don't... I don't want
to sacrifice any more.

496
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:26,363
Becca, you asked my opinion

497
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:28,559
because you wanted to do
the right thing.

498
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,399
You are giving up this baby

499
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,699
because you don't want
to make the mistakes

500
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,051
your mom made,
her mom made.

501
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:39,180
You have a chance
to break this cycle,

502
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,877
to do something great
for this baby.

503
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,225
No.

504
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:59,367
I need you to hold still.

505
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,151
Wait.

506
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,648
Have you been testing
any tanning creams or sprays?

507
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:10,779
No.

508
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,618
It's not a tan.

509
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:15,835
Means it's not leukemia.

510
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,330
Chem panel confirms
kidney failure, end stage.

511
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,699
Got him on dialysis?

512
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:26,794
- BP's too low.
- Too bad.

513
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:29,880
It would've been nice to have more
than an hour or two to solve this thing.

514
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,980
Hemachromatosis?

515
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,340
- He have tiny testes?
- No. Scleroderma.

516
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,426
His skin's darker, not lighter.

517
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:38,180
As much fun as 20 questions
tends to be,

518
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,380
he's blowing blood
out of every orifice,

519
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,380
- you think it just might be vascular?
- Vasculitis?

520
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,499
If I had said it might be
"vitas gerular,"

521
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:47,780
would you have said
"vitas gerulaitis?"

522
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,480
Test him for vasculitis,
angio and blood.

523
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,780
Even if we're right, he's gonna need
a kidney transplant.

524
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,580
- Test the daughter.
- She's 12.

525
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:57,980
Small kidney. It just means he
won't pee as much.

526
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,324
Great for road trips.

527
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:01,780
I meant she's a minor
and daddy has a conflict,

528
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,620
so we're gonna need Cuddy's signoff.

529
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,599
- So get it.
- She's... kind of busy.

530
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,867
Clamp.

531
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:22,318
Suction.

532
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,993
Entering the abdominal cavity.

533
00:29:29,116 --> 00:29:30,435
There's the head.

534
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:36,653
Got a minute?

535
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:39,072
Get out of here.

536
00:29:39,232 --> 00:29:41,116
- Who's that?
- Dr. Gregory House.

537
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:43,699
He's the one you'll be suing
when you develop sepsis.

538
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:46,496
- Why is he here?
- Better question is why is she here?

539
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,600
You're an administrator.
Administrate.

540
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,822
I have a patient's daughter
needs a guardian ad litem.

541
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:52,994
Tests are inconclusive. But either way
he's gonna...

542
00:29:53,114 --> 00:29:55,213
- House, get out!
- This doesn't need you. I do.

543
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,798
Head's out.

544
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:00,760
- Later.
- Later's too late.

545
00:30:04,608 --> 00:30:06,637
And there she is.

546
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:10,967
Come on, cry.

547
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Come on.

548
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:21,966
Come on.

549
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,784
Joy, cry.

550
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:27,480
Cry, joy.

551
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,837
I'm sorry.

552
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,383
I'm so sorry.

553
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:38,329
That's the sound we like to hear.

554
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,383
Apgar's nine out of ten.

555
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:42,860
You hear that?

556
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,722
You just got your first "a."

557
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:54,325
She's... yours now.

558
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,359
Mazel tov.

559
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,701
Now it's time
to say those magic words

560
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:12,880
you'll be telling her
for the rest of her life.

561
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,501
Mommy's gotta go to work.

562
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,217
Have the risks of the transplant
been explained to you?

563
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,280
Damn it. I was hoping you
weren't going to ask her that.

564
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,680
Of course she knows.
Can you just sign the paperwork?

565
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,559
Dr. House explained to you
that all surgeries carry risk?

566
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,180
- You could die.
- And if you don't do it, dad will die.

567
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,702
Stop pressuring her.

568
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:37,780
Sorry.
Daddy's perfectly healthy.

569
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,896
But we want you to give him a kidney
because it'd be cool if he had three.

570
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,403
Shut up.

571
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,493
Do you understand the risks
of living with one kidney?

572
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:52,230
And you still want to proceed
with the transplant?

573
00:31:57,671 --> 00:31:59,000
Okay, go ahead.

574
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:08,480
I'm saying you can proceed.

575
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:10,056
I'm saying I can't.

576
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:16,300
Whatever he has, she has too.

577
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,600
She's sleepwalking.

578
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,184
If we don't give him a new kidney,
he's dead in a week.

579
00:32:26,304 --> 00:32:27,680
We have to transplant.

580
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,617
When your remote has a dead battery,

581
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:32,200
you don't replace it
with another dead battery.

582
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,080
Whatever's killing the dad's kidneys
is gonna kill the kid's too.

583
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,291
It is possible the sleep issues
aren't medically related.

584
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:42,046
Maybe they're both insomniacs
due to the turnpike noise.

585
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:44,348
Maybe they both drink
too much coffee, maybe...

586
00:32:44,468 --> 00:32:46,484
- House is right.
- How do you know?

587
00:32:46,796 --> 00:32:48,344
Because she's sweating blood.

588
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:51,428
If they have the same thing,
there has to be a common cause.

589
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:54,256
Which means it has to be
a toxin, infection, or genetic.

590
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:56,663
And since we've ruled out
infections and toxins...

591
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:59,280
It narrows it down to any one
of a dozen genic disorders,

592
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,399
each of which takes more
than a week to run.

593
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,193
Call foreman.
Get to work.

594
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,188
Cuddy is positively aglow.

595
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,180
What's your theory? She's only acting
happy to make you miserable?

596
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,900
I need a genetic disease.

597
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,980
I'm sure you're carrying a few.

598
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,780
Symptoms are kidney failure,
bleeding, and insomnia.

599
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,327
You paid off the pool?

600
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,100
Technically, anyone
who didn't enter is a winner.

601
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,463
It's not over yet.

602
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,872
Everyone's happy until they
unwrap that pretty present

603
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,139
and find they got a wall clock
in the shape of africa.

604
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:34,900
Adoption's a cheat, remember?

605
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,780
There's no real pregnancy, so there's
no stranded dopamine receptors,

606
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,813
so there's no postpartum depression.

607
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,567
Cuddy will be the happiest
new mother you've ever seen.

608
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,516
I've just given you
the answer, haven't I?

609
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,800
And now you're going to walk out
of here without saying a word.

610
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Nope!

611
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,334
Good news.

612
00:34:01,803 --> 00:34:03,300
I know what you have,

613
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,509
and you're both gonna be fine.

614
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,554
What? Are you serious?

615
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:10,301
Yes and no.

616
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,200
- So you do know what they have?
- Yeah.

617
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,349
- But they aren't gonna be fine?
- no idea.

618
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
They might be.

619
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,677
Why the hell would you
say they were?

620
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:20,853
To make them happy.

621
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,380
For two seconds?

622
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,774
Technically, to see
if they can be happy.

623
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,897
We should've seen a grin, a twinkle,

624
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:29,780
a sigh of relief, something.

625
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,440
They're sick. They're tired.

626
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,380
They're anhedonic,
incapable of experiencing pleasure.

627
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,577
Something's bushwhacked
their dopamine receptors.

628
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,414
They're depressed.
Mom's dead. Dad's dying.

629
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:42,819
You should know that being bummed
isn't necessarily a pathology.

630
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:45,680
Being bummed doesn't explain
their lack of friends

631
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,360
or their indifference to each other.

632
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,245
Why their place had no music,
no view, no decor.

633
00:34:50,365 --> 00:34:52,501
But if you can't feel pleasure,
what's with the cocaine?

634
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:55,346
Really? Is that why you do drugs?
Because you're happy?

635
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,932
Most people do 'em
because they want to be happy.

636
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,050
His subconscious craved it,
needed it.

637
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,562
Most common cause
of anhedonia is schizophrenia.

638
00:35:02,722 --> 00:35:04,856
- Sure, in white folk.
- They're black?

639
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,026
They're liars.

640
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:13,281
What's your name?

641
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,700
Jerry harmon.

642
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,500
Your real name.

643
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,912
Hosarian?

644
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,371
Herzog?

645
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,800
H'ali-baba?

646
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Hammoud.

647
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:30,882
Jamal hammoud.

648
00:35:31,515 --> 00:35:34,800
Changed it when we
invaded Iraq the first time.

649
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,345
How'd you know?

650
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,600
You and your daughter
have familial mediterranean fever.

651
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,617
It's a genetic disease

652
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:44,632
contracted by people
of Mediterranean descent.

653
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:47,280
Sephardic Jews, Armenians, Arabs.

654
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:50,391
Causes anhedonia,
seizures, kidney failure,

655
00:35:50,511 --> 00:35:51,861
even lactose intolerance.

656
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:54,280
Symptoms are set off
by age and stress.

657
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,580
Kid couldn't get happy, but she
could get stressed by daddy dying.

658
00:35:57,777 --> 00:36:00,980
- You don't know if we'll get better?
- Treatment tends to be hit and miss

659
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,400
once you reach
the sweating blood stage.

660
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:06,590
Start them on colchicine
and melphalan.

661
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,500
His kidneys are fried.

662
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,343
If he doesn't have fmf,
the colchicine will kill him.

663
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:14,133
Boy, sure hope I'm right.

664
00:36:59,187 --> 00:37:00,400
Mr. Harmon?

665
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,141
Mr. Harmon, I need you
to open your eyes.

666
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,581
Feeling better?

667
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,351
How's samantha?

668
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,996
Healthy enough to toss you a kidney.

669
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,990
- Dad?
- Sammy.

670
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:39,600
Labor & delivery

671
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,232
the baby's doing great.

672
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:55,911
I...

673
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,000
I can't imagine how hard
this must be for you.

674
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,480
I was... I was stupid and selfish.

675
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,800
- You were scared.
- Yeah, but you wouldn't have been.

676
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,162
- That's not true.
- I mean, you would've been scared,

677
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,100
but you would've done
the right thing anyway.

678
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,670
And I want to be like that.

679
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,099
I don't...

680
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,055
I don't want to be a loser.

681
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,223
You're not a loser.

682
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,823
When I saw you hold her

683
00:38:31,014 --> 00:38:32,700
and the look on your face,

684
00:38:33,303 --> 00:38:36,300
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

685
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:40,769
And that's

686
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,800
when I realized...

687
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,600
I can't.

688
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Becca.

689
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,885
My life, it's always been about pain,
and anger, and disappointment,

690
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,467
never about love.

691
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,300
And that's when I realized,
you know, it could be.

692
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,800
And I can't give that away.

693
00:39:09,673 --> 00:39:10,810
Becca, don't do this.

694
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,681
What you're feeling is natural.

695
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:28,580
But you're filled with hormones,
and emotion, and fear,

696
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
and...

697
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,077
You just can't make a huge
decision like this right now.

698
00:39:33,197 --> 00:39:34,750
You have to give it some time.

699
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,300
I am...

700
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:38,584
I'm so sorry.

701
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:46,095
It's a decision
that changes everything.

702
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,972
Changes the rest of your life.

703
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,100
I hope so.

704
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:08,675
It's really not
the greatest time for gloating.

705
00:41:16,195 --> 00:41:18,062
There's more
than one baby in the sea.

706
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,127
The world is full of teenage boys
riding bareback.

707
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,905
I'm done.

708
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,792
I can't go through that again.

709
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,361
You're quitting.

710
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:34,150
- Just like you quit IVF.
- Yeah, just like that.

711
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,300
There, you just did it again.

712
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,000
It's too bad.

713
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,100
You would've made a great mother.

714
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,347
You son of a bitch.

715
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:57,600
When I was getting a baby,
you told me I'd suck as a mother.

716
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,637
Now that I've lost it, you tell me
I'd be great as a mother.

717
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:05,155
Why do you need
to negate everything?

718
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,300
I don't know.

719
00:42:40,195 --> 00:42:41,368
Good night.

720
00:42:46,687 --> 00:42:47,773
Good night.

721
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:54,742
Merci  EntaraXia
