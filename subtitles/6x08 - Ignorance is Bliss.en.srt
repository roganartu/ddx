1
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:10,338
I'll be right there.

2
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:11,666
Take your time.

3
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:14,889
You mind if I get a drink of water?

4
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,906
No, not at all. Help yourself.

5
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,573
Not exactly beach reading.

6
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:35,341
Do you understand?

7
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:37,954
Most of these I can get through,
but that one?

8
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:39,594
Can't get past the dust jacket.

9
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,997
- Where's Ted?
- Laid off.

10
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:43,459
Company's going
with per diem workers.

11
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,711
You don't have to pay overtime,
health insurance.

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,614
- That sucks.
- I don't mind. Really, I'm not...

13
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:50,689
a 40-hour-a-week kind of guy.

14
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:55,471
If I could just get you to sign.

15
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:56,421
Right.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,528
Hang on one second.
I want to show you something.

17
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:06,232
You're gonna laugh,

18
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:09,977
but I swear, this guy James Sidas
looks exactly like you.

19
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:13,906
Wait a second.

20
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:18,452
This guy is you.
I saw a profile <i>Nova</i> did on you.

21
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:21,226
You're, like, the youngest guy
to ever graduate MIT?

22
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:24,374
- Standards were lower back then.
- You got an IQ of 178.

23
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,668
Published three books and 35 papers

24
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:28,543
all before the age of 18?

25
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:33,729
Sorry, I really need to get going.
So if I could get you to sign off.

26
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,519
All right. I'll trade you.

27
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,593
I'll sign...
if you'll sign.

28
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:39,514
- I'm not that guy anymore.
- Come on.

29
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,476
This is the most exciting thing
that's happened in this place in years.

30
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:52,689
Come on.

31
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:55,716
Don't be like that.
I'm paying you a compliment.

32
00:01:57,629 --> 00:01:58,929
It's not that...

33
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:01,704
My hand's not working.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,790
You okay?

- $2.32.
- Put it on Dr. Wilson's tab.

41
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:53,255
I don't know who Dr. Wilson is,
and we don't have tabs.

42
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:54,757
Do you know who I am?

43
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,884
Good.

44
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,059
But, sir...

45
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,330
I got it. It's all right.

46
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:03,106
Thanks.

47
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:04,870
Although I should make it clear

48
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:08,280
that for two bucks all you get
is top half, over the clothes.

49
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:10,769
Any plans for turkey day?

50
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,549
Go to my sister's for dinner. Why?

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,843
Just making pleasant conversation.

52
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,880
I've heard tell of folks doing such.

53
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,740
How'bout we talk about this?

54
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:21,033
15-year-old.

55
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,744
- Recurring migraines, blurred vision.
- Great.

56
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,162
- Really?
- Sure.

57
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,141
There's no point in putting
a band together if we don't play.

58
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,500
Hold on.
Take this instead.

59
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:33,379
- I was expecting more resistance.
- That was the old me.

60
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,422
New me is static-guarded
and friction-free.

61
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,149
Enjoy your drumstick.

62
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,432
Ready to save some lives?

63
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:47,643
32-year-old courier.

64
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,022
Ataxia, anemia, mild cough.

65
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,190
- CT was clear. Tox screen negative.
- What're you so excited about?

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,608
Why not?

67
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,778
Got all my starters back,
and a couple of first-class free agents.

68
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,555
I feel like Mike Tomlin.

69
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,376
Probably not as much as you do,
but you get the idea.

70
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,969
Ataxia and anemia could be viral.
Maybe West Nile?

71
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:08,223
No fever, lymph glands were normal.

72
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:10,916
- Anybody seen Wilson?
- Hyperbilirubinemia?

73
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:13,319
Yeah, like that's a real thing.

74
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,800
- Meningitis.
- Anemia's a stretch.

75
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,159
Page Dr. James Wilson at 558.

76
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,642
What about sickle cell?

77
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,306
- Guy's white.
- Whites can get it.

78
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,947
We get the tennis elbow
and all the money.

79
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:25,485
Let them have sickle cell.

80
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,600
- TTP's a better fit.
- He's right.

81
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:34,878
You thought I wouldn't agree with him?
Ever?

82
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,734
You didn't.
That's why he dumped you.

83
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,762
Oh, sorry. It was mutual.

84
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:41,130
We're cool, okay?
Nobody's angry, nobody's hurt.

85
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:42,573
Sounds passionate.

86
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:44,909
- TTP makes sense to me.
- Not to me.

87
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,635
- What if he had a history of...
- One big, happy family.

88
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
TTP it is.

89
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:52,581
Confirm with a blood smear
and adamts13 antibodies.

90
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:55,656
<i>Dr. James Wilson, please dial 558.</i>

91
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,939
- Can you cure it?
- TTP isn't completely curable,

92
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:01,338
but the symptoms are manageable
with the treatment.

93
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:02,675
Is this the treatment?

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
No, first we do a blood test
to confirm it.

95
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:07,723
- But he's gonna get better.
- Honey, that's what she's saying.

96
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:11,227
- I'm gonna be okay. Don't worry.
- How? You're in the hospital.

97
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:12,729
I'm gonna be fine.

98
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,057
You're sure
everything was fine before?

99
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,781
Given your educational background,

100
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:19,043
you'd could at least
find a job with a medical plan.

101
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:20,735
We have money.
Don't worry.

102
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:22,446
It's not that, it's just...

103
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:25,232
I want to make sure we have
all the information we should.

104
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:28,703
- My husband wouldn't lie.
- It's okay. He's just doing his job.

105
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:33,044
He just wants to make sure I'm not
a secret drug addict or an alcoholic.

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,626
Or hiding a history
of mental illness?

107
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,922
I work as a courier
because I want to.

108
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,841
- It's easy. I don't have to think.
- It's too hard to think.

109
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,511
No, just unpleasant.

110
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:48,798
No matter what I did,
it really wasn't good enough.

111
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:49,974
Then I met Dara.

112
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:53,269
She didn't care how smart I was
or what I might accomplish later.

113
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:57,281
It was the first time in my life
that I was really happy.

114
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,641
So I decided
I would rather be happy than smart.

115
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:13,743
You all right?

116
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,668
Sorry. I know you're not okay.
I mean...

117
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,004
She left.

118
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:22,696
Went back to Chicago.

119
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,772
Any chance of reconciliation?

120
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,638
Sure you don't want to grab a drink?

121
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:32,059
We could talk
about the perils of dating doctors.

122
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,873
- I wasn't dating Cameron.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

123
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:37,624
I know what you're doing
and I appreciate it,

124
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:39,749
but I've got it under control.

125
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:41,859
That's what you said
about the Dibala incident.

126
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:43,652
And obviously you didn't.

127
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:47,273
And talking about it
obviously made things so much better.

128
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:55,815
Didn't you think there was
something weird about that guy?

129
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,442
Not really. In fact,
he seemed pretty normal.

130
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,867
That's my point.

131
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,579
Guys with IQs off the chart
are usually completely...

132
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,757
abnormal.

133
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,880
Speaking of House,
why'd you come back?

134
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:11,108
- You must've taken a major pay cut.
- Life's too short to worry about money.

135
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,223
- And your wife?
- She's happy

136
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,895
to cut back on some things...

137
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:16,256
like sex.

138
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,196
- Why'd you come back?
- Why wouldn't I?

139
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,149
Like Foreman said, nobody's angry.

140
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,519
Nobody's hurt.

141
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,053
Schistocytes.

142
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,510
That means TTP.

143
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,072
Which is what we thought it'd be.
Remember? This is a good thing.

144
00:07:30,197 --> 00:07:32,993
This is an easy thing. And House
doesn't take cases that are easy,

145
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,661
which means it's not TTP,

146
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,999
and he wants to see
how long it takes us to catch up to him.

147
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,699
Schistocytes suggest TTP.

148
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:44,574
Good. Now what?

149
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,002
Normally, we'd try plasmapheresis,

150
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,274
but the patient
has an albumin colloid allergy.

151
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,209
So?

152
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,654
So that means we have
to give him a splenectomy.

153
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:53,866
Yes, it does.

154
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,324
- Do you know where he is?
- Not in here.

155
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,520
You're sure you want us
to take out his spleen.

156
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:17,877
Is that what a "splenectomy" is?
I thought it was an ice cream treat.

157
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,149
So you do really think he has TTP?
You're not just testing us.

158
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,424
Yeah, like I have time for games.

159
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:28,215
- So why did you really take this case?
- Isn't it obvious?

160
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:30,175
I'm fishing for a dinner invite.

161
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,854
Missed you
at breakfast this morning.

162
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:44,338
And lunch.

163
00:08:44,777 --> 00:08:46,278
I had a dentist appointment.

164
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:48,592
You know where Cuddy's sister lives?

165
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:51,966
You see, this is why
I don't answer your urgent pages.

166
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:53,842
Because they're not urgent pages.

167
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,817
I've decided what I'm gonna do
about Cuddy and Lucas.

168
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:59,349
- I'm going to break them up.
- Of course.

169
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:02,874
It's given me a purpose in life,
a goal, a <i>raison d'etre</i>.

170
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:07,420
Albeit a selfish,
mean-spirited, childish <i>raison</i>.

171
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:10,017
I think of it more as benevolent.

172
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,646
There's only two outcomes
for their relationship.

173
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:14,871
They split, or they stay
together forever.

174
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:17,431
If it's split, then the sooner
it happens the better for everyone.

175
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:18,935
If it's stay,

176
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:21,145
then my meddling won't matter.

177
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,993
In fact, if they survive it,

178
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,224
it might even make
their bond stronger.

179
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,932
How you manage
to elevate your narcissism

180
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:30,591
to beneficence is masterful.

181
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:34,334
And I've decided
to do a Thanksgiving dinner.

182
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,416
Just 'cause I'm sentimental.

183
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,979
Dinner is at Cuddy's sister's,
which brings us back...

184
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,601
House, don't.

185
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:43,916
I fished for an invite.
Cuddy wasn't biting, I'll have to crash.

186
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,691
I have no idea
where Cuddy's sister lives.

187
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:48,920
Ask and thou shalt receive.

188
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:52,293
You can't honestly think
I would help you with this.

189
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:54,668
Not help me, help Cuddy.
Remember?

190
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:58,931
If you don't get it, I'll be forced
to use more nefarious methods.

191
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:00,356
Happy holidays.

192
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:06,958
Looks great.

193
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:08,808
So he's all better?

194
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,985
Probably be on some long-term meds,
and he's about ten ounces lighter.

195
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,700
Other than that,
won't even know it's gone.

196
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,243
Did you hear that, honey?
You're gonna be just fine.

197
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:22,549
When can I get out of here?

198
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:24,540
Everything checks out,
less than a week.

199
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,459
Good, 'cause those boxes
aren't gonna deliver colors.

200
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,755
- Colors?
- Green...

201
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:33,452
and orange...

202
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:35,509
and ceiling.

203
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:39,388
- Mr. Sidas, do you know where you are?
- Chewing.

204
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:41,848
Shirt...

205
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,205
He's stroking.
Call the cath lab now.

206
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,686
My God.

207
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:51,560
Blood flow's restored.
There appears to be no permanent damage.

208
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,345
Good news is it turns out to be

209
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,946
an exciting, action-packed
thrill ride of a case after all.

210
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:59,199
Bad news is
we took out his spleen for nothing.

211
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,368
Thank God he's still got
his appendix and tonsils.

212
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,288
So what looks like TTP,
acts like TTP,

213
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,895
tests like TTP, but isn't TTP?

214
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,877
CNS vasculitis explains ataxia,
and anemia,

215
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:13,213
- maybe the stroke.
- CT would've picked up something.

216
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:16,506
Hi, I'm Greg House,
a friend of your sister Lisa.

217
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:17,984
Could be DIC.

218
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:19,468
Lisa Cuddy.

219
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,879
Sorry. Wrong number.

220
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:23,415
- You gonna ask?
- He's got a logical explanation.

221
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,525
Can't be DIC.
No hemorrhaging.

222
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,187
And I'm calling all 12 Julia Cuddys
within a 100-mile radius.

223
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,235
See?
Completely reasonable.

224
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,567
- Acquired pancytopenia.
- WBC's normal.

225
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,528
You're...

226
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,195
You're Lisa's sister, right?

227
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,073
You sure?
'Cause you are number 12.

228
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,466
Maybe she got married
and changed her name.

229
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:46,296
- Otis Campbell.
- Probably kept her first name.

230
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:48,736
The mnemonic for toxins.
O for organophosphates,

231
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:52,650
- t for tricyclics, i for insulin.
- Or as I remember it, "moist place".

232
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,327
That's "place" spelled
with two "l"s and a silent "b".

233
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:57,632
- Except the tox screen was negative.
- Standard...

234
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,551
Unstandard toxins
don't show up on it.

235
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,678
You two do an unstandard tox screen,
you two search his home.

236
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:05,421
Otis Campbell's
got to be hiding somewhere.

237
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,782
Smartest guy in the world,
and this is the best he can do.

238
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:13,773
Maybe he's doing what he loves.
Delivering boxes was a childhood dream.

239
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:17,097
Soda, processed cheese,
marshmallow spread.

240
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:19,070
Nothing in here
is capable of going bad.

241
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,006
Ibuprofen, eye drops,

242
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,757
cough syrup.

243
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,217
You want to come over
for Thanksgiving dinner?

244
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:30,451
You never asked me over before.
Why now?

245
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:32,051
I never thought of it.

246
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:34,165
But now that we're both
on the team...

247
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,974
And my wife left me?

248
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:39,728
Is that a bad reason?

249
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:41,793
But I'm okay.

250
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:44,954
On both the food and friends.

251
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Mice.

252
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,261
Leptospirosis could explain
the ataxia and the anemia.

253
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:52,180
But not without a fever.

254
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:54,436
You have someone to talk to?

255
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,191
- Yeah.
- Who?

256
00:12:58,296 --> 00:12:59,825
What, you want names?

257
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,321
Look, you lost a friend.
I get it.

258
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:03,734
But I'm not Kutner.

259
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:06,878
Good, 'cause Kutner never
used to come over for dinner.

260
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:11,331
I'm gonna pretend there's something
interesting over here so you'll shut up.

261
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:24,481
Actually, there is.

262
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,763
He's got sketches
of atomic structure,

263
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,180
This one's full of math proofs.

264
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,339
They're all old.
Nothing since '96.

265
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:37,440
This isn't some homework assignment
his parents forced on him.

266
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,777
This is passion.

267
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,567
Why would he stop?

268
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:44,447
Marriage destroyed his soul.

269
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:00,626
Maybe...

270
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:02,791
it was just the booze.

271
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:09,222
- Thank you, you've been wonderful.
- As have you.

272
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:11,322
- Be well.
- Thank you.

273
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:13,581
You're helping.

274
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:14,806
Voluntarily.

275
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:18,440
- He's done six already.
- Figured you might be backed up.

276
00:14:18,748 --> 00:14:20,358
Holiday season and all.

277
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,486
Which one of us slipped through
the wormhole into another dimension?

278
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,281
I have always loved to travel,
and paint.

279
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:28,109
Lucky number seven.

280
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:30,845
You're trying to be nice,

281
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,565
but I know you have an agenda.

282
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,141
Sexy and smart.

283
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:39,230
- Lucas is a lucky guy.
- The question is,

284
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:42,045
is this a bad agenda or a good one?

285
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:45,545
Either you're trying
to screw with me,

286
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,143
or you're trying to show me
that you've really changed.

287
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:53,294
So which is it?

288
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:54,819
I'm dying to know.

289
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,152
What are you doing for Thanksgiving?

290
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,334
Peace in our time.

291
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,742
Cost me 45 minutes of clinic duty.

292
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:15,455
This is a three-hour drive.

293
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:18,606
Have you considered the possibility
this is a fake address?

294
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,378
She'd send me
to a vacant lot for Thanksgiving?

295
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,630
- If she's smart.
- She is.

296
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,548
I ran it through motor vehicles.

297
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:29,010
- Good as gold.
- This cannot end well.

298
00:15:29,474 --> 00:15:32,555
I don't want it to end well.
You should come as my date.

299
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:35,591
You're not gonna want to miss this.

300
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,526


301
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:40,586
The unstandard tox screen
was as clean as the standard one.

302
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:43,736
But we found vodka
stashed away in his place.

303
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:46,326
What's with the ties?

304
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,364
Makes me look adorably
non-threatening.

305
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:51,724
Party or party hearty?

306
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:53,910
Liver failure
would explain the symptoms.

307
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,622
Party.

308
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:02,089
So, guy's a brainiac,

309
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,462
and his secret drug of choice
is booze?

310
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:08,508
- Kinda pedestrian, don't you think?
- Talk to him, he's a pedestrian guy.

311
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,282
With pedestrian alcoholism.

312
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:12,411
Biopsy can wait
until after Thanksgiving.

313
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:15,835
Assuming the biopsy's gonna tell us
exactly what we expect,

314
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,559
it can wait till after New Year's.

315
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:19,853
On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen

316
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,146
can do it today.

317
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,523
- Why us?
- Juniority.

318
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,966
Welcome back.

319
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,997
- What do you want us to do?
- Same as me.

320
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:29,922
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

321
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,465
I'm not an alcoholic.

322
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,111
You just hide vodka
around the house for fun.

323
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:39,205
I drink, just not a lot.

324
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:41,528
Since when do you drink at all?

325
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:44,461
I have one shot when I get home, baby,
that's it.

326
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:48,048
- So why lie about it?
- Because it's not important.

327
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,594
- What difference does it make?
- That you drink every day by yourself?

328
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,054
I have one lousy drink, okay?

329
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,305
Ever seen me drunk?

330
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,391
You've obviously
been drinking enough to hurt your liver.

331
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,352
- My liver is fine.
- Hold still.

332
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,433
There we go.

333
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,226
This test is a waste of time.

334
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,476
All right. Very good.

335
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:35,559
Here, we got this.

336
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,228
Julia?

337
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:02,103
No, I'm the house sitter.

338
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:04,389
They're in Hawaii for the week.

339
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:15,411
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving, you guys.

340
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:19,999
You must be Dr. House.

341
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:22,770
I was told I should offer you
a turkey sandwich.

342
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:39,898
Tuna salad.
Closest thing they had to turkey.

343
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:42,196
Thanks, but I'm hoping
I can get out of here

344
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,145
to catch the end of dinner
with my wife.

345
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,818
- Anything?
- No cirrhosis,

346
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:47,792
- no scarring, no infection.
- Blood panel?

347
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,840
Elevated albumen: 7.2.

348
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,256
- That's it?
- Everything else is fine.

349
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:55,942
So it was a waste of time.

350
00:18:56,986 --> 00:19:00,513
Unless it's not his liver
that's elevating his albumen.

351
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:04,335
- It's his kidneys.
- Renal failure. Explains the anemia.

352
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,729
If he developed hyperkalemia,
that would explain the ataxia.

353
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,106
- But the stroke...
- Ischemic encephalopathy.

354
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,799
Nice.

355
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,154
Except we have to stay
and test his kidneys.

356
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:30,578
Key under the mat.

357
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,546
- There's no key under the mat.
- Right.

358
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:36,591
You need to replace
one of your kitchen windows.

359
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:42,053
I helped myself to your wine cellar.
I'll leave a buck on the way out.

360
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:45,809
- You're not right for her.
- And you are?

361
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:47,154
Less wrong.

362
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:52,388
Then I started thinking...

363
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,275
What was I saying?

364
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,783
You were saying it's late, and...

365
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,201
She invited me.

366
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,706
She didn't know if she should.

367
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:09,331
She was trying to figure out
if I really have changed or...

368
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:14,665
if I'm still the same old S.O.B.
I've always been.

369
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,265
She always gave me a chance.

370
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:24,966
832 chances.

371
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:28,022
And I used up every one of them.

372
00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:29,394
832's her limit.

373
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:31,396
Make a note.

374
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:36,893
How 'bout a cup of coffee?

375
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:38,987
It's just instant, but...

376
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:47,639
I'm pathetic.

377
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:51,286
I don't deserve her.

378
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,245
Maybe you should crash here.

379
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:06,205
It's a sofa bed.

380
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:09,254
I love her.

381
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:12,729


382
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,861
Patient's liver's fine.
His kidneys are shot.

383
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:17,370
And where is House?

384
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:19,779
He left a message.
He's not coming in today.

385
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,428
What causes kidney failure?

386
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:23,553
- Rhabdomyolysis.
- No edema.

387
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:27,357
- You had a wonderful Thanksgiving?
- I don't remember.

388
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:29,425
So I guess I did.

389
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:31,175
Multiple myeloma.

390
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,527
- No bone pain.
- You got drunk alone?

391
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:36,872
That would be a sign
that I need to talk to you about this.

392
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:40,197
- Polycystic kidney disease?
- No UTIs or flank pain.

393
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:44,514
What if his cough
is more than just a cold?

394
00:21:44,757 --> 00:21:46,361
He hasn't been coughing.

395
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:49,397
It's in his history,
and we found cough syrup in his cabinet.

396
00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:52,207
It could mean Goodpasture syndrome,
affects kidneys and lungs.

397
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:54,763
Start him on immunosuppressors
and dialysis.

398
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:57,743
- After we run it by House.
- He's not answering his pager.

399
00:21:57,868 --> 00:22:00,718
- Looks like he's leaving it up to us.
- Us, not you.

400
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:02,743
And since we don't disagree,

401
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,073
you can save your fight
for another case.

402
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:13,858
How long
do I have to be hooked up for?

403
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:15,541
Four to six hours a day

404
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,835
- until we see an improvement.
- What if you don't?

405
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,214
- We keep doing it until a transplant.
- You were sure it was his spleen,

406
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,341
and then you were sure
it was his liver,

407
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,802
which he told you it wasn't,
and now it's his kidneys!

408
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,470
It's definitely his kidneys.

409
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,139
We just don't know
why it's his kidneys.

410
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,330
Any word from Cameron?

411
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,174
I started seeing a counselor
after my diagnosis.

412
00:22:42,682 --> 00:22:44,082
She's really good.

413
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:48,574
Why does everyone assume
everyone works in the exact same way?

414
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:50,099
We pretty much do.

415
00:22:50,224 --> 00:22:52,784
Our egos want us to think
we're all snowflakes, no two alike,

416
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:55,177
but really
we all want the same things.

417
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:57,398
Love, forgiveness...

418
00:22:58,272 --> 00:22:59,272
Chocolate.

419
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,303
What I want
is for everyone to leave me alone.

420
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,828
How do I get that?

421
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:15,226
What did you say
to Lucas last night?

422
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:20,384
I know there were
a lot of consonants.

423
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,300
I don't remember how I got here,
never mind what I said.

424
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:26,570
I talked to him.

425
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:29,835
And he said it'd be better
if we stopped seeing each other.

426
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,460
Said he didn't realize how much
there still was between you and me.

427
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:38,038
And he didn't want to get caught
in the middle of us.

428
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:43,074
I was drunk.

429
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:46,789
- Whatever I said, he can't...
- I've had enough, House.

430
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:50,064
I actually felt bad
about scamming you.

431
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:55,011
But then you lived down
to my expectations

432
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,503
and then some.

433
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,282
There is no "us".

434
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,259
There never will be.

435
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:15,569
It worked.

436
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:18,491
Tell me you're talking
about a medical procedure.

437
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:21,751
They split up this morning.
You're the very first one I've told.

438
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:24,611
And you think
she'll start dating you?

439
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:26,386
I'm sure she hates you.

440
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,356
But her eyes say,

441
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:31,155
"How will I ever pay you
for that tennis lesson?"

442
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:34,002
- What a shame.
- They'll get over it.

443
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:38,062
- I meant for you.
- I'll get over it faster than they do.

444
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,445
Can't believe Lucas fell for my

445
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,707
"I never say this
because it's so personal

446
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:45,976
"except that I'm drunk"
profession of love.

447
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,671
Second-oldest trick in the book.

448
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:50,279
You're right.
It's his fault because he's stupid.

449
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:56,938
He certainly is.

450
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:05,837
You're stupid.

451
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,092
Well, I'm rubber, and you're glue.

452
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,136
He's not pedestrian, he's stupid.

453
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,888
At least stupider than he should be.

454
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,457
He's a DXM junkie.

455
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,354
Dextromethorphan, as in cough syrup?

456
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,144
He wasn't taking it for his cough.

457
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:25,219
It's cheap,
available at your corner drug store,

458
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:28,293
and taken in high doses,
it's a dumb drug.

459
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,847
Dumb drug.
Well, he obviously hasn't...

460
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:33,573
He's smart compared to you.

461
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,141
He's a moron
compared to what he was.

462
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:38,161
Robotripping

463
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,440
lowers the IQ.

464
00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:40,997
It also causes brain damage.

465
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:44,333
Unless taken with the proper amount
of ethanol.

466
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,393
About one drink per day.

467
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:50,597
He wasn't abusing the booze
and taking the cough remedy medicinally.

468
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:52,735
He was abusing the cough meds,

469
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,594
and taking the booze medicinally.

470
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,430
Bravo.

471
00:25:58,478 --> 00:25:59,849
Why would you do that?

472
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,740
If you had a gift,
why would you just throw it away?

473
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:05,515
I didn't throw it away.

474
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,565
I just turned it down a little.

475
00:26:07,873 --> 00:26:09,559
When my brain was on low,

476
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:12,195
everything didn't seem
so miserable anymore.

477
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,763
Life was bearable.

478
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,716
I thought that I did that.

479
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:18,804
You do.

480
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,122
Long-term abuse of DXM
explains all your symptoms.

481
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,501
Even, oh, sweet irony, your cough.

482
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,711
Whole bowel lavage,
activated charcoal.

483
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:31,756
We get all traces of it
out of your system.

484
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,133
You'll be the unhappiest
little courier in no time.

485
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:38,078
I don't think I can live without it.

486
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:42,584
You'd be surprised
what you can live without.

487
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:44,613
Make him a genius.

488
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:45,687


489
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:47,311
I can't believe it.

490
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:50,126
He looks so much better already.

491
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:53,492
We were thinking about calling <i>GQ</i>.

492
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:56,966
Lavage has removed all traces
of DXM from his body.

493
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:00,139
You're drawing again.
What is it?

494
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:02,036
- Just doodles.
- No, it's not.

495
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,254
Come on, Jimmy, I want to know.

496
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,766
This is a toroidal
helicon plasma device.

497
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:16,691
It determines
the amount of energy expended

498
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,053
by he subatomic particles.

499
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,030
I'm thirsty.
Could you get me a juice or something?

500
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:26,739
Of course.

501
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:29,795
I'm so happy, Jimmy.

502
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:37,451
I told you.

503
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:42,661
Do you know what the difference
between her IQ and mine is?

504
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,786
91 points.

505
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:47,491
In relation, she's closer to a gibbon
than she is to me.

506
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,959
Having sex with her
would be an act of bestiality.

507
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:55,008
I assume you didn't marry her
for her skill in applied physics.

508
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,715
I wish she could spell it.

509
00:27:57,994 --> 00:28:00,594
You think you'd be happier
with someone who could spell better?

510
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,807
That's the problem.

511
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:07,177
I'm the one who's a jerk.

512
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:10,034
But I owe her everything.

513
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:14,313
I want to want to be with her.

514
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:17,318
And when I'm clear, I...

515
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,750
I can't.

516
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:26,804
Fainting, dizziness,
shortness of breath?

517
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:27,929
Sometimes.

518
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:30,829
Is the wait always this long?

519
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:32,668
Only on days that end in "day".

520
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,349
Diarrhea, weight loss?

521
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:35,274
A bit.

522
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,244
Don't you ever shave?

523
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:40,384
Yeah. Once a week.
How'bout you?

524
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:44,263
- Stomach pain, tenderness?
- Every now and then.

525
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:46,098
Are you this rude
to all your patients?

526
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,016
Yes. Don't think you're special.

527
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,765
So we've got a lot of vague,
unverifiable symptoms.

528
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:55,054
Yet all the physical signs
are perfectly normal.

529
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:58,667
- What do you think I have?
- I'm not sure, but I think it's...

530
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:00,112
a lame job.

531
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:01,243
What?

532
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:02,823
You're a rat.

533
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,092
Insurance company sends you out
to check on the quality of medical care.

534
00:29:06,217 --> 00:29:08,370
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it really?

535
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,498
'Cause you seem a lot more interested
in asking questions than answering them.

536
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,918
Handwriting on your medical records
isn't a doctor's, I can almost read it.

537
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,880
When you went out
for a urine sample,

538
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,590
I looked in your purse.
Found the questions you were supposed

539
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,869
to memorize
before you came to the clinic.

540
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,909
- I was looking for gum.
- You're an ass.

541
00:29:25,254 --> 00:29:27,048
Put it in your report.
I tell you what.

542
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:30,976
I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll pretend
that I'm not when we leave this room.

543
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:36,404
Remember, first ice, then heat.

544
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:39,199
If you have any problems,
don't hesitate to call me.

545
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:40,874
Thank you, Dr. House.

546
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:45,545
Wait a second.
Where's Cuddy?

547
00:29:45,738 --> 00:29:47,088
Gone for the day.

548
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,711
I can't remember if I've mocked you yet
for being a male nurse.

549
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:57,941
I think this counts.

550
00:29:58,475 --> 00:29:59,575
Fair enough.

551
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:05,198
That isn't the man I married.

552
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:06,970
Yes, he is.

553
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:08,815
He's just smarter.

554
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,719
- Give him some time. I'm sure...
- He hates me.

555
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,769
His body is going through
withdrawal.

556
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,897
- He's adjusting.
- Maybe he never loved me. Not really.

557
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:20,401
Maybe we never really
had anything at all.

558
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,102
Somebody help!

559
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:29,295
I can't feel my legs.

560
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,037
I can't feel them.

561
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:36,711
Anywhere.
Nothing.

562
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,564
We have to talk about this.

563
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:47,063
It's late. I'm tired.

564
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:53,058
I know it's a big pay cut, but I'll
always have the chance to make money.

565
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,771
I won't always have
the chance to do this job.

566
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,609
That's what you think?
That it's about the money?

567
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,486
So it's that I didn't consult you
before I took the job?

568
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,106
That was offensive,
but it's not about that either.

569
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:06,231
So then...

570
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:11,788
Can you give me the first letter?

571
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:16,168
When we got married,

572
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:19,376
you were an intern working
30-hour shifts doing grunt work.

573
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,676
We both put up with it because we knew
that it was leading to something better.

574
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,538
In your private practice,
you are the boss.

575
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,883
You call the shots,

576
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:29,928
but now you're 40 years old,
you're still doing grunt work.

577
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:34,224
That's what this is about?
You think I'm a wuss?

578
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,630
He made you miss
Thanksgiving dinner.

579
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:51,821
Vitamin B12 deficiency?
Gives us anemia, numbness.

580
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:54,224
- Not a stroke.
- If he has a vascular malformation...

581
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:55,787
Anemia's not macrocytic.

582
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:01,431
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Dying patients can be so thoughtless.

583
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:02,741
Don't.

584
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:06,093
Great comeback. Is that Oscar Wilde?
Come on, people.

585
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,648
- Bone marrow malignancy.
- Wouldn't produce schistocytes.

586
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,510
- Lupus.
- Thanks for coming in.

587
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:12,044
ANA was negative.

588
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,112
What about you?

589
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:16,781
Got any predictable drivel
you'd like to add?

590
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:19,853
- They've given you enough already.
- At least they're trying.

591
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,641
They're not sitting there like roadkill.
Give me something.

592
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:24,024
Something,

593
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,486
or I'll get your ex-smarter half
on the phone and ask her.

594
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:05,316
You're gonna be pressing charges?

595
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,509
Against the ottoman I tripped over?

596
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:08,827
Against Chase.

597
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:12,356
I'm pretty sure the ottoman
was acting alone.

598
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:17,369
- You free for dinner this weekend?
- At least three other people saw him.

599
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:19,663
Mass hysteria.
Either night?

600
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,665
I can't have doctors
punching each other out.

601
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,250
My God, who got punched?

602
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:26,897
And more importantly,
for Chase's sake, I need to know

603
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:29,970
if he's able to handle himself
or if I should be getting him some help.

604
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:31,755
He couldn't have punched anyone.

605
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,800
He was with me
when I tripped over the ottoman.

606
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:36,388
If you're not planning on eating,
maybe a movie?

607
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:38,813
I'm not doing this.

608
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:41,304
It's not fun anymore.

609
00:33:42,482 --> 00:33:43,832
Just do your job.

610
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,709
I need your help.

611
00:33:59,694 --> 00:34:01,399
What happened to your face?

612
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:04,519
I was mowing the lawn
when the phone rang.

613
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:06,329
You're a computer.

614
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:08,709
I'm gonna feed you data,
and you analyze it.

615
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:11,674
What, are you gonna feed me
20 years of medical knowledge too?

616
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:14,218
It's not gonna work.

617
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:15,916
I know.

618
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:19,035
But I don't have anyone else to ask.

619
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,243
It's lonely, isn't it?

620
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:27,062
It's not that bad.

621
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,839
Then you're not that smart.

622
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,945
You ever tried to kill yourself?

623
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:35,405
- Not quickly.
- I did.

624
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:38,684
12 years ago I jumped off
the top of my eight-story building

625
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:41,412
into a dumpster bin
the day before pickup.

626
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,305
I broke my collarbone,

627
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,076
my leg, and three ribs.

628
00:34:47,448 --> 00:34:49,643
When I was in the hospital
they put me on narcotics

629
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:52,318
and suddenly everything
was just better.

630
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:56,863
I didn't feel isolated or lonely.

631
00:34:58,257 --> 00:35:02,213
That's where I met my wife.
She was... so happy.

632
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,690
And dumb.

633
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:08,036
And I was...

634
00:35:10,132 --> 00:35:11,032
smart...

635
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,720
and miserable.

636
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:16,770
You tell me who the genius is.

637
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:20,337
I fell in love with her
buzzed out of my head,

638
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:23,852
and I knew I wanted
to stay that way forever.

639
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:33,494
Enjoy.

640
00:35:35,575 --> 00:35:38,325
Easier on your conscience
if I die an idiot?

641
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:40,836
What's a conscience?

642
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,366
Which ribs...

643
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:56,612
did you break in the fall?
They on the left side?

644
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,930
Bottom three.

645
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,007
That was 12 years ago.

646
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:07,967
This probably cost me my marriage,
so it better be awesome.

647
00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:10,000
Ferrous oxide contrast?

648
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,032
Gets absorbed by the spleen.

649
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:14,410
Unless he doesn't have one.

650
00:36:14,535 --> 00:36:16,394
In which case
it's absorbed by the liver,

651
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,532
- and fries that.
- You're killing him?

652
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:20,957
I opened him up
and didn't take out his spleen?

653
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:24,262
All organs do look kind of the same...
red and squishy.

654
00:36:31,806 --> 00:36:33,206
Accessory spleens.

655
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:35,727
Okay, that is amazing.

656
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:38,403
12 years, eight stories,
and a dumpster ago,

657
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:40,030
he broke three ribs,

658
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,192
damaged his spleen.
Bits of it split off,

659
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:43,958
circulated through his bloodstream

660
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:46,103
until they landed
and attached somewhere else.

661
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:48,071
So it is TTP.

662
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,710
I just didn't remove...

663
00:36:52,218 --> 00:36:54,888
- All of his spleens.
- 16 splenectomies.

664
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:58,540
Pretty sure he gets
a set of steak knives with that.

665
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,275
I can outrun you.

666
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:18,485
Sorry about the nose.
And the eye... and the...

667
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:20,167
eyebrow.

668
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:23,031
Guess I deserved it.

669
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,492
If I thought that,
I wouldn't be apologizing.

670
00:37:26,054 --> 00:37:27,454
Your fist slipped?

671
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:31,474
Everybody kept bugging me,
asking if I was okay.

672
00:37:33,026 --> 00:37:36,126
So you busted my nose
to keep people off your back.

673
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:40,591
Pretty much.

674
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,814
Making people even more
worried about you.

675
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:43,802
Maybe.

676
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,165
But at least
they're not talking to me about it.

677
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:49,918
Fair enough.

678
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,210
Cheers.

679
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,746
- Thank you.
- Don't be so grateful.

680
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:05,909
You'll be delivering packages
for 70 years to pay for it.

681
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,995
Well, thanks for our talk.

682
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:13,073
It's been a while
since I had a stimulating conversation.

683
00:38:13,198 --> 00:38:15,292
- So what're you gonna do?
- Go back to my life.

684
00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:17,274
Which one?

685
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,867
The one that has my wife in it.

686
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:23,296
Robo tripping.

687
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:27,262
- How's she feel about that?
- She doesn't have to know.

688
00:38:27,553 --> 00:38:29,181
It's worked for 12 years.

689
00:38:35,268 --> 00:38:37,267
Tell your brain I said good-bye.

690
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:50,188
Einstein's giving himself a lobotomy,
and you're cool with that?

691
00:38:52,941 --> 00:38:54,391
Ignorance is bliss.

692
00:38:58,262 --> 00:38:59,512
Hold that pose.

693
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:07,178
I'll start with t-shirts and mugs,

694
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,803
and see how it goes.

695
00:39:17,347 --> 00:39:18,397
Home early.

696
00:39:22,419 --> 00:39:23,969
What happened to him?

697
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,315
- You beat up House?
- Just one right hook.

698
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,011
Why? What happened?

699
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:36,081
You were right. I told him we need
to lay down some ground rules,

700
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:39,077
- got a little heated.
- That's not what I meant.

701
00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:43,137
Is he okay?
Are you gonna be fired? Arrested?

702
00:39:43,262 --> 00:39:44,662
Everything's fine.

703
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,580
Can we at least be civil?

704
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:18,234
How's your nose?

705
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,459
It's okay.

706
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:22,419
Does your kid like animals?

707
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:27,326
I got tickets to that holiday carnival.
I hear they have a nice petting zoo.

708
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:32,220
- I think I was pretty clear before.
- I don't mean with me.

709
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:35,851
Here. Take 'em. Enjoy.

710
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:38,467
No, thanks.

711
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,917
They're not fake.
I didn't steal them.

712
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:46,952
One of the nurses was selling 'em
for her kid's scout trip.

713
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,987
It doesn't make
things right between us,

714
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,993
I just wanted to do something nice.

715
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:55,761
I don't want them.

716
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:02,852
I'll see you tomorrow.

717
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,899
They didn't split up.

718
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,224
She wouldn't take the tickets.

719
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:19,284
Of course.

720
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:22,009
Wind talker code
for "we never split up."

721
00:41:22,306 --> 00:41:25,509
She told you multiple times
she wants nothing to do with you.

722
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:27,334
I wasn't gonna be there.

723
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:30,362
She just felt guilty
that I felt guilty,

724
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,082
so she couldn't take them.

725
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,658
Either that
or she didn't want to appease you.

726
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,676
These weren't reparations.

727
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,876
Just a simple gesture of remorse,

728
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:40,701
and she slapped it down.

729
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:43,462
They didn't break up.

730
00:41:44,548 --> 00:41:46,920
She just wanted me
to think that so I'd back off.

731
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:51,566
Dare I ask what you're gonna do?

732
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,145
Nothing.

733
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,491
I said they'd either break up
or they'd stay together.

734
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,267
They didn't break up.

735
00:42:02,078 --> 00:42:03,928
And you're okay with that?

736
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,306
It is what it is.

737
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:10,841
Good for you.

738
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,006
House knows I lied.

739
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:23,665
Why? What'd he say?

740
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,359
Nothing.
I could just tell.

741
00:42:26,484 --> 00:42:28,734
You want to stage another breakup?

742
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,051
It seems like
he's gonna leave us alone.

743
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:37,804
Why would he do that?

744
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:39,598
I'm not completely sure.

745
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:42,179
So...

746
00:42:43,678 --> 00:42:45,497
we have his blessing?

747
00:42:46,073 --> 00:42:47,383
I guess so.

748
00:42:47,508 --> 00:42:49,441
I made you some meatballs.

749
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:55,276
Maybe House isn't so bad after all.

750
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,442
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

751
