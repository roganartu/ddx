1
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,788
I don't know about you, but I'm nervous.

2
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,392
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

3
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,679
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

4
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,805
Many children.

5
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,816
This is a great thing, Roz.

6
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,784
I am so happy for you.

7
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,251
Thank you, Mrs. Silver.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,585
Yonatan is a good man,
from a good family.

9
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,528
I know you chose well
for me. I've been blessed.

10
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:52,635
Cross-species mating. I feel
like Darwin in the Galapagos.

11
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,604
Amber and I have a lot in common.

12
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:58,040
<i>She's a Cutthroat Bitch,
you cry over Dark Victory.</i>

13
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,944
Bette Davis. Another
strong, assertive woman.

14
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,605
You don't like strong.
You don't like assertive.

15
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,376
You like needy.

16
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,541
She's not dying, is she?

17
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,984
Yes. Go away.

18
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,655
I give it two months.

19
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,220
Hundred bucks.

20
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,957
It's not really fair.
You're not objective.

21
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,560
But, I'm all about the teaching, so...

22
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,604
We're at four months.

23
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,667
You hid this from me?

24
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,140
I was wrong. Okay?

25
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,608
I thought you'd be upset.

26
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,511
I thought you'd track
me down in hallways...

27
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,241
I shouldn't have discounted the sex.

28
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,285
She's obviously limber enough to
put off the meltdown for two months.

29
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,752
She's not needy. I don't need needy.

30
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,153
She's scary. Why does
scary need pathetic?

31
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,622
Are you going to talk to her?

32
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,286
I don't see that I have any choice.

33
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,991
You're all right with that?
No impulse to save her from me?

34
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,001
I've broken the pattern, House,
which is why this has a chance.

35
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,095
I know you're too suspicious to accept
that without getting out your ruler

36
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,869
and your calipers and your
scanning equipment, so,

37
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,841
go ahead. Get it out of your system.

38
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,221
Thirty-eight year old female
with loss of bladder control,

39
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,053
blood in her urine and a broken
leg from collapsing at her wedding.

40
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,060
Ampicillin for the UTI,
shiny cast for the leg.

41
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,790
You guys know Wilson's dating Amber?

42
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,024
No. Wilson and Amber?

43
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,362
I knew.

44
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,736
I asked her out. She said she'd
just started seeing someone.

45
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,967
Cultures were negative for UTIs.
No signs of previous trauma or STDs.

46
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,134
Kidney cancer.

47
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,734
CT was clean for tumors
and kidney stones.

48
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,836
I thought Amber scared
you guys. She does.

49
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,813
But she also has legs that
go all the way up to Canada.

50
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,907
So do Canadians. It doesn't
mean I want to date one.

51
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,486
Her sodium's low. Could be
endometriosis in the bladder.

52
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:51,182
Low sodium could also be from low food.
Hasidic Jews fast on their wedding day.

53
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,023
Or sodium was absorbed by a
toxin already in her system.

54
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,692
Was it just the legs, or did you
detect something resembling a soul?

55
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,232
She grew on me.

56
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,767
If there's a toxin in her,
it could be carbolic acid.

57
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,166
I'm talking about the patient now.

58
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,831
That much carbolic acid, someone
would have had to poison her.

59
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:07,998
Could have been a Cossack.

60
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,666
If this was 18th-century Poland

61
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,937
and Cossacks were into
household cleansers.

62
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,605
Which is why it's more likely
that the poisoner was poisonee.

63
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,147
Suicide's a sin.

64
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,948
Corollary of, "People lie," is, "People sin.
" And in my world, "People" includes Jews.

65
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,112
She was getting married.

66
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,381
Hasidic women marry young

67
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,924
so they can start pushing
out little "Hasidlings. "

68
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,553
Thirty-eight means a woman not on
anyone's hot list being pushed onto a guy

69
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,620
who's not on anyone's hot
list. No way out. No way out.

70
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,564
Endometriosis fits better than an
epiphany that her life is meaningless.

71
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,627
We should start her on Als
and do a cystoscopy to confirm.

72
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,606
Fine. Check her innards for bad
cells and her home for bad karma.

73
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,771
The carbolic acid should be on the shelf
right next to the regret and the self-loathing.

74
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,980
These people are crazy.

75
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,743
Yeah. She should be self-hating.

76
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,583
I'm not self-hating. I hate religious
people who are out of touch with reality.

77
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,315
You only marry someone
you met three times

78
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,253
if they're carrying your little mistake.

79
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,518
What's their divorce rate?

80
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,288
Cleaners are all organic.
Nothing with carbolic acid.

81
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,591
You like how they hook up?

82
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,633
Romance is just emotional foreplay.

83
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,431
Candlelight meals, flowers... It's as
much a ritual as anything these people do.

84
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,770
Why not go with someone who's pre-vetted,
shares the same values? Cut to the quick.

85
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:20,541
Values may give you the big picture, but
time together gives you the little picture.

86
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,170
Does she chew her food too loud?

87
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,112
Will she leave you alone
during the Final Four?

88
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,377
You commit to something deeper.

89
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,509
You let the little surprises slide.

90
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,644
Surprises kill,

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,280
which is why you only commit
when there are no more surprises.

92
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,484
And you have no more
surprises for your wife.

93
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,020
Do you think this came
up on date number two?

94
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,621
You ever heard of a
Hasidic Jew into hard rock?

95
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,896
She's listed as a
producer on all of these.

96
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,804
Where there's rock and roll and sex,

97
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,702
usually, there's drugs.

98
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,543
I'm Baal T'Shuvah. I became
Hasidic about six months ago.

99
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,674
And before six months ago?

100
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,210
Music business isn't exactly
known for its holiness.

101
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,322
Heroin.

102
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,494
But I've been clean for months.

103
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,926
Yonatan knows

104
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,726
in the broad strokes.

105
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,567
He never actually asked the details.

106
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:25,575
Says what's important is the person
that I am now, not the person I was then.

107
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,379
How do you go all the way from...

108
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,438
I just took a class.

109
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,244
Then I took another class.

110
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,581
And you just completely
left the music business?

111
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,347
Pop music is considered frivolous.

112
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,356
Same reason we don't
watch TV or go to movies.

113
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,757
Your drug use may have
caused some long-term damage.

114
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,799
We're going to need to take a hair
sample to test for latent toxins.

115
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,767
<i>So, you can never watch Star Wars again.</i>

116
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,482
You figure that I'll hire you,
if you promise to dump Wilson.

117
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,657
How did you... Wilson had a key.

118
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,250
You figure that I'll make
your life hell at first,

119
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,729
but I'll eventually see how
good you are and keep you.

120
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:23,497
It's a good plan, don't you think?
Perfectly tailored to your personality.

121
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,103
No, it's not. You know it's not.

122
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,712
Means you just want to stay in my orbit,

123
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,009
because you figure I'll eventually
realize that I made a mistake

124
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,050
and you'll be able to rub my face in it.

125
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,018
I can't wait. It's going to be awesome.

126
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,684
No, it's not. And you know it's not.

127
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,787
'Cause you know that
even if I made a mistake,

128
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,625
I'd never admit that I made a mistake.

129
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:57,002
Which means that you're just
toying with Wilson to toy with me.

130
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,537
Your goal is pure feral vengeance.

131
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,309
Innocent bystander, but
there's a greater good.

132
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,976
No, that's not it.

133
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,711
Because a bag of flaming
poop bypasses the bystander.

134
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,479
So, which is it, House?

135
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,688
Am I in this for you?
Or am I in this for him?

136
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,996
Give him back his sweatshirt.

137
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,702
Pit stains don't become you.

138
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,106
Treatment had no effect,
rules out endometriosis,

139
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,240
and her hair sample was
negative for residue drugs.

140
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,285
This woman lived in the fast
lane till six months ago.

141
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,251
Maybe we're missing something.
She admitted drug use.

142
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,755
Doubt she's holding out on
her days as an asbestos miner.

143
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,950
Cryoglobulinemia might
account for the symptoms.

144
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,527
Except for the one you missed.

145
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,688
Well, there's no
change in her condition.

146
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,889
I'm not talking about a new symptom,

147
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,058
I'm talking about one that
presented six months ago.

148
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:05,194
Look, she's nuts. But we can't just give
her 10 cc of atheism and send her home.

149
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:10,709
Religion is a symptom of irrational
belief and groundless hope.

150
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,147
Altered mental status, on the other
hand, is a symptom of porphyria.

151
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,239
She didn't develop uncontrollable
anger, crying, anxiety,

152
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,750
she just decided to go to Temple.

153
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,788
The woman didn't just
choose to keep kosher.

154
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,086
She went directly to the extremes of
Hasidism and a life of stringent rules.

155
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,285
She became a masochist.

156
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,055
She didn't like her old
life, so she changed it.

157
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,222
People don't change.

158
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,798
They might want to,
might even need to, but...

159
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,562
Taub gave up a six-figure plastic
surgery career for this job.

160
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,571
That mean he has porphyria?

161
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,973
He switched jobs to save his
marriage. He did it to avoid change.

162
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,512
He's right. You don't suddenly choose
crazy without suddenly being crazy.

163
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,480
No. No. If she walked
away from everything,

164
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,074
to go base-jumping or live with apes

165
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,346
we wouldn't be having this discussion.

166
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,787
We would if she was also tinkling
blood out of her over-excited bladder.

167
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,624
Pump Hadassah full of hematin
and give her a phlebotomy.

168
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,930
Bloodletting?

169
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,162
Porphyria is a rare genetic disorder

170
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,465
that causes an over-production
of a certain protein.

171
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,699
Draining the blood relieves...

172
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:19,267
A hair test for damage from drugs
showed she has a rare genetic disease?

173
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,813
Not exactly. We're
testing her now to confirm.

174
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,815
You're treating it
before you confirm it?

175
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,113
Blood test results take 24 hours.

176
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,814
You must have seen something
that makes you suspect it.

177
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,347
Dr. House has a theory.

178
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,120
A theory based on what?

179
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,058
We'd like a different doctor.

180
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,325
I assure you that Dr.
House is our best...

181
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,627
Then we will settle for second best.

182
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,636
Someone who doesn't think my wife
is sick just because she's religious.

183
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,868
If you prefer, I can give your
wife my second-best diagnosis.

184
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,043
Did you know Wilson's dating Amber?

185
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,307
I have reviewed the chart.

186
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,815
Someone on your team
must have pointed out

187
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,579
that cryoglobulinemia
also fits the symptoms.

188
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,052
Yes. It fits many of the symptoms.

189
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,750
My wife's body is sick.
Her mind and soul are fine.

190
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,495
You live according to God's
600 commandments, right?

191
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,825
Six hundred thirteen.

192
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,524
Do you understand them all?

193
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,157
It takes a lifetime of learning.

194
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,599
But you follow the ones
you don't understand,

195
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,932
because the ones you do understand
make sense and you believe

196
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,563
that the guy who created
them knows what he's doing.

197
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,164
Of course.

198
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,109
So, you will trust my diagnosis,
and you'll let me treat her,

199
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,272
because in this Temple, I am Dr. Yahweh.

200
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,415
I want a new doctor.

201
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,520
I'm starting her on indomethacin
for the cryoglobulinemia.

202
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,287
People don't change.

203
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,385
For example, I'm going to keep
repeating, "People don't change. "

204
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,728
So, alcoholics that successfully
go through treatment don't exist.

205
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,427
They're still alcoholics.

206
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,002
If they never take another
drink as long as they live,

207
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,095
it's only because they
didn't live long enough.

208
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:58,302
If you're dissatisfied with your life,
changing it is a symptom of mental health.

209
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,970
I get why that concept
is strange to you.

210
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,987
O2 sats are 85. She's hypoxic.
We might need to intubate.

211
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,449
What's wrong with her?

212
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,118
Well, it's definitely
not cryoglobulinemia.

213
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,989
Better ask him.

214
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,825
We kept her on oxygen overnight.

215
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:28,100
Her respiratory rate's stabilized
and her O-sat's back up to 95.

216
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,169
I saw Amber drop off
Wilson this morning.

217
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,836
Yes. The male always drives the female.

218
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,106
So what caused the breathing problem?

219
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,773
Pulmonary involvement
rules out porphyria.

220
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,248
She kiss him or he kiss her?

221
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,013
I missed it. The lab tech with
the tongue stud also pulled up.

222
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,111
Wegener's would explain
her elevated sed rate.

223
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,623
Wegener's wouldn't explain
the changed mental status.

224
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,592
Actually, we've been trying to
ignore that part of the white board.

225
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,495
I wrote it in black. I'm
always serious when I use black.

226
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,657
Lupus would explain...
Maybe she didn't change.

227
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,257
Are you agreeing with me,
or are you making a point?

228
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,324
I'm making a point.

229
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,392
That's going to take longer.

230
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,236
How do we know that the real Roz isn't
who she is now and who she was then?

231
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,039
Can't we say that her previous life was
true, without making her present one a fraud?

232
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,603
The "life is messy" argument. Nice. Explains
everything without explaining anything.

233
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,174
If it's lupus, there's a heart
problem we don't know about yet.

234
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,118
Run her through a stress test. If
she has a heart attack, I'm right.

235
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,621
Or we could wait, hope that...

236
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,816
You're afraid to give
her a heart attack.

237
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,153
Of course we're afraid to...

238
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,659
No reason to be afraid.

239
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,957
Unless you think I'm right.

240
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,155
It's Wegener's.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,128
But we'll have the
crash cart, just in case.

242
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,575
Oh, my God! What are
you guys doing here?

243
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,244
I had a sudden yen for fusion.

244
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,410
I put a different restaurant in my
date book. I'm firing my assistant.

245
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,487
That's okay. Hi, Greg.

246
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,657
And I call you "Greg" because
we're now social equals.

247
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,026
<i>I call you "Cutthroat Bitch. "
Well, quod erat demonstrandum.</i>

248
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,931
And I speak in Latin, because I
don't try to hide what an ass I am.

249
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,025
I assume you'd like to join us?

250
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,901
It will be easier to observe our
interaction if you're at the same table.

251
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,769
If we ever get seated.

252
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:09,863
Excuse me.

253
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,034
No, no. I...

254
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,939
We've been waiting for...

255
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,778
Any minute now, she's going to hit
him in the face with your testicles.

256
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,581
She tends to treat... She
tends to treat every event

257
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,589
like it's the last
'copter out of Saigon.

258
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,355
She's the anti-Wilson.
She's a force for evil.

259
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,021
She has an annoying
quality. Perhaps even two.

260
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,929
If I was perfect, I would date perfect.

261
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,006
You like that.

262
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,133
It's annoying, but she's good at it.

263
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,801
Wait a second.

264
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,570
This isn't just about the
sex. You like her personality.

265
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,979
You like that she's conniving.

266
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,483
You like that she has no
regard for consequences.

267
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,146
You like that she can humiliate
someone if it serves...

268
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,657
Oh, my God.

269
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,084
You're sleeping with me.

270
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,939
<i>I need you to go faster, Roz.</i>

271
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,471
<i>A little harder.</i>

272
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,809
I am going harder, damn it.

273
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,420
What if Dr. House was right?

274
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,151
And Roz did make a radical change.

275
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,258
Lupus is chronic, but treatable.

276
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,126
And with the treatment,
it would undo the change?

277
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,894
She'll be the way she
was before I knew her?

278
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,094
I don't think it's likely.

279
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,636
Then you don't know for sure.

280
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,904
You'd find someone else.

281
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,273
There isn't someone else.

282
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,508
You've had three dates.

283
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,746
How long have you been married?

284
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:04,914
Twelve years.

285
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,582
And is she the one?

286
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,523
We wouldn't still be
together if she weren't.

287
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,288
I love her as much now as the day...

288
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,830
Well, you should love her more.

289
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,765
The more you know someone,
the more you should love them.

290
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,839
Okay. That's enough, Roz.

291
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,539
Your heart's as strong as a battleship.

292
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,982
Does this mean Dr. House was wrong?

293
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,849
Oh! Oh, my leg!

294
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,020
Heart's strong enough to prove you
wrong about the change in mental status.

295
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,792
Only proves this isn't lupus,

296
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,891
just as the leg pain
proves it isn't Wegener's.

297
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:54,029
Leg pain could be from nerve
entrapment. We're thinking blood clot.

298
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:57,666
Do an MRI to look for
the clot. Then do an FMRI.

299
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,869
An MRI alone will detect...

300
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,138
If the clot hasn't dissolved.

301
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,840
An FMRI could show signs
of a near-ischemic stroke

302
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,678
in post-ischemic parts of the brain.

303
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,876
Give me 10 bucks.

304
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,542
No. I missed lunch.

305
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,816
I thought you went out
with... I missed lunch.

306
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,662
Good symmetrical activity
in both hemispheres.

307
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,097
Caudal structures look
okay. She hasn't changed?

308
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,335
Sex, drugs, rock and roll and the 600
rules of God are all in there somewhere.

309
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,773
We oversimplify people. It's
how the human mind works.

310
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,334
Everything's on or off.
Everything's got a category.

311
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,248
You don't like it.

312
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,045
You don't want to be over-simplified.

313
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,786
<i>Roz, move your right leg.</i>

314
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,856
No one can describe
themselves in 10 words.

315
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,720
Why would we want to
hear anyone else do it?

316
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,091
So you keep it a mystery. No
categories if no one knows anything.

317
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,992
Do you think maybe you're
over-simplifying me, now?

318
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,088
No.

319
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,793
<i>I'm sure you have many reasons
to keep yourself a mystery,</i>

320
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,633
<i>besides the fact that you're bisexual.</i>

321
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:05,037
<i>A denial would have worked
before the long vacant stare.</i>

322
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,044
<i>Roz, move your left leg just an inch.</i>

323
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,912
People who have a problem with boxes
are people who don't fit in them.

324
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,318
You've been working for
House for a long time.

325
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,548
No need for name-calling.

326
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,923
I would ask if this was going to be
lunchtime gossip, but lucky for me...

327
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,188
I don't give a damn.

328
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,157
How's our mental Yentl?

329
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,465
MRI shows no sign of clots,
FMRI shows no problem areas.

330
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,629
Go restart her IV.

331
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,763
What's wrong with it?

332
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,436
Nothing. But like so many of the procedures
we put patients through, it hurts,

333
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,776
which, if she's enjoying it,
will show up in pretty colors.

334
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,816
This is why you wanted an FMRI?

335
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,011
It showed she didn't have a blood
clot, which is diagnostically relevant.

336
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,851
And it can show that she's become a
masochist. Also diagnostically relevant.

337
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,925
And it will be cool.

338
00:19:55,827 --> 00:20:00,628
Either explain which part of my
analysis didn't make sense, or go do it.

339
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,629
It isn't cool.

340
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,373
I'm sorry.

341
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,512
Heavens. Look at her limbic system.

342
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:26,455
Her pleasure centers are
lighting up like a Hanukkah bush.

343
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,453
Foreman must have a
touch like an elephant.

344
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,587
<i>Okay, Roz, we've got what we need.</i>

345
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,923
Yes. It was impressive.

346
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,029
Roz? You all right?

347
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,467
Oh, sorry. I was praying.

348
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,339
All through the procedure?

349
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:53,111
No, when Dr. Foreman apologized, I
knew something bad was going to happen.

350
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,686
She was praying. Could
explain the brain activity.

351
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,332
BP and heart rate are
dropping. She's crashing.

352
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,009
She's stabilizing.

353
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,486
Get her up.

354
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,188
All the way up. On her feet.

355
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,664
Make her do that again.

356
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,203
We've started her on
fludrocortisone and ephedrine.

357
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,714
<i>It's Planet of the Apes.</i>

358
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,477
The apes are the humans.
Humans are the apes.

359
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,246
It's Wacky Wednesday, opposite day.

360
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,719
When you stand up, your BP and heart
rate are supposed to go up. Not...

361
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:09,158
Got it. So, what causes bloody urine,
loss of bladder control, leg pain,

362
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:13,027
altered mental status and
pressure-blood in direction-wrong?

363
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,395
Pheochromocytoma?

364
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,989
Low catecholamines in the urine

365
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,002
means no pheochromocytoma in the Jewess.

366
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,935
Could be systemic sclerosis.

367
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,062
Mental status.

368
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,231
She was praying.

369
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,071
She was in pain. You no
longer think she's crazy?

370
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,544
I can see why she'd be
attracted to that life.

371
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,249
You drank the
Manishewitz-flavored Kool-Aid.

372
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,716
I'm not saying I agree.
I'm just saying...

373
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,946
That there's a rational
basis for the irrational.

374
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,783
They have something that we don't have.

375
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,050
Imaginary friends.

376
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,217
If the toaster's not
working, wiring could be bad.

377
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,284
Which debate is that metaphor
supposed to help us with?

378
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,589
Electrical problem in the heart.

379
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,391
Arrhythmia messes with her
blood flow when she stands,

380
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,796
causes low BP and heart rate.

381
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,300
Could also impact mental
status, everybody's happy.

382
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,870
<i>Run an EP study of her heart.
Find where the wiring's verklempt.</i>

383
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,311
I went by your hotel this morning.
They told me you moved out.

384
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,644
You moved in with CB?

385
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,480
No. Apparently, I moved in with you.

386
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,077
The very fact that you're resisting
my insight proves to me that...

387
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,282
House. You're right.

388
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,952
Why not? Why not date
you? It's brilliant.

389
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,323
We've know each other for years,

390
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,624
we've put up with all kinds
of crap from each other,

391
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,632
and we keep coming back. We're a couple.

392
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,299
Are we still speaking metaphorically?

393
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,735
Amber is exactly what I need.

394
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,569
And you would agree if you
weren't mired in self-loathing,

395
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,632
topped with a thin crust of megalomania.

396
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,474
Hey. That's my best friend's
girl you're talking about.

397
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,741
I was wrong.

398
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,181
House. You're right.

399
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:44,246
She's not me. Well, she is me. But,
that's not why she's attractive.

400
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,153
She's a needy version of me.

401
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,488
It's hard to imagine
such a mythical creature.

402
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,155
You started seeing her
right after I fired her.

403
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,324
I started seeing her four months ago.

404
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,061
She told Kutner it was four weeks.

405
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,467
You lied to me. There
was money on the line.

406
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,303
Because I knew how you'd react and
I knew you wouldn't pay me, anyway.

407
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,138
You knew that I was right.

408
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,203
She wasn't needy. She
was in a bad situation.

409
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,046
There's a difference.

410
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,640
Not to your libido.

411
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,782
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Why are you doing this?

412
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,621
Every time I agree with
you, you find a new argument.

413
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,025
What are you trying to avoid?

414
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:31,499
Well, if you'd looked at me with those
flashing eyes before I was involved...

415
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,427
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

416
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,105
And I use the French
because you're an ass.

417
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,441
Right atrium normal, no arrhythmia.

418
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:49,385
You can become a D'har Master. Does
that require further explanation?

419
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,978
Right ventricle normal.

420
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,320
In college, I was really
into science fiction.

421
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,552
Not like the guys with
the $600 prosthetic ears,

422
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,684
who could swear in Romulan.

423
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,390
That was embarrassing to the rest of us who
just thought it was good, smart literature.

424
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,492
I went to one convention. By senior year,
I was D'har Master in the Klingon Empire.

425
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,729
I'm not going to become Hasidic.

426
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,329
I'm not even going to
become slightly more Reform.

427
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,068
Coronary sinus normal.

428
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,167
You can't have your eyes opened
to something and not act on it.

429
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:18,205
I haven't had my eyes opened. I just
don't think they're crazy anymore.

430
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,379
Then they have something to offer.

431
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,683
She's living proof that sane people
can make radical changes, but House...

432
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,223
He thinks that he can bully...

433
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,424
I'm sorry?

434
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,155
I think she's telling
you to stop deflecting.

435
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,197
Evil tongue. Gossip.

436
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,862
It's okay. Thanks to the
sedative, you won't remember it.

437
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,905
Words are permanent.

438
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:45,170
Someday, you'll say something
that you wish you could take back.

439
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,505
Hiss bundle is normal. Pathways
are all clean. No arrhythmias.

440
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,051
If the toaster doesn't work and
the wiring in the house is fine,

441
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,780
problem's got to be in
the city's power grid.

442
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,378
Autonomic nerve disorder.
Could be Riley-Day Syndrome.

443
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,855
Congratulations on your wedding.

444
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,417
You have a rare and incurable
degenerative disease.

445
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:07,095
I'll set her up for a
thermoregulatory sweat test.

446
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,893
She's bisexual.

447
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,896
What?

448
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,700
I could hear them talking
from inside the MRI.

449
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,000
Hear who? I heard the word sex.

450
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,565
It was interesting.

451
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,543
What was interesting? It doesn't matter.

452
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,274
We're doctors, we never know what's
going to matter. She said sex.

453
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:26,248
If she wants to tell
you, when she wakes up...

454
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,810
Yeah. These people aren't
going to change you at all.

455
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,115
I need you to sleep with Wilson.

456
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,489
Good morning.

457
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,563
He's involved with an
inappropriate woman.

458
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,498
His people are sheep herders,
and Amber's are cattlemen?

459
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,162
He's combined two of his worst qualities.
His love for me and his love for need.

460
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,173
And as administrator of this hospital,
you have to save your star oncologist.

461
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,006
Wish I could help. But as administrator,
there are some people in accounting

462
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,740
I'm scheduled to sleep with first.

463
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,174
Wilson has a pattern with women.

464
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,187
He saves them, then he betrays
them, which then causes guilt,

465
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,314
which then causes him
to go save somebody else.

466
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:10,793
For example, a hospital bureaucrat
nearing 40 who has no personal life.

467
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,454
I suggest you go braless.

468
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,523
I get that "sleep with" is your way
of saying I should talk to him...

469
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,193
No, I really mean "sleep with. "

470
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,933
You're not worried this relationship
will fail, you're worried it'll succeed.

471
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,444
That Wilson will no longer
be at your beck and call 24l7.

472
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,172
That your best friend will change.

473
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,873
People don't change just
because they wish they could.

474
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,951
And it bugs you that he wishes he could.

475
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,647
You'll never lose your friend, House.

476
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,054
You're the long-distance
runner of neediness.

477
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,553
As the chamber heats up, Roz's
body temperature should also rise,

478
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,497
making her sweat and
turning the powder purple.

479
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,534
No change in color means no sweating,

480
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:54,071
which means her central
nervous system is damaged.

481
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,571
I shouldn't see her like this.

482
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,835
We could have a diagnosis as soon
as she comes out of the chamber.

483
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,206
It might be better if you stayed.

484
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,141
It's disrespectful.

485
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,849
I'm sure she imagined the first time
her husband would see her bare like this,

486
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,181
would be celebrating their marriage.

487
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:13,418
Given the circumstances, I think Roz would
sacrifice modesty to have you with her.

488
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,486
Please. Don't do that.

489
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,427
What? I think it's
nice that you're here.

490
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,522
I think... You think it's sweet

491
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:26,761
that I care for her modesty, but that
it's archaic and ultimately irrelevant.

492
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,204
Our traditions aren't
just blind rituals. They...

493
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,841
They mean something.
They have a purpose.

494
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,413
I respect my wife.

495
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,511
And I respect her body.

496
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,753
Her body temperature's stopped climbing.

497
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,952
What's going on?

498
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,588
She's having a seizure.
Need a crash cart!

499
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,392
Blankets, too! She's freezing.

500
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,436
She was supposed to
sweat. And she froze.

501
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,735
<i>Return to the Planet of the Apes.</i>

502
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,775
Hypothermia caused the seizure.

503
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,242
What caused the hypothermia?

504
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,539
Could be infection.

505
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,409
Her white blood cell count was fine.

506
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,472
When she was admitted. She could
have picked something up here.

507
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,574
A complication on a complication?

508
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,676
Her body's doing the opposite
of what it's supposed to.

509
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,652
Her body is Wilson.

510
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,848
How do we respond to that?

511
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,515
We accept that he's happy.

512
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,649
We do the opposite.

513
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,751
So, you want us to what?
Send the patient home?

514
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,594
An infection means that
something's been added to the body.

515
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:31,032
Something that should be expelled.
What's the opposite of that?

516
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:34,594
Something missing from the body.
Could be an enzyme or a hormone.

517
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,640
Cortisol. Could be Addison's.

518
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,868
It fits.

519
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,436
Every symptom.

520
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,980
I'll run a cortisol stimulation test.

521
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,553
Are you sure she doesn't want to
just take you back to her lair,

522
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:56,024
hang you upside-down, and
deposit her eggs in you?

523
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,655
Excellent disguise, House.

524
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,790
You two are really that serious?

525
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:05,324
She's pretty. She's funny.
Maybe she's a little more...

526
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,392
Evil?

527
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,904
...aggressive than you'd expect for me.

528
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:12,568
But, I'm happy. Can't I just enjoy
what that feels like for a while?

529
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,201
How many people have
looked at you trustingly

530
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,212
while you gave them a fatal prognosis?

531
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,715
But you knew it was kinder
to tell them the truth.

532
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,846
Amber compulsively
looks out for number one.

533
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,084
You compulsively look out for
the person that you're with.

534
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:30,491
Your needs are going to feed
her needs until all that's left

535
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,554
is a Wilson chalk outline on the floor.

536
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,862
Sorry.

537
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,666
Wow.

538
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:50,576
That cortisol stuff is great.
Does it work on everything?

539
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,047
I take it you're feeling better.

540
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,607
Still weak, but, yeah.

541
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:00,448
You must be so tired. You should
go home and get some sleep.

542
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,025
I'll stay.

543
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:09,961
I never told you, but you are much better
looking than Mrs. Silver led me to expect.

544
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,558
She never liked me. When I was eight,

545
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,695
I threw up on her shoes
at my uncle's wedding.

546
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,067
Your abdomen's a little swollen.

547
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,472
Is it serious?

548
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:23,138
It's hard to say. Sometimes it can
mean a liver issue. We'll have to test.

549
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,308
Oh. Oh, dizziness is getting...

550
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,212
She's going into shock, I need another
liter of saline! Type and cross two units!

551
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,314
What's happening to her?

552
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,155
She's bleeding internally.

553
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,494
She's saying the Sh'ma.
She thinks she's dying.

554
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:49,471
The MRA shows you're bleeding internally,
but not where it's coming from.

555
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,304
The blood can only keep
you stable for so long.

556
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,902
Our best option is to
open you up and search.

557
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,208
But you can fix it.

558
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,909
If we find the leak.

559
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,176
You find the bleeding,
you find the disease?

560
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,587
No.

561
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,919
But it could keep you alive long enough

562
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,085
so Dr. House can find
what's wrong with you.

563
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,491
No.

564
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,598
I don't want to have the surgery.

565
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,607
It's the only chance you've got.

566
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:27,304
I don't want to have the
surgery until after sunset.

567
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,673
I'm probably going to die, anyway.

568
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,650
I just want to share one
Shabbat with my husband.

569
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:45,795
Roz, please. The Torah
commands us to preserve life.

570
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,166
I waited 38 years to find what I wanted.

571
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,361
I can wait another eight hours.

572
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,040
And I'll leave the rest to God, okay?

573
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,684
I had her rabbi call. She's adamant.

574
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,388
She's not a masochist. She's suicidal.

575
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,322
Nice work, Chase.

576
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,831
Yeah, I should have had
twin rabbis call. Can I go?

577
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,388
We need you.

578
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:27,895
So, instead of a few days, we now
have a few hours to figure this out.

579
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,036
Nice work, Chase. Why do you need me?

580
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:34,044
Saying, "Nice work, Chase" when
you're not here is pointless.

581
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,103
Seriously. We need you.

582
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,379
We should X-ray for malformations of the
rib that could cause arterial twisting.

583
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,547
Malformations don't cause bloody urine.

584
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,954
She's not suicidal.

585
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,390
She made a commitment to a
new life with her husband,

586
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,452
and she wants one meaningful
experience in that life.

587
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,587
She just met the guy.

588
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,258
Taub just met her and he's already
so in love he's ready to let her die

589
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,929
and take her back to the home planet
for a burial in the lava sea of Tormiad.

590
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,700
It's who he might be.

591
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,572
She's connecting with all the
years she's not going to have.

592
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:09,477
A better way of connecting to those
years is to actually have them.

593
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,906
You want more time?

594
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:19,322
Joshua got God to make the sun stand
still. No reason God can't speed it up.

595
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,750
And by God, I, of course, mean you.

596
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,763
Told you we needed you.

597
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,728
It's sundown, Roz.

598
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,397
We're taking you back to your
room for your candlelight dinner.

599
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,441
Ready? One, two, three.

600
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,109
It's too early.

601
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,741
Your sense of time is off
because of the medication.

602
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,663
<i>Good shabbos, Roz.</i>

603
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:10,005
So, you pray, scarf down some
challah, then we can do this?

604
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,122
You wanted to see me?

605
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,290
And you came.

606
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:34,161
I feel pretty confident it'll
be something interesting.

607
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,292
Solve this case and the job is yours.

608
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,732
Is there a "Drop Wilson"
clause attached to this?

609
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,809
Standard contract all employees sign.

610
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,349
Why do you have to believe
I have an ulterior motive?

611
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:04,360
For the same reason I believe a crack
whore is going to have sex for crack.

612
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,659
All my life,

613
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,530
I thought I had to choose between

614
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,931
love and respect.

615
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,668
And I chose respect.

616
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,041
And with Wilson,

617
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,742
I know what it's like to have both.

618
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,617
And that beats a fellowship.

619
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,840
Could be DIC.

620
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,707
You've changed.

621
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,908
I hope so.

622
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,619
Normal platelet count rules
out DIC. Good try, though.

623
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,954
I read that a hydatid cyst could...

624
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,465
Would affect the lungs, not the bladder.

625
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,730
I tested her white cell
count again. Normal.

626
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,065
How long till we get to cut her open?

627
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:56,799
<i>When I left, he was still
singing Eshat something.</i>

628
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:01,402
<i>It's the husband's blessing of his
wife. He calls her Eshet Chayil.</i>

629
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:08,411
<i>Woman of Valor. "Strength and honor are
her clothing. She laughs at the future. "</i>

630
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,044
Because she's an idiot.

631
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,024
Volvulus of the small
intestine could cause bleeding.

632
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,526
She would have had constipation.

633
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:22,859
Her value isn't beyond pearls, either.
Because dead people have no value.

634
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,230
Polycythemia vera.

635
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,202
RBC count would be higher.

636
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,334
I need to bring the light to my face.

637
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,173
<i>Thrombocytopenia. If it's autoimmune...</i>

638
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,376
<i>Titers were normal.</i>

639
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,214
Parkinson's would
explain the hypothermia.

640
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,777
Not the bloody urine.

641
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:49,121
The woman's not just a
masochist, she's a hypocrite.

642
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,423
<i>The commandment to preserve
life comes before all others.</i>

643
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,066
Actually means she's not a masochist.
She's not following all the rules.

644
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,430
Just the ones that please her.

645
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,766
Right. She walked in crazy and
explained how ritual trumps living,

646
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,600
and you decide it's
a beautiful lifestyle.

647
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,538
I know. She's wrong,

648
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,337
<i>but, if there's nothing more...</i>

649
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,139
<i>Then, the only meaning is here.</i>

650
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,304
<i>But if she thinks God is there for her,</i>

651
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:14,145
if she lives her life
believing that God is there...

652
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,048
Then, she dies.

653
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:24,150
Things aren't where we want them to be,
just because we want them to be there.

654
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,400
Of course, that doesn't mean
they're where they should be.

655
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,401
Hey. Stop that Jew.

656
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:41,378
<i>Chase hates working on shabbos. I'm
going to make this easier for him.</i>

657
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,503
Stand her up.

658
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,774
She doesn't do so well on her feet.

659
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,112
Neither do I. Stand her up.

660
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,828
You can tell all the ladies
at the Mikvah about this.

661
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,064
What did you do?

662
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,041
What are you doing?

663
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,348
Put your hand here. Press hard.

664
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,986
You have nephroptosis. Also
known as "floating kidney. "

665
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,759
The kidney is like a chandelier.

666
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:39,063
It's attached to a ceiling of
intestines and blood vessels.

667
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,869
<i>But your contractor, I think you know
who he is, he hung it with a cheap chain.</i>

668
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,875
<i>It's been hanging sloppy for years.</i>

669
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,433
<i>Finally, something shook it loose.</i>

670
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,070
After that, every time you stood,

671
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,944
your kidney dropped a few centimeters.

672
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,346
That caused all of your symptoms.

673
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,714
None of the scans picked it up.

674
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,844
Because we do scans
with patients lying down.

675
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,448
She would have been lying down in
surgery, too. They'd never have found it.

676
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:01,582
Good chance she'd never come out.

677
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,683
She'll be all right?

678
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,193
Ultrasound to confirm.

679
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,786
Then, tell Chase, to put
the kidney back on the shelf.

680
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,024
The bleed will be nearby.

681
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,290
That's it?

683
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,597
Couple hours surgery,

684
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,435
you'll be ready to push
out those 14 children.

685
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,040
You do it both ways, right?

686
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,041
What? The ultrasound.

687
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,880
You do it standing up and lying down.

688
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,078
What else would I mean?

689
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,998
I've decided you could do worse
than a female proxy for me.

690
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,754
So, you're going to acknowledge
that people can change?

691
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,316
No. You think I've changed

692
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,327
or Amber's changed? Nope.

693
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,021
Then, you've changed.

694
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,827
If you do change, can it be the
part of you that chases me down halls

695
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,663
trying to change me?

696
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,293
Do you know what this means?

697
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,965
That you made one good dating choice.

698
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,203
The fabric of the space-time
continuum could unravel.

699
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,905
My world could expand. I could form

700
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,415
a long-term connection,
that isn't with you.

701
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,816
And since you put the darkest
possible construction on everything,

702
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,412
you could end up losing a friend.

703
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,352
You've thought of all this.

704
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,992
And yet, you're going along with it.

705
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,934
Are you being self-sacrificing?

706
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,233
I'll sacrifice a lab rat.

707
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,773
I'll sacrifice a fly.

708
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,072
I'll sacrifice $200 on a
mudder at Monmouth Park.

709
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,169
I don't sacrifice self.
