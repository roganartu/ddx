1
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:39,181
Excuse me.

2
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,659
I've been waiting here
for over an hour.

3
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:44,332
All I need is a refill
on my migraine medication.

4
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:47,307
- We'll get to you as soon as we can.
- You can get to me now.

5
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:49,688
It'll only take you two minutes.

6
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:52,756
- You're not an emergency.
- This isn't an emergency room.

7
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:55,655
And it's not gonna go any faster
by pissing me off.

8
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,643
- Got a minute?
- No.

9
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,657
Routine checkup can wait.
What else you got?

10
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:05,401
I'm consulting on some clinical trials
that involve C.N.S. Compounds.

11
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:07,317
While it's true
that no sometimes means yes,

12
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:10,223
- in this context...
- One's a new Huntington's drug.

13
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:12,774
Phase three trials
are showing real results

14
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,625
delaying neuronal degeneration.

15
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:16,743
I can probably get you in.

16
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:19,453
No, thanks.

17
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,415
Are you doing anything about it,
following any kind of program?

18
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,793
No. Now am I looking for a consult.

19
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:50,067
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Dr. Cuddy.

20
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:52,903
Well, she's either not here,
or she's under the desk.

21
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:55,531
You're gonna have
to wait outside until I'm finished.

22
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:59,925
- Do you know when she'll be back?
- Yes, which is why

23
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,787
I need you to get out
and leave me alone.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Sorry.

25
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:34,695
Nice try. Love to help.

26
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:36,326
Shut up!

27
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,288
- You wanted to see doctor...
- I said shut up.

28
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,249
I'm sick, and I want to know why.

29
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:50,669
I want the best doctor
in this hospital here, now...

30
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:53,502
Or I'm gonna start killing people.

31
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:04,809
What seems to be the problem?

32
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,939
House - Season 5 Episode 09

36
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,418
Close those blinds.

37
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:42,471
You, push the sofa
in front of that door.

38
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,890
You, move that table
in front of the other door.

39
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:48,468
Now!

40
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,517
Just move it.

41
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,900
You don't have to point the gun man.
We're gonna do whatever you want.

42
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:56,151
No, we're not.

43
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,275
That's a bathroom you're barricading.
It might come in handy,

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,281
especially since
you've cleverly decided

45
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:08,622
to take a bunch
of sick people hostage.

46
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:10,009
Do it!

47
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:17,360
My medical records.
I need you to read them.

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
You really think that
reenacting dog day afternoon

49
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,468
is the best way to get diagnosed?

50
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:24,930
I'm sure you've been waiting for hours
in an uncomfortable chair, but...

51
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,339
you should watch the movie
all the way through.

52
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:29,184
I've been to 16 doctors

53
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:31,103
in the last two years.

54
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:33,397
Had three full-body CTS

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,799
and two MRIS,

56
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:38,581
seven blood panels,
and one homeopathic consult.

57
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,101
And all that was missing
was the threat of violence.

58
00:04:42,226 --> 00:04:44,074
What's missing is an answer!

59
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,901
I can't breathe!

60
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:48,918
I'm tired... All the time.

61
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:53,083
I get skin rashes,
and heart palpitations,

62
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:54,418
and insomnia.

63
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:57,277
That's a cool constellation
of symptoms.

64
00:04:57,948 --> 00:05:00,940
It could be something minor.
At least compared to life in prison,

65
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:04,094
which is what you seem to prefer
to seeing 16 more specialists.

66
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,255
Shut up and do your job.

67
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:31,085
You barely looked at the file.

68
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:33,645
No need. Symptoms...

69
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:35,918
Those are the things
you keep whining about.

70
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:38,499
Tests-negative,
or you wouldn't be here.

71
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:40,756
History-shy, quiet kid.

72
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,085
Kept to himself.

73
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,468
Collected comic books
and missing children.

74
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:48,055
Excuse me, my wife feels sick
to her stomach.

75
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,516
Next time pack some heat,
maybe we'll look into it.

76
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,500
I'll be okay.

77
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:02,956
If you ask me,

78
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,073
keeping an open line of communication
is the best way to resolve conflict.

79
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,535
What kind of breathing problems?

80
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,343
Shortness of breath.

81
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:14,985
And...

82
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,942
sharp pain when I inhale.

83
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:20,671
So you figured your wife left you

84
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:23,257
because you couldn't breathe, right?

85
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,759
Me, I rarely kidnap someone

86
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,178
unless I've got
a serious health problem.

87
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:30,423
Since you're not almost dead,
it means you're armed

88
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:33,183
`cause you're blaming something
other than your health on your health.

89
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:35,060
I've never been married.

90
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:38,650
- Got a match?
- Why?

91
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,927
Because I'd rather not stand here
while you try

92
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:43,569
and negotiate a hostage trade
for an incentive spirometer.

93
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,030
- I'll look in Cuddy's desk.
- Stay out of the desk!

94
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,364
She doesn't smoke.

95
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:48,866
He does.

96
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:50,701
- No, I don't.
- Right.

97
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,703
You brush your teeth
with coffee grounds.

98
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:55,539
Look, sir, I've never smoked
in my life, OK?

99
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,458
Jerk.

100
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:03,547
You figure that two people
snuck weapons into the clinic today?

101
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,216
I'm sorry. It's just...

102
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,843
I got a lighter.

103
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:10,679
Slowly.

104
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:21,744
Hold it out as far as you can.
Try to blow it out.

105
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:36,858
Decreased lung volume.
Heart palpitations,

106
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,601
fatigue, stomach pain.

107
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:40,793
An intermittent rash-
Could be 100 things.

108
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,711
If you add on that final symptom,

109
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,891
it can only be
pulmonary scleroderma.

110
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:47,119
What final symptom?
Those were all my symptoms.

111
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:49,575
Last one is the 16 doctors
who missed it.

112
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:52,492
Simple alkylating agent,
case solved.

113
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:54,139
See you on visitor's day.

114
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:11,323
- Crime scene!
- What's going on in there?

115
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,450
- Is everyone all right?
- About to be.

116
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,702
Assuming he's not lying.
But he seems like a pretty

117
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,204
straight arrow to me.

118
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,619
I'm gonna need some propofol
to prove that

119
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:24,406
it's pulmonary scleroderma.

120
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:26,421
- Then we all get to go home.
- Propofol?

121
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:30,488
- Have one of the guards bring it in.
- No, no guards. No cops.

122
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:33,220
- I'll go get it.
- No one's leaving.

123
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:42,771
She's not a cop?

124
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:45,023
Dr. Cuddy brings in the drugs.

125
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,567
Alone.

126
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:48,318
She might be armed.

127
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,085
I'd have her deliver it shirtless.

128
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,567
Who is it?

129
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,183
Oh, god, House.

130
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,852
- Maybe we should wait for...
- Guys with even bigger guns?

131
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,244
- Who know how to talk to armed...
- Say good-bye or I shoot her.

132
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,068
Roll up your sleeve.

133
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
Give it to someone else first.

134
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,575
You're the only one who needs it.

135
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,173
Give it to someone else.

136
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,967
If it goes in okay, you can give
a second dose to me.

137
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:59,501
I don't care who. Just pick someone.

138
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:03,305
Again, had your brilliant plan
included a roomful of hostages

139
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,906
that don't have fetuses,
bacterial and fungal infections,

140
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:10,108
leaving their immune systems too week
to deal with the metabolic strain,

141
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:12,986
or are already on pain killers
that have fatal interactions...

142
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,980
He's not on pain killers.

143
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:16,849
I heard him tell her in the clinic.

144
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,242
Come on, man.

145
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:21,573
Don't take it out on us.
You got a problem with doctors?

146
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,768
Take it out on the doctors.

147
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,451
Give it to her.

148
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:29,276
She's sick.

149
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,685
You are a very large creep.

150
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,951
Take off your shirt.

151
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:46,100
Satisfied?

152
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:47,767
Fine.

153
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,984
Roll up your sleeve.

154
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:07,582
You think I'm an idiot?!

155
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,148
That's what you think?!

156
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:12,879
I thought I had a little more time
with a guy that size.

157
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,252
You're not gonna do anything.

158
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:22,593
You still need me.

159
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:27,811
Come on!

160
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,906
What are you doing?
He didn't do anything.

161
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:31,773
You're right. I need you.

162
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,110
I also need you to know
you can't screw with me.

163
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:53,559
It's for you.

164
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,648
Lieutenant Bowman, Princeton SWAT.

165
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,481
Dr. Lisa Cuddy, dean of medicine.

166
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:24,785
We just heard a gunshot,
but I haven't been able to make contact.

167
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:29,599
We'll handle that once
we secure our perimeter

168
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:31,032
and set up our positions.

169
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,251
By "perimeters,"
I assume you mean snipers?

170
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,913
- We have to put an end to this.
- Got a husband in there or a loved one?

171
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:38,426
- No.
- Don't worry,

172
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:40,092
we'll decide when to start shooting.

173
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:46,075
House is gonna get someone killed.

174
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,761
Guy's ready to kill for a diagnosis,
I can't think of a better doctor

175
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:51,463
- to be trapped in there with him.
- How'bout someone who's not gonna

176
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:54,081
keep pushing the whack job's buttons
until he cracks?

177
00:12:57,483 --> 00:12:58,468
It's House.

178
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:07,160
- Joe's bar and grill.
- It's foreman,

179
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:10,233
and every fellow you've had
in the last five years.

180
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:13,667
What causes low lung volume,

181
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:16,461
heart palpitations, fatigue,
stomach pain,

182
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,299
insomnia, and a rash?

183
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,836
This is pathetic.
If I strap a bomb to my chest,

184
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:22,975
do I get seven doctors
attending to me?

185
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:24,700
Dr. Robert chase.

186
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,575
On the off chance you have
some brilliant escape plan

187
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,433
and are the vengeful type.

188
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:32,460
You think he's the only guy
in New Jersey with an unsolved illness

189
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:33,668
and a pistol?

190
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:36,675
- I'm not playing this game.
- Seriously?

191
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,484
You're walking out?

192
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,321
No, he's just kidding.
He's right here.

193
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:45,297
Throw me that marker, will you?

194
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:49,661
Chest pain, the lung problems,
fatigue, rash.

195
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:51,455
Sounds like chronic lung infection.

196
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,122
Heart palpitations and fatigue

197
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,667
could be a cancer
that's spread from the lungs.

198
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:58,879
- Next!
- If his diaphragm's not working,

199
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,590
- his nerves are freezing up.
- I think he's going into shock.

200
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,775
First rule of triage,
guys with guns go first.

201
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,635
Next!

202
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,172
The shortest distance between
stomach pain and insomnia

203
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:09,347
is bad circulation.

204
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,600
Plus troubled breathing.
Could be a heart defect.

205
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:18,315
You needed to write
four things down to remember 'em?

206
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:23,185
It's not my wall.

207
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,072
You're gonna get
some special deliveries.

208
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:27,619
We're gonna draw blood.

209
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:30,035
Run tests for infection and cancer.

210
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,995
Cameron, comb through
his medical records.

211
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:34,289
See if any of his past
900 medications

212
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,666
could have screwed up his heart.
Taub, Kutner, go to

213
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:38,551
his apartment,
check for neurotoxins.

214
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,712
873 Marshall, South Brunswick.

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,590
Back window's unlocked.

216
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,095
Giving out your address.
Clearly you're not going back there.

217
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,598
Means you do have an end game.

218
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,687
Lieutenant Bowman.
How's everyone doing in there?

219
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,524
Got one lower limb flesh wound,

220
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,025
another guy unconscious.

221
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:03,985
Unfortunately, not the guy we hoped.

222
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:06,863
We're gonna need someone
to deliver his blood.

223
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,370
- It's gonna be hard to play doctor...
- Shut up.

224
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:17,499
Open that blind.

225
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,243
Just a few inches.

226
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,568
- Why me?
- Just open it. Open it!

227
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:24,923
Why me? Anyone can do it.
Why pick me?

228
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:32,801
Get back! Get back!

229
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:37,435
I will kill her unless you back
the hell out of there now!

230
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:47,100
Interesting.

231
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,518
Anybody else hear those guys
outside?

232
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:53,734
Anybody?

233
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,000
He's got hyperacusis.

234
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,535
What does that mean?

235
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,765
It means we have a favorite.

236
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:03,709
It's nerve related.

237
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:07,465
Amped-up hearing could be linked
to nerve palsy.

238
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,884
Puff out your cheeks. Come on.

239
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,639
Big mug shot smile.

240
00:16:16,657 --> 00:16:18,018
Left side facial weakness.

241
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:20,145
Seventh nerve palsy.

242
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,285
Plus intermittent rashes.
Plus migraines.

243
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:25,233
It's post-herpetic neuralgia.

244
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,475
Herpetic? You think I have herpes?

245
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,868
I'm not judging here.

246
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:31,156
This thing is just as likely
to be caused by chicken pox.

247
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,782
I need proof now.

248
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:34,459
There is a test.

249
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,150
It's dangerous and painful

250
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:38,246
while the treatment
is safe and painless.

251
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,307
But you make a good point.
You need proof now.

252
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:43,976
I'll order up the test.

253
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,672
If you have neuralgia,
you won't feel it going in.

254
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,675
It only hurts
if your diagnosis is wrong?

255
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,118
Win-win.

256
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:07,935
Jason,
don't hang up the phone again.

257
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:11,450
- You're gonna send in...
- Capsaicin.

258
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,866
- 200 micrograms.
- And two syringes this time.

259
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,052
And we'll give you the blood
and his records.

260
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:18,495
No more meds, Jason,

261
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,175
and no deliveries
without something in return.

262
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,418
You've gotta give us a hostage.

263
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,700
You can have two.

264
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:28,175
Great.

265
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,399
Then I'll send an officer
right in with the transfer.

266
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:32,499
Everything gets brought in
by Dr. Cuddy.

267
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:34,594
Jason, I'm not gonna let her
do that.

268
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,600
First-don't use his name so much.

269
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,748
It doesn't sound reassuring,
it just creepy.

270
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:41,477
Second-come on, he's not gonna shoot

271
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,006
the one person he trusts
to bring in his medication.

272
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,981
He's gonna shoot hostages
if she doesn't bring it in.

273
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,118
I'll get back to you.

274
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,444
The guy's demanding that
you do all the transfers.

275
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay.

276
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:00,600
Okay?

277
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:04,119
- What am I supposed to say?
- You're supposed to say no.

278
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:05,910
It's not your job.

279
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:08,983
If you got a conflict here,
if you have stakes in this that

280
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:11,326
you're not telling me about,
then I can't trust you.

281
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:12,483
Got it.

282
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,336
I'm okay.

283
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:18,152
Can you tell him I'm coming in now?

284
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:55,699
Who's taking the first dose?

285
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:58,427
Anybody here got a long-standing
case of neuralgia

286
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,349
that's killed their nerves
so this won't hurt at all?

287
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,901
How bad does it hurt?

288
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,227
- You're looking to be the hero?
- Well, I've been beaten up a lot,

289
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,772
- and I can handle pain.
- How old are you?

290
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,601
The guy's got a gun.

291
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:12,799
I think that covers
the parental consent issue.

292
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:15,570
And that stuff can also cause
nerve and muscle damage.

293
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,880
I'm not taking that crap.

294
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,742
- Come on.
- You have to.

295
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:37,860
It's the rules.

296
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:39,518
I'll do it.

297
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:53,199
This is a level of risk taking
beyond anonymous girl-on-girl action.

298
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:55,275
They're patients. I'm a doctor.

299
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:58,600
With a degenerative,
drug-unfriendly illness.

300
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,856
Everything's not some
fascinating character flaw.

301
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:04,899
This is a genetic flaw.
This is your huntington's speaking.

302
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:07,099
This is you waving
a white flag at the world.

303
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:08,706
Yes, I have a shortened lifespan.

304
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,626
Another reason why I'm
objectively the right choice.

305
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:18,219
I would have laid money
you had herpes.

306
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:21,117
Your turn.

307
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,843
Why are we here?

308
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,599
We've ruled out
immediate risk of death,

309
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:27,767
lost love.

310
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:30,000
That just leaves...

311
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:31,300
Work?

312
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,315
You're defined by your work.

313
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,975
But you kept seeing doctors,
kept missing time.

314
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,284
Couldn't focus.

315
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:42,127
Maybe you made a huge mistake...

316
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,900
Got fired.

317
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,568
I just want an answer.

318
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:47,842
I know.

319
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,709
I'm asking why.

320
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
Guy knew he wasn't coming back.

321
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,675
Everything's laid out for us.
I'll check for toxins in the kitchen.

322
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,175
He must have $6,000, $7,000
in unpaid medical bills.

323
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,778
I've got debt,
you don't see me acting like a lunatic.

324
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:25,066
There's no excuse for what he's doing,
but you've got millions of people

325
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,287
thousands of dollars in debt
because they're sick...

326
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,048
At least one of them's
gonna do something inexcusable.

327
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:31,816
Especially if it works.

328
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,631
White blood cell count's normal.

329
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:40,548
It's not infection.

330
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:46,300
So either his heart's on the fritz,

331
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:48,175
or he's got cancer.

332
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,275
Found a picture of his mom. She's got
a droopy eye, fat face, thick neck.

333
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,828
- Classic signs of an upper-lobe tumor.
- Or she's just ugly.

334
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:56,782
There are also signs
of an adrenal problem.

335
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:58,066
It's his heart.

336
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:02,300
- You can't be sure what...
- His neck. Distended jugular.

337
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,179
- What are you doing?
- I am going to try to strangle you

338
00:22:10,304 --> 00:22:13,413
- faster than you can pull a trigger.
- He needs to check your pulse.

339
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,837
It's racing. 160.

340
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,623
We need to get paddles.

341
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:24,383
Or maybe we could just do nothing.

342
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:26,149
If I get any weaker...

343
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,494
And they don't fix it...
I'll shoot...

344
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:29,638
- You!
- Don't.

345
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,224
- He didn't mean...
- Shut up!

346
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,300
All of you.

347
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:37,305
What are... What are you doing?

348
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,690
- What are you doing?
- Carotid massage...

349
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,493
Gotta slow your heart.

350
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,235
It's 200.

351
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,875
Well, get the paddles.

352
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,275
Whole point of those things is
to make your muscles contract.

353
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,450
They don't discriminate
against trigger fingers.

354
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,755
Nobody gets my gun.

355
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:52,202
Send in paddles!

356
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,372
- Don't!
- Get the damn paddles!

357
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,919
Or I'll shoot you.

358
00:22:58,463 --> 00:23:00,800
Threatening to shoot the guy
who's diagnosing you

359
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,475
makes a lot of sense.

360
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,924
Actually doing it, not so much.

361
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,544
- Give him your gun so he can save you.
- Just let him die.

362
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:08,675
Stop.

363
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,300
We can cardiovert chemically.

364
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:14,602
- If we ignore what heart rhythm...
- If we don't try, he'll kill someone.

365
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,310
- I get the drugs.
- Don't move!

366
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,000
If she doesn't come back,

367
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,725
There are plenty of other people
you can't shoot.

368
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,700
You, come here.

369
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,159
All right...

370
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:38,322
30 seconds.

371
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,500
She's gonna go.

372
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,250
She's gonna come back.

373
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,162
She should go.

374
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:10,262
He'll kill him.

375
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
But not her.

376
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,400
That your version of morality?

377
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,275
If you don't think your life is
worth more than someone else's,

378
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,041
sign your donor card
and kill yourself.

379
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:33,221
Shoot me.

380
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,800
- You really want-
- Yes.

381
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,775
She just needs time!
She needs more time to find the right...

382
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:46,136
the right drug...
She needs time, time...

383
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:47,200
It's me.

384
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,937
She takes it first.

385
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,847
Adenosine slows the heart.

386
00:25:02,972 --> 00:25:04,873
Which is fine,
if it's beating fast like yours.

387
00:25:04,998 --> 00:25:06,675
Not fine if it's normal, like hers.

388
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,575
- Following the math on this?
- She takes everything I take.

389
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't want anything
that cross-reacts.

390
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,235
The martyr's heart is beating
dangerously slow.

391
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,610
Are we good to go?

392
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Your heart's back to normal.
No tachycardia.

393
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,384
No sign of a heart defect at all.

394
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,650
But you're sweating.

395
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:52,674
I nearly had a heart attack.

396
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,499
You're surprised I'm sweating?

397
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:56,674
On one side of your face,
but not the other.

398
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,875
What does that mean?

399
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,473
A tumor is pressing
on your sympathetic nerves.

400
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:03,456
You have lung cancer.

401
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,300
Pulse is down below 50.

402
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,531
So's her I.Q.

403
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
Help her up.
Get her heart going faster.

404
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,975
I need proof it's cancer.

405
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,600
Of course you do!

406
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,540
It's gotta be a pancoast tumor.

407
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:36,875
Patient's got dyspnea,

408
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,075
seventh-nerve palsy.

409
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,199
He's sweating on one side
of his face.

410
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:42,875
- Everything okay in there?
- Take your time.

411
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,675
It's not like I've got a gun
to my head.

412
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,688
Lung cancer usually shows up
lower than the seventh nerve.

413
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,107
- Did you check his throat?
- Spit on the floor.

414
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:51,670
What?

415
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,075
If I do it, I can't tell Cuddy
that it was medically necessary.

416
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,197
I'm gonna ask you to piss
on her chair next.

417
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,475
Dry mouth.
His parotid glands aren't working.

418
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:11,962
It there's swelling, it's
a pancoast tumor that's metastasized.

419
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,700
Feel that.
Right there.

420
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,140
If it's cancer,
there must be a test.

421
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:25,726
- You just did it.
- What about an x-ray or something?

422
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,375
Good idea.

423
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh, damn.

424
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,315
I left my CT machine
in my other pants.

425
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,945
How many hostages
do you think it would cost me

426
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,707
for a trip to radiology?

427
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,761
So...

428
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,300
What made you snap?

429
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
- Hmos?
- Shut up.

430
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,726
You saw 16 doctors.

431
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,171
- How bad could they have been?
- Shut up!

432
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,851
Humiliation?

433
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,813
Doctors treating you
like a piece of meat?

434
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:03,241
Too many fingers and tubes
up your holes.

435
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:06,387
You hate doctors.
You want to take back control.

436
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,900
If so, I apologize for the fact that
you are a piece of meat.

437
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,500
I just want an answer.

438
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:17,117
That's all.

439
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Everyone stays in here with me.

440
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,664
If you need anything
from in there, get it now.

441
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,835
Move around.

442
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:11,481
Anyone moves...

443
00:30:12,637 --> 00:30:13,644
I fire.

444
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,800
That's not all.

445
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,575
Curiosity's not enough.

446
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,500
There's gotta be a deeper reason.

447
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,789
You never did anything
just because you had to know?

448
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:35,916
Never shot anyone.

449
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
You're not me.

450
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,200
This is my body.

451
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,479
This is my life.

452
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,100
And there's a truth out there.

453
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,100
I'd rather rot
in jail knowing than...

454
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
I can't handle not knowing.

455
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,200
Hold that.

456
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,843
You want your answer,
you gotta give me the gun.

457
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,675
- What's this?
- Starburst artifact.

458
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,229
The metal from the gun
is ruining the image.

459
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,925
Show him.

460
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,607
Starburst.

461
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,075
Now, unless you think
we pre-arranged that,

462
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,693
just in case we were ever held hostage
by a guy who needs a CT,

463
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:50,275
we're not lying.

464
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,061
So you have two choices.

465
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,120
You can give me the gun
and get your answer.

466
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,600
Or you can shoot me.

467
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,300
I'm not gonna give you the gun.

468
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,275
- Why did he release you?
- House got him to give up his gun.

469
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
We just ran.

470
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,400
- Why are you still here?
- Curious.

471
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,000
It's safe now, right?

472
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,201
They're gonna be here at any moment.
Just show me the tumor.

473
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,757
There isn't one.

474
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,838
I don't know what you have.

475
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,922
So...

476
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,767
It's over.

477
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,100
Thanks for trying.

478
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,675
You had four theories.
You ruled out four theories.

479
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,700
Maybe no one can cure me.

480
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,729
He overpowered me
and got the gun back.

481
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,450
You're a coward.

482
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,300
You need to know everything
because you're afraid to be wrong.

483
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,875
You're so afraid of being ordinary,

484
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,559
of being just another doctor,
just another human being,

485
00:34:39,684 --> 00:34:41,662
that you'll risk
other people's lives.

486
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,955
I'm arrogant.
You're the coward.

487
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,791
You're terrified of death.

488
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,275
You just want to cheat it
by making it come sooner.

489
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,000
Gives you the illusion of control.

490
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Can I go?

491
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,100
Sorry.
We might need you.

492
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,200
How do they expect me to think?

493
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,800
- Is he lying?
- Why would he do that?

494
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:12,475
Over time, hostages
start to root for the captor.

495
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,654
- House isn't the rooting kind.
- No, he's the obsessive, defiant kind.

496
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:19,220
Mic the door.

497
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:20,909
Get a frame charge.

498
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:23,514
I hope your boyfriend knows
what he's doing.

499
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,465
- Are you insane?
- He's quick for a sick guy.

500
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,883
Dyspnea,

501
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:39,219
anemia, seventh-nerve palsy,

502
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,720
tachycardia.

503
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,890
Long passes.
Anything.

504
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,684
- Go.
- I don't believe it.

505
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:48,479
Chase was right.
You're gonna kill someone.

506
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:51,773
I don't want to be a part of it.

507
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:56,900
Loa loa filariasis.

508
00:35:58,226 --> 00:36:01,032
You ever been to cameroon
or on the ogowe river?

509
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,188
- Next.
- Could be Q fever

510
00:36:03,313 --> 00:36:06,000
- if he's had exposure to goats.
- No goats.

511
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,041
Histiocytosis X

512
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,206
explains the lung involvement and...

513
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:14,796
We have a new symptom.

514
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,400
He is turning his head,
favoring his left ear.

515
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,875
Means he's partially deaf
in the right.

516
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,375
Three hours ago,
he had superhero hearing.

517
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,713
Cushing's causes fatigue,
breathing problems, fluctuating hearing.

518
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:30,602
Even increased aggression
and risk-taking.

519
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:33,689
I'm doing this by choice.
It's not a symptom.

520
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,193
We'll keep that between us
till you talk to your lawyer.

521
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:42,400
I need dexamethasone

522
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,910
and enough time to provoke
a respiratory reaction

523
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,675
- and confirm Cushing's syndrome.
- You need more time?

524
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,455
House, we're not negotiating
with you.

525
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,085
- Actually, we're through negotiating.
- I've still got three hostages left.

526
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,928
I'll give you one.

527
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:00,275
And no more testing drugs
on a sick doctor.

528
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,200
Fine.

529
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,291
Send in the drugs.

530
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:12,520
Son, come here, come here.

531
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,647
House, you can't...

532
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,585
If you have Cushing's,
this will slow your breathing.

533
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,234
Give it to her first.

534
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,331
Those were not the terms.

535
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,626
I lied.

536
00:37:35,526 --> 00:37:37,335
These drugs could be fake.

537
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,664
Why would I do that?
I gave you back the gun!

538
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,575
You wouldn't.
They would.

539
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,100
She has Huntington's.

540
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:46,304
If these drugs are real,
it could screw up her liver.

541
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,875
Chances are slim.
Chances of him shooting one of us,

542
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,726
- on the other hand...
- Don't do...

543
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:04,173
How long do you have to live?

544
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,300
Eight, ten years.

545
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,579
Killing her is your chance
to get personal?

546
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:12,518
Huntington's doesn't have...

547
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:15,000
Doesn't have a cure?

548
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,875
So if we get out of here...

549
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,475
If she were clinging to hope,
she wouldn't be standing in line

550
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,575
waiting for you
to order up more drugs.

551
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,171
Take a deep breath.

552
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,417
Not knowing what was wrong
with me...

553
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,500
Made me miserable.

554
00:38:43,396 --> 00:38:44,722
Maybe that's insane.

555
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,268
Doing this...

556
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:50,243
Insane.

557
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,000
But I had something to gain.

558
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,900
You can't take risks
with no upside at all.

559
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,175
I can't decide which is riskier,
taking crazy risks

560
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,000
or taking advice on crazy risks
from a crazed risk-taker.

561
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,071
Heart's racing.

562
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,159
Fever.

563
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:16,829
And your breathing's unchanged.

564
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:20,731
- That means...
- Means I was wrong.

565
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,122
Her kidneys are shutting down
because of the meds you made her take.

566
00:39:35,276 --> 00:39:37,164
We have to get her out of here.

567
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,544
The dexamethasone

568
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:44,130
is making 13's kidneys fail,
but not the patient's. Why?

569
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,675
He's been
on 50 different medications.

570
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,675
Maybe his kidneys should be failing,
but something's protecting them.

571
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,443
I need to slap you.

572
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:54,200
For diagnostic purposes.

573
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,270
Seriously.
If I was jerking you around,

574
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,735
I'd say I needed to kick you
in the groin.

575
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:10,362
That twitch is Chvostek's sign.

576
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:13,475
Don't ask me how Chvostek
discovered it.

577
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,075
He has calcium deficiency.

578
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,705
Drugs that block calcium

579
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,483
tend to shield
against kidney damage.

580
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:21,592
He's been on protein pump inhibitors
for years for his stomach pain.

581
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:24,399
Those drugs have been protecting
his kidneys for years.

582
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,575
He has something that has
a long incubation period.

583
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,575
Something that should have
wrecked his kidneys.

584
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,511
Something that explains
breathing problems,

585
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,829
heart problems, jumpy nerves,
and weak blood.

586
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,644
- Leishmaniasis.
- Would make perfect sense

587
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:41,813
if our patient was
an arabian bedouin.

588
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,815
Melioidosis.

589
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,151
Bacteria gets into the lungs,
spreads to the heart.

590
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,275
- It explains everything.
- Except that if you read the history,

591
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,983
you'd know that our patient
has never been to a tropical climate!

592
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:55,075
Is he absolutely sure of that?
Mexico. Costa rica.

593
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:58,200
- You've never been-
- I've never been south of Florida.

594
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,159
You idiot.

595
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:07,005
Florida counts?

596
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,391
Well, not to the supreme court.

597
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,718
But it's warm enough for germs.

598
00:41:12,877 --> 00:41:14,900
You keep blaming doctors

599
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,840
when you can't even give
a halfway decent history.

600
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,435
Negotiation's over.

601
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,523
It will be as soon as you get us
three grams of ceftazidime.

602
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:28,381
He comes out, he gets
all the medicine he wants.

603
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,694
You can have Dr. House.

604
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,285
- Why are you getting rid of me?
- I need to trade you for the answer.

605
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,721
- You're gonna give her the meds.
- No...

606
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:46,945
Come on, give 'em to me instead.

607
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,100
She's taken everything I've taken.

608
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:54,301
The combination of meds
could knock me out.

609
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:55,720
Her kidneys are failing.

610
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,347
You give her those drugs,

611
00:41:57,517 --> 00:41:59,775
she'll be dead by the time
they get the cuffs on you.

612
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,186
- I need my answer.
- Your obsession is gonna kill her!

613
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:05,600
Your obsession gave me back the gun!

614
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,675
It is pointless
to give her those drugs.

615
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,207
Even if they are screwing with you,
this is your last diagnosis.

616
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:12,683
Only if you're right.

617
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,144
House, get out of here.

618
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:17,534
Shut up.
I'm not leaving.

619
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:20,287
Who's the martyr now?

620
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:23,075
Either the drugs kill me
or he kills me.

621
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,291
Doesn't seem to make
a lot of difference.

622
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:57,115
You really don't feel bad
about killing me?

623
00:42:57,484 --> 00:42:59,784
Not if you don't feel bad
about killing yourself.

624
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,500
- I don't want to die.
- Yeah, you do.

625
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,749
You just don't have the nerve
to actually do it.

626
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,300
You just want it out of your control.
Well, it is.

627
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,219
'cause I've got a gun.

628
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,900
- Don't do this.
- Either I do this with you alive, or...

629
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:33,002
Please.

630
00:43:33,348 --> 00:43:35,648
Sometimes you just have
to trust people.

631
00:44:02,492 --> 00:44:03,920
I don't want to die!

632
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,748
I don't want to die!

633
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,661
Why are you still alive?

634
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,844
He didn't make me take it.

635
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,300
A week of temporary dialysis,
your kidneys will be okay.

636
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:50,515
I'm sorry I backed out
of the differential.

637
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,800
About that Huntington's
drug trial...

638
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
Test confirmed melioidosis.

639
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,367
Easy to miss on a stain.

640
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,200
- Scans and x-rays vary widely.
- Is that all you care about?

641
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,275
A moron storms the clinic,

642
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,475
bullies his way
into life without parole,

643
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,538
you enabling him every step.

644
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,360
If he hadn't done what he did,

645
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,848
he'd be dead.

646
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,700
Good thing you enabled
my every medical move.

647
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:05,187
You think I handled this
differently because you were in here?

648
00:48:05,312 --> 00:48:07,592
I don't know.
Let's try it again without me.

649
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,515
This is why you and I
can't be a... thing.

650
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,375
If you're suggesting
that you screwed up

651
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,200
because of a non-relationship
with me,

652
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,300
I don't know how I can help you.

653
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,500
'cause the only change you can make
from a non-relationship is...

654
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,444
You want a relationship?

655
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,693
God, no.

656
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,997
Just trying to follow your logic.
