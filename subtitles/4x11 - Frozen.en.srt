1
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,596
Doc! Help! Doc!

2
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,719
It stopped bleeding.
It stopped bleeding.

3
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:31,518
That's because your blood is
freezing as it's hitting the air.

4
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,020
Here. Apply pressure on it.

5
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,493
I think my leg is frozen.

6
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,156
That's the least of your problems.
The blade severed your femoral artery.

7
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,300
Am I going to lose my leg?

8
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,605
Frostbite's not too bad.

9
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,705
But I've got to fix your artery
now. This is going to hurt.

10
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,147
Are you going to put that in me?

11
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,851
Glue's the best way to repair
your artery at this temperature.

12
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,722
It looks okay.

13
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,196
Here. Tear off some pieces.
I have to check your foot.

14
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,139
Blood flow looks good.
Your leg should be okay.

15
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,502
I thought I was done.

16
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,513
Yeah, like I'd let
anything happen to you.

17
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,446
You're the only one who
could fix the generators.

18
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,814
Okay. One, two...

19
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,649
Cate. Cate, are you okay? Are you okay?

20
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,357
Hey.

21
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,832
I need help.

22
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,101
Who am I supposed to get?

23
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,258
Why do I even give you an office?

24
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,795
New case. Psych department
asked for you personally.

25
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,158
The patient's a crazy person?

26
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,596
You're a crazy person.

27
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,927
The patient's a psychiatrist.

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,729
There's something wrong
with coma guy's cable.

29
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,597
He seems fine with it.

30
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,638
Your patient is an adjunct faculty
member here, but currently...

31
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,778
The budget committee voted to charge
for cable in the patient rooms.

32
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,510
Slippery slope.

33
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,984
Today, we withhold porn.
Tomorrow, it's clean bandages.

34
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,954
Talk to Carlson in Derm, he
runs the budget committee,

35
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,547
after you look at this.

36
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,185
After you talk to Carlson, maybe I'II...

37
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,626
The patient is trapped
at the South Pole.

38
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,701
Any possibility of evacuating her?

39
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,241
Well, that wouldn't be any fun.

40
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:41,006
And for the next two months, winds make
it impossible to fly anything in or out.

41
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,911
Could be appendicitis or a gallstone.

42
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,313
Or a kidney stone.

43
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,249
That wouldn't be any fun.

44
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,483
If it's appendicitis down there,
her appendix ruptures, she dies.

45
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,785
There's nothing we can do. If
it's a stone, she takes pain meds,

46
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,758
stone passes. There's
nothing we need to do.

47
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,760
Could be a struvite kidney stone.

48
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,821
Most kidney stones are calcium and benign.
Why would you suspect a struvite stone?

49
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,924
Because he said kidney
stones were boring.

50
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,833
It's possible. She's on birth control.

51
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,168
Lots of sex could lead to
urinary tract infection,

52
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,731
which could lead to an
infection-laced struvite kidney stone.

53
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,106
Excessive Antarctic drilling,

54
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,579
bad for the environment and the ladies.

55
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,615
If it's a struvite stone, she
needs to break it up quickly

56
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,377
before the infection
shuts down her kidneys.

57
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,112
This is where it gets fun.

58
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,088
These are the supplies and
medications she has available.

59
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,718
Nothing here that could
break up a kidney stone.

60
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,724
What else do they have down there?

61
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,163
I just said... I don't mean
medical stuff. Other stuff.

62
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,461
Some geological equipment
breaks ice and rock

63
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,902
the same way we break kidney stones.

64
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,212
Discovery Channel. I like
watching them blow stuff up.

65
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,747
Who doesn't?

66
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,442
That reminds me.

67
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,042
<i>Coma guy needs cable.</i>

68
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,652
Women's billiards is the only
thing that's keeping him alive.

69
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,283
I'm sure Carlson will
be moved by his plight.

70
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,519
Carlson won't listen. He
says I hit on his wife.

71
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,792
You knew? God, no.

72
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,659
I thought I was hitting on his daughter.

73
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,493
Look, you're on the
committee. He'll listen to you.

74
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,331
I'm an avid reader of Committees
with Hotties message boards.

75
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,132
Amoxicillin, 500 milligrams, IV.

76
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,938
Studies conducted at major hospitals
indicate that happy patients recover faster.

77
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,104
Studies conducted in my apartment
show that TV makes people happy.

78
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,546
Premium channels have a
particularly striking effect.

79
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,516
Charging patients for cable is
bringing in 13 grand a month.

80
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:31,716
Until this injustice is righted,
I am going to waste 13 grand a day.

81
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,558
That's $2.49 down.

82
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,328
Get an EKG and a cardiac enzyme.

83
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,300
If those check out, discharge him,
and tell him to get a snow-blower.

84
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,701
How much is 13 grand divided by 4 cents?

85
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,471
I am not giving you cable.

86
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,409
You're gonna have to somehow survive
with the broadcast networks alone.

87
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,571
I'll be fine on Tuesdays.

88
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,017
If sound waves from the
flaw detector break the egg,

89
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,212
it should safely dissolve
your kidney stone.

90
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,855
<i>This isn't going to work.</i>

91
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,190
Well, there's no reason it shouldn't.

92
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,527
Sound waves are sound
waves. Stones are stones.

93
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,658
<i>Some are bigger than
others. Some are inside me.</i>

94
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,033
How's it going, Team MacGyver?

95
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,366
Oh, great.

96
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,772
I can't get cable, but I can
get the South Pole on high-def.

97
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,274
We're almost ready to start the test.

98
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,005
Test? Did Ford test the Edsel?

99
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:32,446
<i>Did Coke test New Coke? Did Shakespeare
test his final play, Snow Dogs?</i>

100
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,850
<i>I'm guessing you're Dr. House?</i>

101
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,921
<i>I was wondering when you might drop by.</i>

102
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,851
Could she see me?

103
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,087
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

104
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,491
You think Jagger shows
up for the sound check?

105
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,899
Okay, roadies, off the stage.

106
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,569
Go help Cameron in the ER.

107
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,130
Why? No way you're
just doing her a favor.

108
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,800
ER is standing room only.

109
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,377
Which means Cameron's
bound to make a mistake.

110
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,312
Find it so I can blackmail her.

111
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,708
As far as you know,

112
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,446
this is way more than just
some silly battle over cable.

113
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,790
<i>Ready.</i>

114
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,553
You might wanna dial it down a smidge.

115
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,718
<i>I am not doing this.</i>

116
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,356
<i>Your kidney stone theory hinges
on me having sex, but I...</i>

117
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,057
Let me guess. You're as
pure as the driven snow.

118
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,962
<i>Only if the snow likes to be on top.</i>

119
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,067
<i>But I am here doing
psychological research.</i>

120
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,196
<i>Generally not a good idea to
swap fluids with your subjects.</i>

121
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,674
Struvite stones are possible
in people who don't have sex.

122
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,974
They're certainly possible
in people who claim not to...

123
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,482
I've had no UTI's, no pain on urination.

124
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,144
You do realize that only
one of us is a real doctor.

125
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,120
<i>You do realize only one of us
has any control over my actions.</i>

126
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,922
Dr. Milton, are you
able to run a CHEM-7?

127
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,018
<i>Yes.</i>

128
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,960
Well, that'd tell us if her
kidney function is declining.

129
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,661
If it is, he's right.

130
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,927
Struvite stone's the
most likely explanation.

131
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,866
If not, she's right.

132
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,541
Sorry. I know how you like to
avoid avoiding confrontation.

133
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,911
While we're waiting for that test to
prove me right, start IV cefuroxime.

134
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,575
Keep the infection in the stone
from wiping out your kidneys.

135
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,846
<i>I'll send the CHEM-7
results when I'm done.</i>

136
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,552
She's a great psychiatrist.
One session, I've got shrinkage.

137
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,157
House wants us to spy
on you, report back.

138
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,595
And you're telling me this because...

139
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,193
We don't want to do it.

140
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,431
I don't see a problem so far.

141
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,440
If our choice is between pissing
House off or pissing you off,

142
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,100
that's not much of a choice.

143
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,644
So unless I give House cable,

144
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,542
you're gonna make my life miserable.

145
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,173
Yes.

146
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,241
And you're telling me this so you
won't feel as guilty when you do it.

147
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,515
Yes.

148
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,554
Accommodating House's every
whim is not my job anymore.

149
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,218
But it is ours.

150
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,393
House will get what he wants.

151
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,496
Maybe we should just pay for it
ourselves and tell him she folded.

152
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,101
No.

153
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:49,538
Your CHEM-7 results showed your
kidney function is declining.

154
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,980
Sounds like a kidney stone to me.

155
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,573
<i>The decreased function</i>

156
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,588
<i>could be from dehydration caused
by vomiting due to a gallstone.</i>

157
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,989
You agreed that the CHEM-7 would
decide if it was a struvite stone.

158
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,721
I agreed to do the test. The
results are up for interpretation.

159
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,230
I'll re-do the test in an
hour when I'm re-hydrated.

160
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,893
Have you noticed any improvement
since starting the cefuroxime?

161
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,368
<i>Not really. Pain's about the same.</i>

162
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,064
While you're waiting, we
should run another test

163
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,231
with the geology equipment.

164
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,739
You're not taking the cefuroxime.

165
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,272
She's right-handed.

166
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,972
Means she would put
the IV in her left arm.

167
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,014
Catheter in the arm makes
it hard to bend the elbow,

168
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,343
the way people do when they drink.

169
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,113
We have a limited supply of medication,
and I am not about to waste it.

170
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,246
Last I checked you had a
limited supply of doctors.

171
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:35,021
<i>Right before I got sick, one of my
crew members severed his femoral artery.</i>

172
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,424
<i>He needs the cefuroxime.</i>

173
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,792
<i>Right. He called dibs.</i>

174
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,129
His need is definitive.
Mine is speculative.

175
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,033
You're breathing fast.

176
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,660
<i>It's because I'm pissed off!</i>

177
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,706
Lift up your chin.
Show me your windpipe.

178
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,435
<i>My chest hurts.</i>

179
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,604
It's deviating to the left.

180
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,011
Because her right lung is collapsing.

181
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,845
Cate, is anyone there with you?

182
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,440
<i>Sean went to the mess.
You need to call someone.</i>

183
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,679
There's no time. Get
a syringe and a needle.

184
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,345
<i>Why am I doing that? Shut up and look.</i>

185
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,056
She could pass out. She needs to...

186
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,423
She needs to re-inflate that lung.

187
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,953
Okay. Now, pull out the plunger.

188
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,055
I want you to stab
yourself in your right side

189
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,032
between the second and third
rib, in the midclavicular line.

190
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,204
By the time we get someone else
there, you'll have suffocated.

191
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,567
<i>Just do it.</i>

192
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,249
See all the good stuff that
happens when you listen to me?

193
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,617
<i>Means it's not a kidney stone.</i>

194
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,028
<i>Right side pain, vomiting,</i>

195
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,439
<i>and now a lung that gets
traumatized without any trauma.</i>

196
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,204
<i>Sounds odd. Probably is odd.</i>

197
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,143
<i>We should discuss this,
then call her back.</i>

198
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,308
No, it's fine. I made sure we got
the South Pole long distance plan.

199
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,408
Her latest kidney function test shows...

200
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,317
<i>I know what it shows. I ran it.</i>

201
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,117
The more you interrupt, the longer
my grandstanding is going to take.

202
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,658
Since when do you let patients
participate in differentials?

203
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,228
Since the patient and her doctor
happen to be the same person.

204
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,989
<i>Your kidney function is still declining.
Means you have a kidney problem.</i>

205
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,467
But not one that needed
antibiotics. Makes us equally wrong.

206
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,733
No. Makes us both wrong. Not equally.

207
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,667
You were at least six wronger.

208
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,577
They run a PPD before you shipped out?

209
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,579
<i>On me and everybody
else here. It's not TB.</i>

210
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,478
<i>Excuse us a second.</i>

211
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,614
Cancer explains her symptoms.

212
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,779
A tumor in her lung or kidney that
threw a clot to the other organ.

213
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,416
And you're worried the tumor might
overhear, realize we're on to it.

214
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,791
Cancer's a hard diagnosis for patients,
even when they're not in the South Pole.

215
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,126
We should figure this
out, maybe bring Wilson in.

216
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,168
<i>Obviously, you two
think I'm in bad shape.</i>

217
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,365
Only if you count the tumor. House.

218
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,965
Probably in your abdomen.

219
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,375
<i>But you don't have any
advanced imaging equipment.</i>

220
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,139
<i>You also don't have a
surgeon to biopsy it,</i>

221
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,079
<i>any stains to use on the slide,</i>

222
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,083
<i>or an oncologist to analyze it.</i>

223
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,577
<i>I'm too far away to hold her hand.</i>

224
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,613
<i>I have cancer?</i>

225
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,380
Possibly.

226
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,688
Since the only imaging equipment
you have is x-ray, let's start there.

227
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,820
X
- ray your entire body.

228
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,165
<i>I'll upload the images when I'm done.</i>

229
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,628
Good for you.

230
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,523
<i>She's annoying.</i>

231
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,368
Refused to take the antibiotics
because other people might need them.

232
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,201
She said she cares about other people?

233
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,468
What a poser.

234
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,509
KUB is clean.

235
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,637
You don't like her because
she's a psychiatrist.

236
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,910
Mmm, I'm a complicated man.
I loathe her for many reasons.

237
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,144
Never before has a
profession been so decried

238
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,210
by someone who needed it so badly.

239
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,484
You talk a lot of smack
about tranny hookers.

240
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,354
Enlarged mediastinal node.

241
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,484
Lymphoma? Probably,

242
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,551
but we can't confirm
it without a biopsy.

243
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,255
We can't analyze a
biopsy without a stain.

244
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,525
We can't biopsy.

245
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,397
Since they don't have stains
down there, we need a substitute.

246
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,903
She can't biopsy that node
without a surgical team and an OR.

247
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,441
Anything with a strong
color could work as a stain.

248
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,510
Printer ink, food coloring, coffee.

249
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,704
No, thanks.

250
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,214
I'll find a node closer to the
surface. One she can biopsy.

251
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,274
That makes sense.

252
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,375
That makes sense?

253
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,680
I said it first.

254
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,119
In a shockingly calm manner.

255
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,854
After I've just been jerking
you around for 30 seconds

256
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,554
without you complaining
or analyzing said jerking.

257
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,994
I was being mature.

258
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,231
In a lavender shirt.

259
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,224
You, for some reason, are happy.

260
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,860
How dare you.

261
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,235
The x-rays don't show
any other abnormal nodes.

262
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,436
Abnormal nodes can be felt before
they can be seen on an x-ray.

263
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,741
You're wearing that shirt for someone.

264
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,281
The Health Department. They
frown on topless oncology.

265
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,713
You're gonna do a physical?

266
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,219
Have to. You and Foreman are going
to be here looking for a stain.

267
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,355
I can do the physical. There's
no reason you need to watch.

268
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,091
I can think of at least three reasons.

269
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,493
<i>One of them is medical.</i>

270
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,565
Where are you? Not in your office.

271
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,657
You're not in the hospital.
No reason for me to be.

272
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,828
I'm not undressing for
you in your apartment.

273
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,235
<i>You're not in my apartment.</i>

274
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,337
You're three quarters of a world away.

275
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,242
<i>I promise not to get fresh.</i>

276
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,710
I'm not taking off my clothes.

277
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,806
One of us has to.

278
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,784
Show me your place.

279
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,086
It's got walls, a floor,
and in some places, a roof.

280
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,324
<i>I am not exposing myself
without some reciprocity.</i>

281
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,092
It's my apartment. It's not my soul.

282
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,128
<i>Living room.</i>

283
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,929
Slow down.

284
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,398
<i>Huh!</i>

285
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,504
Lots of books. I'm betting all medical.

286
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:32,050
<i>Only if you count Jenna Jameson's
autobiography as a gynecological text.</i>

287
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,709
Fiction is a waste of time.

288
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,643
Unless you can laugh at it?

289
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,882
<i>I love to laugh. Moving on.</i>

290
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,114
Back up.

291
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,159
<i>How bad is the insomnia?</i>

292
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,726
<i>Let me quantify that.</i>

293
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:51,565
<i>Do you drink two or three scotches
before passing out in front of the TV?</i>

294
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,629
You are so far off.

295
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,468
<i>It's bourbon.</i>

296
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,736
<i>No photos anywhere.</i>

297
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,809
Family and friends aren't important?

298
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,341
Well, you're sick.

299
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,543
You have 20 people down the hall,
and you've had exactly one visitor.

300
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,983
<i>I don't want to panic anyone.</i>

301
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,489
You don't like people. You
hide on that ice cube, so...

302
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:17,189
<i>Stop projecting. You're antisocial,
so you assume I'm antisocial?</i>

303
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,526
How about if I just get
naked, and you shut up?

304
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,429
<i>If I thought I could get you
naked, I would have led with that.</i>

305
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,696
<i>You'd rather show me
your soul than your leg.</i>

306
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,169
Great. You got me all figured out.

307
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,400
You going to try and fix me now?

308
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,646
<i>I never said you needed fixing.</i>

309
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,810
He's letting her take
part in the differentials.

310
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,514
Of course he is. He likes her.

311
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,116
Big shock. Spaghetti sauce doesn't
work as a lymph tissue stain.

312
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,325
I'll try the coffee.

313
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,421
He's annoyed by her, doesn't
respect her as a doctor,

314
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,159
constantly insults her.

315
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,930
That's House's version of courtship.

316
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,034
Oh, God. He's been wooing me for years.

317
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,664
She's the perfect woman for him.

318
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,608
Willing to literally go to the
end of the earth for her career,

319
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,544
making her unavailable
for a real relationship.

320
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,082
And she's afflicted with
a mysterious illness.

321
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,117
Soy sauce is a no-go.

322
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,318
We're gonna be here all night.

323
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,180
How long does it take you to get naked?

324
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,088
<i>It's the South Pole.</i>

325
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,888
I wear a lot of layers.

326
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,228
<i>Okay. Ready.</i>

327
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,232
I saw socks.

328
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,528
That's not naked.

329
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,795
Have I mentioned it's freezing here?

330
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,534
<i>When they discover lymph nodes
in feet, I will take off my socks.</i>

331
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,436
Use your right hand
to palpate the nodes.

332
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,112
Any node you can feel
is the one we can biopsy.

333
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,775
Let's start with your breasts,
move down to the ass, then...

334
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,081
<i>I was thinking go from the
neck and work my way down.</i>

335
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,917
We could,

336
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,083
but I'd never forgive myself if we found
something before we got to your breasts.

337
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,256
I'm starting with the
anterior cervical nodes.

338
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,998
Turn your head.

339
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,231
Locate the SCM muscle.

340
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,900
<i>I know how to find my lymph nodes.</i>

341
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:15,208
Did they teach you that before or after
the class on fondling your inner child?

342
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,974
<i>No swelling. No tenderness. And...</i>

343
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,511
<i>I can hear that, House.</i>

344
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,418
Just thought it might help you relax.

345
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,521
Anything in the axillary nodes?

346
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,320
All clear.

347
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,055
Both sides.

348
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,493
Now slide your hand to your sternum.

349
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,663
Probe for nodes moving slowly downward.

350
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,265
<i>Down to what, House?</i>

351
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,438
<i>Sorry. Can't hear you on
account of your heavy breathing.</i>

352
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,174
<i>I'm supposed to be on oxygen, you tool.</i>

353
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,382
Hold it.

354
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,549
Your fingers didn't go quite
as deep. Feel that node again.

355
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,556
<i>It's swollen.</i>

356
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,897
Looks like you're doing a biopsy.

357
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,242
<i>It's pretty numb.</i>

358
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:26,648
Okay. Take a deep breath and
insert the needle into the node.

359
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,155
Come on, Cate. Let's get this over with.

360
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,821
You used her name.

361
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,824
Just trying to move things along, Bob.

362
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,464
Okay. I'm in.

363
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,635
You need to pull back on the syringe.

364
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:56,905
You need to pull harder.

365
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,991
You okay?

366
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,855
Yeah.

367
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,590
"Are you okay?"

368
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,860
It's a valid medical question.

369
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,367
I have never heard you ask
a patient that question.

370
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,698
You've never asked me that question,

371
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:23,639
and you've seen me fall down
a flight of stairs drunk.

372
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,802
You've slept with her.

373
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,936
She's 9,000 miles away.

374
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,441
And while a certain
part of me, unfurled...

375
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,005
No, I...

376
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,553
Somehow, you've been intimate with her.

377
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,019
Why are you following me?

378
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,981
I thought you were following me.

379
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,649
No. You are definitely following me.

380
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,284
Where are you going? Out to lunch.

381
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,521
You never go out to lunch.

382
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,186
Which means there's a reason
you're going out to lunch.

383
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,026
I assume that reason is a human being.

384
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,360
Or a sandwich.

385
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,559
Sandwiches can come here.

386
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,896
So can human beings.

387
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,834
And yet, she's not,
which I find interesting.

388
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,132
I'm leaving, now.

389
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,072
Small world.

390
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,544
Are you going to follow me into my car?

391
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,711
It's got two doors.

392
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:05,408
Okay, look, the reason
I haven't told you is...

393
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,749
Call off your dogs, House.

394
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,554
Your little helpers are
interrogating my patients,

395
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,992
swiping my charts,
intercepting prescriptions.

396
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,087
Why would you think that I...

397
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,426
Because I'm not a moron.

398
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,762
You had to be pulling the strings, here.

399
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,165
You think that because
they make me miserable,

400
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,601
I'm going to give you cable.

401
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,635
Let's assume that's true,

402
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,535
and it certainly
sounds like it might be.

403
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,166
What are you going to do? Nothing.

404
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,904
I resigned from the budget committee.

405
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,447
I only joined the committee to help
the hospital. You made me a liability.

406
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,779
I now have zero influence over
the hospital's cable policy.

407
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,592
Well done.

408
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,561
It didn't work. There's
nothing more that we can do...

409
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,190
Put these up.

410
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,025
"Free rottweiler puppies.

411
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,129
"Please call after 11:00 p.m.
And before 5:00 a.m."

412
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,263
Is this Cameron's home number?

413
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,240
I'd love a new puppy.

414
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,607
My last one was delicious, very tender.

415
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,236
There's no point in torturing her.

416
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,942
If she can resign, she can
un-resign. Go to DEFCON 1.

417
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,950
Forget waiting for a
mistake. Make her make one.

418
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,543
You want us to sabotage another doctor,

419
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,385
possibly harm a patient,
all so you can have cable.

420
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,588
Harm suggests permanent damage.
Get her to screw up, then fix it.

421
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,027
Oh! And this time,

422
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,098
don't tell her what you're
gonna do before you do it.

423
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:34,671
So, how long do I let the lymph
node marinate in the red wine?

424
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,032
It should be ready, now.

425
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,576
Try increasing the
magnification on the camera.

426
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,640
<i>You know, I emailed a couple of
colleagues at the hospital about you.</i>

427
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,446
You're checking up on me? Not House?

428
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,358
Yeah, well House is straightforward,
brilliant and an ass.

429
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,825
Two out of three good
qualities. Clear majority.

430
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:00,659
Whereas you, on the other
hand, have a perfect score.

431
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:04,531
You are responsible, nice, human.

432
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,595
And yet, you're House's best friend.

433
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,098
<i>Hold there.</i>

434
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,867
Makes you think he's
secretly nicer than he seems?

435
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,537
<i>Makes me think that you're secretly
a lot less nice than you seem.</i>

436
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,170
<i>Do you always insult your doctors?</i>

437
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:20,047
It's not an insult. Indiscriminate
niceness is overrated.

438
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,044
No wonder he likes you.

439
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,518
Based on this slide
you do not have cancer.

440
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,796
Oh!

441
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,888
Thank God.

442
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,229
I do see some inflammation,
which could mean...

443
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:38,868
Cate?

444
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,994
You all right?

445
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,005
My left side. It hurts.

446
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,801
It's the same pain
that I had on the right.

447
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,139
Your other kidney.

448
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,340
No. I hope it's, it's
something, it's maybe...

449
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,575
I'm screwed.

450
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:03,788
<i>The bad news is you're O for
two in the kidney department.</i>

451
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,263
Is there good news? You're back at home.

452
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,699
Of course. There's cable.

453
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,099
<i>And freedom to work pant-free.</i>

454
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,398
That is good news.

455
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,305
Wilson found signs of
inflammation in your biopsy.

456
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,404
That, plus the two failing kidneys,
points to autoimmune disease.

457
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:24,141
Probably SLE or vasculitis.
Treatment for both is prednisone.

458
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,648
Start with a hundred milligrams.

459
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,514
Autoimmune is just your latest theory.

460
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,247
Like cancer before that,
and a kidney stone before.

461
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,519
<i>Take the prednisone. You'll get
better. That will be your confirmation.</i>

462
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,855
You practice medicine
like it's a fire sale.

463
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,293
You've wasted antibiotics, x-rays...

464
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,623
That was not a waste. We've ruled out...

465
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,496
We have a crew member
here who has asthma.

466
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,628
If he has an episode after I've
used up the prednisone, he'll die.

467
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,332
There's a good chance
he's going to die anyway.

468
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,998
Since there won't be a
doctor there to help him.

469
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,373
<i>Show me proof that it's autoimmune,</i>

470
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,940
<i>and then I'll take the prednisone.</i>

471
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,688
We should send her outside.

472
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,951
Right. Let's just tell her to head
north until she runs into a hospital.

473
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,119
Autoimmune diseases are basically
inflammation running wild.

474
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,892
Extreme cold has been used as treatment,
like putting ice on a sprained ankle.

475
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,900
She starts to feel better
outside, we know it's autoimmune.

476
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,492
Is that my wallet?

477
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,867
You can have it back.

478
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,233
I've already been through it.

479
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,435
I like your ice on the sprain metaphor.

480
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,499
Makes it seem like
we're not killing her.

481
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,306
She'd only need to be
outside five minutes.

482
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,678
Without her mittens. Mom
told me that was a bad idea.

483
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,310
Especially that winter. It was 70
below, and I had dual kidney failure.

484
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:38,755
This is a good idea. It's perfect
for you. Experimental, risky.

485
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,484
Wilson's right. You care about...

486
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,322
You didn't touch the cash,
but you took the receipts?

487
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:51,097
A hundred and ninety dollar restaurant
tab. That's dessert, probably booze.

488
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,260
It means you lingered.

489
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,430
Means it's at least
a third date. Means...

490
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,440
Where are you going? To
talk to the people I pay

491
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,804
to come up with medical ideas.

492
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,868
There are no ideas.

493
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,606
The test for autoimmune is ANA.

494
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,841
Unless penguins poop immunoanalyzers...

495
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,440
Before ANA testing,

496
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,917
people had autoimmune diseases.

497
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,385
How did they know?

498
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,355
C3. Before that.

499
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,916
LE Prep. But she doesn't have
any controlled pore glass beads.

500
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,927
You don't need them.

501
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,229
<i>When you shake the test tube,</i>

502
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,066
<i>the paperclip will damage
some of your blood cells.</i>

503
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,469
<i>If you have an autoimmune disease,</i>

504
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,269
<i>your immune system will gorge
itself on the damaged cells.</i>

505
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,470
They'll get big and fat so that
you can see them under a microscope.

506
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,469
How you doing?

507
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,905
<i>No change.</i>

508
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:42,749
<i>So, how long should I give the cells
to fatten up before I check them?</i>

509
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,448
A couple hours.

510
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,047
Or you could stop being a hypocrite
and take the prednisone now.

511
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,719
<i>Not bending to your will
makes me a hypocrite?</i>

512
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,890
If your psych patients demanded lab
results you'd never make a diagnosis.

513
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,159
So, I'm wrong.

514
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,429
You sleep like a baby. Your
life is unfolding as you dreamed.

515
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,471
Everyone is miserable.

516
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,563
You don't change that
because people don't change.

517
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,664
You want to believe that

518
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,403
because then you're freed from
any responsibility for your misery.

519
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,002
Oh, shut up.

520
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,346
I get enough of this from Wilson.

521
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,847
And yet, you keep hanging out with him.

522
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:19,083
<i>And, from what I hear, you have spent more
time with me than with any other patient.</i>

523
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,291
Sorry about that.

524
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,030
Call me when you get the results.

525
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,269
How's your patient?

526
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,669
She has an autoimmune disease.

527
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,300
Tell the psych department
she's in denial.

528
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,042
I had to fire Cameron.

529
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,174
What? What happened?

530
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,720
A sixty-five-year-old man came
into the ER with a hip fracture.

531
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,789
Cameron gave him Demerol.

532
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,346
The guy was on an MAOl.

533
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,016
Put him into a hypertensive crisis.

534
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,151
Is he going to live?

535
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,626
Taub caught the error in time.

536
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,054
If she'd just admitted the mistake,

537
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,326
maybe I could have just
suspended her, but...

538
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,629
She's packing up. If
you want to say goodbye.

539
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,728
We should be hearing from the
South Pole in a few minutes.

540
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
That's it?

541
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,041
There's nothing to be done.

542
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,873
She screwed up. She's got
no one to blame but herself.

543
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,839
I've got to go talk to Cameron.

544
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,476
Cuddy wouldn't can
her for one screw-up.

545
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,578
And if she did, she wouldn't come to me.

546
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,883
And if she did, she wouldn't
open with, "How's your patient?"

547
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,754
And if she did... Why would she lie?

548
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,817
Timeless question.

549
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,692
In this case, she conspired
with your co-workers to teach me

550
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,062
that some things are
more important than cable.

551
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,066
I'm going to have to teach
them that they're wrong.

552
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,228
Come on. South Pole
really should be calling.

553
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:47,036
LE Prep test was negative.
It's not autoimmune.

554
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:51,212
You're basing that on a test done with
a paper clip. Just take the prednisone.

555
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:55,117
Either find another diagnosis,
or find another test.

556
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,915
There is one way.

557
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:02,121
You can take this experimental
drug called prednisone.

558
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,223
<i>If your kidneys start working...</i>

559
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,887
<i>There is another test.</i>

560
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,629
I think Foreman may have
just broken up, there.

561
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,636
What he actually said was,
"There is no other test. "

562
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,399
If you have an autoimmune disease,

563
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,964
exposure to the cold should
decrease your kidney pain.

564
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,806
<i>If I go outside, we'll have our answer?</i>

565
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,875
<i>And you knew about this?</i>

566
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,507
I rejected it because
if you're frozen solid,

567
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,676
<i>it's hard to get the
needles into your arms.</i>

568
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,185
How long do I need to stay out?

569
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,312
At least five minutes.

570
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,946
Eight minutes outside
would kill a healthy person.

571
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,922
<i>And healthy people don't
suck on oxygen masks.</i>

572
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,585
<i>Healthy people can pee.</i>

573
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,629
I'll go get Sean, have him come with me.

574
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,960
Just take the prednisone.

575
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,259
<i>Once I come inside,</i>

576
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,132
if it's autoimmune.

577
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,904
Are you all right?

578
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,371
<i>Oh, I'm sure she's just fine.</i>

579
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,477
Cate?

580
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,808
Do you know if there's anyone
down there who has a cell phone?

581
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,259
<i>It took the station mechanic
20 minutes to respond.</i>

582
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,266
She'd already slipped into a coma.

583
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,397
Started her on prednisone,
but no improvement.

584
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,170
Means it's not autoimmune.

585
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,874
Good thing she's in a coma.

586
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,278
Or we'd have to listen to her gloat.

587
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,610
And where are we going?

588
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,581
To find the useful members of my team.

589
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,879
You're letting them off the hook?

590
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,787
<i>You happy? Because of you, I'm not gonna
be able to watch Law & Order in Korean.</i>

591
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,914
Why am I here?

592
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,686
Because I want to ask
you about your girlfriend.

593
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,388
I must know who she is, or
you'd have told me her name.

594
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,694
She doesn't have a name. It's
some sort of birth defect.

595
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,859
There's only about 12
people we both know.

596
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,664
And I can't remember
five of their names,

597
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,865
so we're down to Cuddy, your ex-wives.

598
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,407
Your mama.

599
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,773
You need to run a kidney function test.

600
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:04,109
Yes. If only she wasn't in a coma,
we could get her to run a test

601
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,580
to find out why she's in a coma.

602
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,141
The results would likely be paradoxical.

603
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,153
It can't be Cuddy, because
you're straight. It can't be...

604
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,246
We could talk the
mechanic through the test.

605
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,985
Too complicated.

606
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,786
Unless he's thirsty.

607
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:23,894
Drink her urine?

608
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,765
If it has a strong, concentrated taste,

609
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,565
it means the problems
are in her kidneys.

610
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,538
<i>Watery taste means it's her brain.</i>

611
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,435
And then you can fix it?

612
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,541
Let's say, yeah.

613
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,376
<i>How do I get the urine out of her?</i>

614
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,745
Take a straight
catheter and insert it...

615
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,283
Those are your only questions?

616
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,251
Not, "Is it safe?"

617
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,746
<i>Or, "Is there another way?"</i>

618
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,121
Or, "Are you out of your minds?"

619
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,786
You wouldn't ask me if...

620
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,493
Wait a second.

621
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,795
You're in love with her.

622
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,965
That explains why you're so eager
to get her naked, then have a drink.

623
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,333
Because most guys like to
go the other way around.

624
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,871
Why do you care how I feel about her?

625
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:07,805
Because now I know that I can get
you to do anything to save her.

626
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,939
Tell him how to tap the keg.

627
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,445
You got Cameron fired.

628
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,150
Cuddy wasn't supposed to find out.

629
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,782
No kidding!

630
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,625
Get me cable. How tough can that
be? You cost a woman her job.

631
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,265
There's only one thing you can
say to keep me from firing you.

632
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,698
Cameron wasn't fired. We...

633
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,167
Wrong.

634
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,501
You know? We're still fired?

635
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,370
That should be a hint as to
what you're supposed to say.

636
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,341
We're sorry. Wrong.

637
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,707
I love you.

638
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,571
Wrong.

639
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,848
This is a game? First, we have
to screw with our co-worker,

640
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,181
now we have to try to figure
out what you want us to say?

641
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,845
This is insane. I'm not playing.

642
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,118
Right.

643
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,952
You should have said this two days ago.

644
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,124
Do not play games with me.

645
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,030
Number one, you are going to
lose. You're just not ready.

646
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,625
Number two, the game was to
force you to stop playing games.

647
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,194
I need you to stand
up to me. Challenge me.

648
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,968
I need you to stop worrying
about getting fired.

649
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,169
And go pay for my cable.

650
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:14,970
No!

651
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,474
I didn't mean on this.

652
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,006
Seriously. I need cable.

653
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,385
Milk, milk, lemonade.

654
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,858
It tastes kind of watery.

655
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,326
That's bad news.

656
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,428
Either increased intracranial pressure

657
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,838
or something's wrong
with her hypothalamus.

658
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,500
<i>How do you figure out which one it is?</i>

659
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,510
We don't do anything.

660
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,438
You're gonna drill a hole in her skull.

661
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:57,218
<i>If she regains consciousness, it's
increased intracranial pressure.</i>

662
00:35:58,856 --> 00:35:59,880
And if it's the other thing?

663
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,521
She'll die.

664
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,526
But if it's the hypothalamus,
she's dead, anyway.

665
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,724
If the problem is the pressure
in her brain, and I fix it,

666
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:09,925
is she going to be all better?

667
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,565
No, but it'll give us more
time to figure out what's wrong.

668
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,730
<i>I have to get someone
else. I can't do this.</i>

669
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,733
You love her.

670
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,777
You'd do anything to save her.

671
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,212
Not this.

672
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,251
I can't do this.

673
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,252
If she dies because of
something that I did, then I...

674
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,981
Listen. Listen.

675
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,057
I am not going to let
you hurt her. Okay?

676
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:38,159
Now, please. This is her only chance.

677
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,997
Okay.

678
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,572
That was easy.

679
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,211
Okay. Her head is stabilized,

680
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,317
and the drill bit is sterile.

681
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,550
Place the drill bit against the
upper left part of her forehead,

682
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,956
about an inch above the temple.

683
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,175
It's not going anywhere.

684
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,975
Bone's harder than wood. Lean into it.

685
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,142
<i>The skull is only a quarter inch thick.</i>

686
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,582
Once you're midway through,
drill in shorter bursts.

687
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,147
<i>If you come out the other
side, you've gone too far.</i>

688
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,286
Okay. Now, what? Now, what?

689
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,418
Let the fluid drain.

690
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,635
She's waking up. She's waking up.

691
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,879
Sean?

692
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,318
What's going on?

693
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,821
South Pole doc is out of her coma,

694
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,925
and now we have a new symptom.

695
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,790
Increased intracranial pressure.

696
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,960
Why are we out here?

697
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,527
That's the patient room.

698
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,597
ICP plus kidney problems
plus lung collapse equals...

699
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,871
The most likely suspect is
a tumor throwing off clots.

700
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,343
We ruled out cancer.

701
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,641
But not clots.

702
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,479
What causes blood clots?

703
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:39,777
Bacterial endocarditis.

704
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,942
Not without a fever.

705
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,009
Deep vein thrombosis
plus an existing PFO.

706
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,214
PFO would have been discovered on
her pre-South Pole physical exam.

707
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,655
What if the clots aren't clots?

708
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,125
Atherosclerosis. Fatty plaque
builds up on the arterial walls.

709
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,290
Pieces break off, block blood
flow. Explains everything.

710
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:59,359
She has zero risk factors.
Forget fat. Think clots.

711
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,528
No.

712
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,939
You're standing up to me?

713
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,032
Maybe.

714
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,667
Just to clarify, you should
do that when you're right.

715
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,474
Sorry for the confusion.

716
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,344
How could a clot... Could
be a different kind of fat.

717
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,905
Fat emboli.

718
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:17,413
It's a perfect fit. Except
it's completely impossible.

719
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,982
Fat emboli requires an
un-repaired bone breakage.

720
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,424
Between the x-ray and the
exam, I've seen her entire...

721
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,693
See, that's what I'm talking about.

722
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,436
<i>Take off her socks.</i>

723
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,109
I can... I can do it.

724
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,406
No. I got it.

725
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,318
Your toe is broken.

726
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,518
Oh, my God.

727
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,588
<i>Bits of bone marrow have been
leaking into your bloodstream.</i>

728
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:04,964
<i>Those fat emboli have caused blockages
in your kidney, lungs, and brain.</i>

729
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,028
It doesn't even hurt.

730
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,799
Cold numbs everything.

731
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,568
Does a particularly great
job on the extremities.

732
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:15,134
You'll need to close the break
to stop the marrow from leaking.

733
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,577
This one you will feel.

734
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,242
<i>Will you do it?</i>

735
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:24,247
He drilled a hole in your skull after
drinking your pee. I think he's up for this.

736
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,948
Grab the tip of her toe
with your right hand.

737
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,887
Hold the break with the other.

738
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,550
On the count of three, pull hard.

739
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,786
<i>One, two,</i>

740
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,559
three.

741
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,341
Splint your toe. You'll be fine.

742
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,245
Thank you, House.

743
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,851
Don't thank me. He's the
one who saved your life.

744
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,973
He likes her.

745
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:39,192
A bottle of the Bordeaux
and some sparkling water.

746
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:48,368
Well, you didn't pick her up, which
means she's coming from work, too,

747
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,406
which means you're
comfortable enough to meet her.

748
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,601
Damn. I thought I lost
you when I walked backwards

749
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,166
through my own footprints in the snow.

750
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,305
I think I've got it narrowed
down to three possibilities.

751
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,372
Better leave. If you see
her, it'll be cheating.

752
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,711
It's not one of your ex-wives.

753
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:01,842
Because they hate me.

754
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:05,184
They don't. They should, but
they don't. I called them.

755
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,724
It's someone new, but someone I know.

756
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,816
Did you ever consider
being happy for me?

757
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,225
Briefly.

758
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,286
You ordering the wine
before she got here...

759
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,767
Girls are good, House, and you know it.

760
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,564
You solved your case because
you cared about that girl.

761
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,004
You're demonstrating the
illusion of manly confidence,

762
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,042
which means you haven't
closed the deal, yet.

763
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,237
I closed the deal. I just like her.

764
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,438
Still?

765
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,072
You knew your patient
hated having cold feet,

766
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,618
because you did a physical
exam, because you liked her.

767
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,951
Your theory is I cared, therefore
I let her keep her socks on.

768
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,685
If that's what love is, then I don't
wanna have anything to do with it.

769
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,593
It starts with warm feet,
but leads to other things.

770
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,425
Your mom and I will
explain when you're older.

771
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,625
If I'd made her take them off like
I should have, I'd have seen the toe

772
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,031
and solved the case days ago.

773
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,501
But you don't care about her.

774
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,667
Of course not. House
doesn't care about anyone.

775
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,677
Hi.

776
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,939
Sorry I'm late.

777
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,845
Cutthroat Bitch?

778
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,552
I call her Amber.

779
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,683
Was she on your list?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
