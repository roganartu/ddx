1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:04,301
Yeah, I said I'm sorry. I'm
just not feeling too hot.

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,703
You're sneezing. You could
do that in a movie theater.

3
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,569
Yeah, and I'll be in a nice
soft chair when I collapse.

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:09,767
I'm exhausted, babe.

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,310
<i>Oh, come on. We're gonna be late.</i>

6
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,175
Episode Four never
comes to the big screen.

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,304
This is the pre-Lucasized
version, remember?

8
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,940
<i>None of that Greedo shooting first crap.</i>

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,006
Go without me.

10
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,108
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,210
<i>You love Star Wars.</i>

12
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,481
Don't you?

13
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,715
Ben?

14
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,916
<i>Since when?</i>

15
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,324
Since just before I started
pretending I loved it.

16
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,556
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to be supportive.

17
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,530
Fine. I'll go alone.

18
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,304
<i>Baby, I'm sorry. Me, too.</i>

19
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,213
I'm so woozy I can hardly think.

20
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,342
We'll hang out at home.

21
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,818
No, you should go.

22
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,353
Did you just feel something?

23
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,721
Feel? Like what?

24
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,850
<i>Is there an earthquake? In New Jersey?</i>

25
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,189
<i>Oh, God. What?</i>

26
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,254
I think I'm, like, hallucinating.

27
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,102
Call 911.

28
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,455
Twenty-six year old female, gas
main exploded under her building,

29
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,426
she was pulled out of the
rubble after six hours.

30
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,836
Two surgeries for multiple
fractures and burns.

31
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,372
I'm thinking the broken bones

32
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,466
are a response to the
building falling on her head.

33
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,440
And the fever?

34
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,881
She's the only collapse victim
whose body temperature was...

35
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,679
Put her on antipyretics.

36
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,015
Already have. The
fever is holding at 104.

37
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,185
Fluctuating consciousness.

38
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,752
Can't take the case.
I don't have a team.

39
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,819
So hire a team.

40
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,661
What for? I don't have a case.

41
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,325
Have you even interviewed anybody?

42
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,199
You test-drive a car before you buy it.

43
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,635
You have sex before you get married.

44
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,697
I can't hire a team based
on a 10-minute interview.

45
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,833
What if I don't like
having sex with them?

46
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,553
You've spent the last two
weeks doing absolutely nothing.

47
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,646
Concert is over.

48
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,884
In what twisted universe

49
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,052
does mastering Eddie Van Halen's
two-handed arpeggio technique

50
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,221
count as "absolutely nothing"?

51
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,822
Take the case, or you
will spend the next month

52
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,869
helping the collapse
team change bandages.

53
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,335
I diagnose her alone, by the end
of the day, you go away for a week.

54
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,840
Done.

55
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:14,842
It's not gonna work.

56
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,548
If he solves the case, we cure the girl.

57
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,181
And prove he doesn't need a team.

58
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,089
He's not gonna solve
the case. Not that fast.

59
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,024
Why not? Because he needs a team.

60
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,084
And this will prove to him...

61
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,527
Wanna change his mind about something?

62
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,192
You need a more convincing
argument than "you promised. "

63
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,733
Fever?

64
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,637
Non-responsive to
antibiotics, antipyretics.

65
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,642
Fluctuating consciousness.

66
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,972
Go!

67
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,944
You talking to me?

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,780
Yes.

69
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,158
Imagine that the roof
of the storage closet

70
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,889
collapses on your favorite floor buffer,

71
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,157
which then starts overheating.

72
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,822
Why would I have a
favorite floor buffer?

73
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,491
Okay.

74
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,003
Maybe the electrical works
got banged up in there

75
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,663
from stuff falling on it?

76
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,264
Hmm. Interesting.

77
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,937
Brain damage, leading to
hypothalamic dysregulation.

78
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,509
Nah.

79
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,106
If you're brought in covered in
rubble, it's all about the MRIs.

80
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,778
We'd have seen that. Come
on! Gotta earn that fiver.

81
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,481
Or stuff leaked in the
holes, messing it up.

82
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,820
Lacerations lead to multiple
portals for infection.

83
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,087
Bacterial would have
responded to the antibiotics.

84
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,959
It's too high for viral.

85
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,157
Parasites or fungus is possible.

86
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,858
Or maybe lupus?

87
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,938
My grandma has lupus.

88
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,800
Okay. Auto immune, I'll run a
lupus panel. Infection fits best.

89
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,675
A complete history would be helpful,

90
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,907
which leads to the
worst part of the job,

91
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,483
dealing with the floor buffer's family.

92
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,886
We talked every couple of weeks.

93
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,582
But Ben would know better than I.

94
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,684
No farms, no travel anywhere weird.

95
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,319
You get that, Dr. Buffer?

96
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,130
No travel, no farm.

97
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,827
The file says she was sick
before the building collapsed.

98
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,494
Yeah, I figured it was just a cold.

99
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,833
Why, do you think it's related?

100
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,272
Her being sick and her
being sick? Often is.

101
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,106
She was unconscious when I found her.

102
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,274
We'd been fighting.

103
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,508
I just want to...

104
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,346
Just tell me she's gonna be okay.

105
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,409
I'm not even sure if
you're gonna be okay.

106
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,759
We're gonna make her all better.

107
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,419
Show off.

108
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,796
You ought to be nicer to people.

109
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,801
Where are we going?

110
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,598
You know how the laughter of
little children is infectious?

111
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,900
Well, parasites and
fungi are even more so.

112
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,408
We're gonna find out which one
is making her brain bubble over.

113
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,534
Where, the building?

114
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,102
EPA's doing that job for
us, they say it's clean.

115
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,410
Which means we're making a
pilgrimage to Castle Blackberry.

116
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,781
Her name's Bradberry. I
should've asked them for keys.

117
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,287
No need, I'm sure we can
find a large rock somewhere.

118
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,624
I'm not breaking into somebody's house.

119
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,124
I got principles.

120
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,294
I got some loose change
here says you don't.

121
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,230
I'm not doing this

122
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,332
for less than $50.

123
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,576
Where's the restaurant?

124
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,942
What restaurant?

125
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,311
The one you said you were
taking me to for lunch?

126
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,679
Oh! Uh...

127
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,445
This one's homier.

128
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,243
Dibs on the cold pizza!

129
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,089
I'm sure it looked easier on YouTube.

130
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,492
Oops!

131
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,541
Yeah. You don't need a team.

132
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,543
You can't even get
arrested without company.

133
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,672
You're right. Only one solution,
never replace them, ever.

134
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,316
Do you need help?

135
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,149
Yeah, yeah. Patronize the poor cripple.

136
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,412
Ow.

137
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,185
Let me get that. I got it.

138
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,885
Will you just let me get it?

139
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,990
I'll check the bedroom.

140
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,466
There's some interesting
mold on the windowsill here.

141
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,510
It's gonna take me a while.

142
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,636
I'll cover the bathroom.

143
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,644
She had a secret diary.

144
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,516
Is there any other kind?

145
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,385
What are you doing?

146
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,947
There's a sale on liquid Tide.

147
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,216
If you're broke,

148
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,956
I could lend you a tiny
bit of the money I owe you.

149
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,463
No, no. I wouldn't put
you in that position.

150
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,261
What does the diary say?

151
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,528
Basically a list of
her sexual encounters,

152
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,401
boys, girls, vibrating appliances...

153
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,633
If it was, you'd be
quoting, not summarizing.

154
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,209
It's just a parade of sad banalities.

155
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,303
"I can hardly get out
of bed. Feeling blue. "

156
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,645
Then, three months ago, turns
into a parade of happy banalities.

157
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,776
"It's starting to turn the
corner. Job's looking up. "

158
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,754
We can stop swabbing. Her
clichés are getting healthier.

159
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,554
Or she's less depressed.
Aren't there pills that do that?

160
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,992
Anti-depressants don't cause fever.

161
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,520
Not on their own. But the ER didn't
know she was on MAO inhibitors,

162
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,591
so they gave her Demerol,
that's a nasty combo.

163
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,932
So, all you have to
do is convince this kid

164
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,995
that his girlfriend had a secret doctor,

165
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,974
and a secret stash and a secret life.

166
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,344
It's been a while since a patient
took a swing at you. Can I watch?

167
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,471
I only have to convince the mother.

168
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,319
Actually, I don't have
to convince anyone.

169
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,622
This is total crap. If she was
seeing a psychiatrist, I'd know.

170
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,248
If she was on drugs, I'd know.

171
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,957
Mrs. Bradberry, please sign the
forms so we can start the dialysis.

172
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,294
But why anti-depressants?
I don't understand.

173
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,930
Mrs. Bradberry, please sign the
forms so we can start the dialysis.

174
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,095
Stop saying that.

175
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,867
Dr. Buffer, what is going on?
What aren't you telling us?

176
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,768
He's a janitor?

177
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,869
More significantly, a blabbermouth.

178
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,606
House, shut up.

179
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:55,014
I am very sorry how Dr. House handled
this. It is completely unforgivable.

180
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,019
Except if he's right.
Dialysis will filter her blood.

181
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,355
There's nothing to filter.

182
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,854
Save her life.

183
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,225
She wasn't depressed.

184
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,390
I'm miserable around Ben.

185
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,638
Not me, I like Ben. February 12th.

186
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,541
Either she's depressed or
she just thinks you're a jerk.

187
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,133
Neither suggests that
you should be the one

188
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,611
directing her medical treatment.

189
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,172
Does the diary say my
daughter's taking these drugs?

190
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,239
No, but medically...

191
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,807
Did you find drugs in their home?

192
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,979
She's probably hiding them in her purse.

193
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,218
I thought it'd be rude to go searching
under a thousand tons of rubble.

194
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,586
This was months ago. We were in a fight.

195
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,819
It doesn't mean she's depressed

196
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,191
and it doesn't mean she doesn't love me.

197
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,889
Fine. Maybe the diary proves nothing.

198
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,228
On the other hand, half the
country's on anti-depressants

199
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,927
and it fits her symptoms perfectly.

200
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,741
No ring on your daughter's finger
means you make the decisions.

201
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:57,205
I'm not sure that I know
her well enough anymore.

202
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,946
You really wanna risk her
life on how well he knows her?

203
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,595
Wilson, you idiot.

204
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,536
<i>Listen carefully, and
no one will get hurt.</i>

205
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,267
<i>You must follow the instructions.</i>

206
00:12:56,008 --> 00:13:00,911
Any attempt to contact the FBI
or other law enforcement agencies,

207
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,505
or Cuddy, will be met with the...

208
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,611
And a large Coke, no ice.

209
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,845
Give it back. What happened?

210
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,318
Did someone kidnap your guitar,

211
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:19,193
a $12,0001967 Flying V or something?

212
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,356
Where'd you hide it?

213
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,629
I'm flattered you would consider
me this bold and brilliant.

214
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,670
Yeah. It takes a...

215
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,001
It takes a criminal mastermind

216
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,168
to pull off a heist from an unlocked,
unguarded room down the hall.

217
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,269
What do you want?

218
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,973
Me? Nothing.

219
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,484
But I'm sure the kidnapper
wants whatever a kidnapper wants.

220
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,680
To see you interview five to seven
well-qualified fellowship candidates.

221
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,380
I don't need a team.

222
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,651
You were bouncing ideas off a janitor.

223
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,283
And solved the case!

224
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,862
Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy.

225
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,028
If you can hear what
I'm saying, blink once.

226
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,338
You can't talk right now. You
have a tube down your throat.

227
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,675
And try not to move your head.
You've been in a terrible accident,

228
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,510
but it looks like you will
have no permanent injuries.

229
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,347
You've had a bad fever,
but it's gone now.

230
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,717
I've been here the whole time,
honey. Okay? I'm not leaving.

231
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,083
This is very important.

232
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,182
I need you to blink one
for yes, twice for no.

233
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,060
Were you seeing a psychiatrist?

234
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,497
Were you on MAO inhibitors,
the anti-depressant?

235
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,699
Megan, it's okay. It doesn't
matter, okay? I love you.

236
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,708
Honey? Honey, what's wrong?

237
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,004
Megan, are you all right?

238
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,102
What's happening? Are we upsetting her?

239
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,271
Heart is beating too fast.
Get the family out of here.

240
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,473
Megan?

241
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,573
Megan! Charging to 200.

242
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,548
Meg. Meg! Megan!

243
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,345
Clear!

244
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,130
We shocked her back into sinus
rhythm, but she's still tachycardic.

245
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,260
Fascinating. Equally
fascinating is, why are you here?

246
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,362
I was gonna leave you
alone if you won the bet.

247
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,531
But you lost.

248
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,939
I explained the fever, which
is all we were talking about.

249
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,803
She confirmed the anti-depressants.

250
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,246
Go bet with someone else if you
wanna explain the heart problems.

251
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,874
She confirmed them by winking.

252
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,612
Maybe there was a cute
guy across the room.

253
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,348
She got better when I treated
her. Even I'm not that cute.

254
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,549
Two unrelated symptoms.
Just a coincidence?

255
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,114
Or you're grasping at straws

256
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,217
to avoid admitting you
can't do this on your own.

257
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,592
Fine.

258
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,496
What explains the fever
and persistent tachycardia?

259
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,159
It could be anything. Endocarditis?

260
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,099
No. Fever, no infection.

261
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,638
Um... Keep going, you're doing great.

262
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,568
You win.

263
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,409
I don't believe you. I'm
not gonna play this game.

264
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,312
Just give me the damn résumés.

265
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,018
And my guitar.

266
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,455
I don't have it.

267
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:03,785
Although I did hear some plangent
strumming from under that couch earlier.

268
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,963
Wow.

269
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,370
This kidnapper isn't just
bold. He's diabolical.

270
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,376
I guess he realized he probably
shouldn't give it back to you

271
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,446
until after you've had the interviews.

272
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,622
Huh!

273
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,633
You didn't write anything.

274
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,864
So, what you're saying is, you
didn't find that one big explanation

275
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,462
'cause there isn't one. Clever.

276
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,408
Well, let's just say your anti-depressant
theory does explain the fever.

277
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,071
What about the heart? And don't
say a building fell on her.

278
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,148
Okay.

279
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,517
A structure collapsed... Shut up.

280
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,316
Come on, it fits. Crushed musculature
releases potassium, causes V-tach.

281
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,256
You'd think she'd get crush
syndrome after she was crushed,

282
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,349
not two days later.

283
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:11,760
Microvascular occlusions, takes
that long for the blood to reperfuse.

284
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,994
She'd have a baggy
heart. Echo it to confirm.

285
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,401
Is crush syndrome good or bad?

286
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,501
Does it sound good?

287
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,068
I mean, compared to the
other things it could be.

288
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,511
There are no other things it could be.

289
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,208
Then why are you testing her?

290
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,080
Excellent question.

291
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,886
What? What is it?

292
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,787
The heart's fine.

293
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,725
Why is she sweating?

294
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,719
Her fever's back.

295
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,288
Why would her fever be back?

296
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:48,990
I can't say.

297
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,729
You don't know?

298
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,295
Well, I know. I just can't
say, 'cause you'll hit me.

299
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,241
Let's discuss this
in front of witnesses.

300
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,503
The DT's?

301
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,045
So, she's an alcoholic now?

302
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,877
Her first fever was from the
medication for her depression.

303
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:04,973
Or you're wrong.

304
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,253
The second fever was from the
self-medication for depression.

305
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,378
This is insane.

306
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,146
You don't think I would have
noticed her being constantly drunk?

307
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,953
You were practically living with
Sylvia Plath. You didn't notice that.

308
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,584
Tone it down or I will hit you.

309
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,425
Fine. I'll do liver enzyme tests.

310
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:22,399
Liver enzymes can also be elevated
from musculoskeletal trauma.

311
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,902
They'd be there whether she
had a drinking problem or not.

312
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,235
They don't know that.
Just pretend to confirm.

313
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,296
What's the treatment?

314
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,568
She's not an alcoholic.

315
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,837
Hair of the dog. IV alcohol.

316
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,440
Taper it off after a few days.

317
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,504
She's sick and
traumatized and half dead,

318
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,345
you wanna make her drunk?

319
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,816
Just do it.

320
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,977
You can't do this. We lived
together. We were gonna have kids.

321
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,282
You barely even know her.

322
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,654
Apparently, neither did you.

323
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,342
<i>Hello?</i>

324
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,944
Hi, can I speak to Trevor Kaufman?

325
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,081
<i>Yo, yo. This is Trev. What up?</i>

326
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,322
This is Dr. Gregory House. Can
you come in tomorrow to interview?

327
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,919
<i>House? Are you serious? Awesome!</i>

328
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,522
<i>Hey, I got the House interview!</i>

329
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,534
<i>Oh, look at me, I got
the House interview!</i>

330
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,536
<i>Shut up! Would you shut
up? MAN 2: I'm so cool.</i>

331
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,900
<i>Hey, give me the phone back.</i>

332
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,633
<i>Give the phone back, seriously, man.</i>

333
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,869
I got a page.

334
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:42,971
No, you didn't.

335
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,242
They called a code.

336
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,783
No, they didn't.

337
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,984
You got a page, but not from us.

338
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,030
<i>Did you ever see Raid on Entebbe?</i>

339
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,128
Yeah.

340
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,798
In the end they release the hostages.

341
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,637
<i>How's that working for you?</i>

342
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,199
The Ugandans played fair.

343
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,279
They didn't move the
hostages on the Israelis.

344
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,040
Once again, I'm in awe of the
kidnapper's tactical brilliance.

345
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,187
<i>What is El Fuego Del Amor,
and why do you need 10 of them?</i>

346
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,125
It's a telenovela.

347
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,787
I'm learning Spanish.

348
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,723
<i>Say adiós.</i>

349
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,491
Are you erasing my TiVo?

350
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,692
House, not the season finale!

351
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,826
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

352
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,761
<i>I smoke them out of their hidey-holes.</i>

353
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,865
Do you know what terrorists
do when you don't negotiate?

354
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,341
They terrorize.

355
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,037
Bring it on.

356
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,048
Fever's down. Sweating is
abated. Heart's working fine.

357
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,684
I guess House was right, again.

358
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,350
That's good news, right?

359
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,450
It is good news.

360
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,392
So, what does this
mean, she's an alcoholic?

361
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,760
There's no other explanation?

362
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,567
No, sorry.

363
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,398
It doesn't make any sense.

364
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,201
Dr. Cuddy, she's doing this
thing with her mouth again.

365
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,034
It's been on and off for
the last couple of hours.

366
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,046
Is she trying to talk?

367
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,211
No.

368
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,212
I think she's screaming.

369
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,124
Morning.

370
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,388
Huh!

371
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,020
Where did you come from?

372
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,759
Apes, if you believe the Democrats.

373
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,028
I heard you were there
when I was proven right.

374
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,434
The alcohol treatment took away
the heart and fever problems.

375
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,167
Yes, I was also there
when you were proven wrong.

376
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,175
She'd been silently
screaming for two hours.

377
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,145
Amylase and lipase are through
the roof. She has pancreatitis.

378
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,148
IV alcohol could cause pancreatitis.

379
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,444
Okay.

380
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,888
You're not gonna argue with me?

381
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,155
No.

382
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,218
You think I'm right?

383
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,389
No.

384
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,363
Why not? No.

385
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,192
That's not really a yes or no question.

386
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,364
Which is why I'm not answering it.

387
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,738
If it's not the IV
alcohol, it's gotta be...

388
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,400
Not interested.

389
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,943
If I'm wrong,

390
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,975
she's gonna die.

391
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,905
Are you sure you're
still Dean of Medicine?

392
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:36,044
I'm not interested in arguing because
I'm not interested in enabling you.

393
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:40,080
You need someone to bounce
ideas off of. You need a team.

394
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,557
Don't follow me.

395
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,332
MAO inhibitor caused the fever,

396
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,960
alcohol caused the pancreatitis,

397
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,268
alcohol withdrawal caused the V-tach.

398
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,202
Your logic is irrefutable.

399
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,767
You're wrong.

400
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,778
Well, who are you gonna
believe? A classic toy,

401
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,373
or a woman who, if she had
any confidence in her ideas,

402
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,386
wouldn't feel the need to
distract you with a water bra?

403
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,183
Are you really just gonna
treat the pancreatitis?

404
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,486
Are you here to enable me?

405
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,220
I don't want her to die
because you're stubborn.

406
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,491
Wow. So, you can enable and
rationalize at the same time.

407
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,656
Guess you are still Dean of Medicine.

408
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,597
If you're right, then this guy,

409
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:27,127
who's not an ass, who's not a
workaholic, who's not a sociopath,

410
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,175
has somehow missed both her
depression and severe alcoholism.

411
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,473
Yes. Imagine that, a
couple with secrets!

412
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,672
Why would she lie?

413
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:40,183
Okay, alcoholism, you don't
wanna advertise, but...

414
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,686
If you're right, there'd be
an abnormality on the pancreas.

415
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,488
At least do an MRI to confirm.

416
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,475
Oh, my God!

417
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,717
This guy means business.

418
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:21,156
Or guys, could be multiple guys.

419
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,217
Or gal. Who knows?

420
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,532
All I can say is,
this reeks of boldness.

421
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,363
I am not hiring a team.

422
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,302
You ever tighten a guitar
string really, really slowly?

423
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,173
Past the point it can handle the strain?

424
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,873
It makes this weird sound,

425
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,081
almost like a scream.

426
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,093
I thought this was gonna be fun.

427
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:05,761
I mess with you, you mess with
me, eventually you give in.

428
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,903
But you've shown a startling lack
of humor, which got me thinking.

429
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,067
Oh, God.

430
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,577
What's the real reason
you won't hire a team?

431
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,374
I told you. I don't need a team.

432
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,416
Then hire three people and
let them sit on their asses.

433
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,541
That wouldn't be right.

434
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,178
Three years ago, you hired
a team. What's changed?

435
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,781
I've become a man of
principle. I've gotten smarter.

436
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,586
What answer will make Socrates shut up?

437
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,422
What's changed is, you hired a team.

438
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,225
You connected with a team,
you worked with a team

439
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,095
and you lost a team.

440
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,094
Damn.

441
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,295
There's no abnormalities
in her pancreas.

442
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:43,773
You fall in love. You get married.
50% chance it'll end in misery.

443
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,604
Hiring employees can be even tougher,

444
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,406
because you know, eventually,
they're gonna leave.

445
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,643
There's increased T2 signal
on her hepatic capsule,

446
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,775
if you know what I mean.

447
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,219
You got hurt. Get over it.

448
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,120
Now, if you'll excuse me,

449
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,321
my patient's about to start
bleeding out of her mouth and anus.

450
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,439
Internal bleeding.

451
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,012
Not anymore. Now it's
all over the place.

452
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,411
Why are you here?

453
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,013
That's my patient down there.

454
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,642
You're here because I'm here.

455
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,817
I am done enabling you.

456
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:34,818
I know.

457
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,701
The alcohol didn't cause the
pancreatitis, the internal bleeding did.

458
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,431
The question is, what
caused the internal bleeding?

459
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,597
I hate myself.

460
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,607
You do know that the patient
had a building lying on her.

461
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,664
Four days ago.

462
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,040
Bleeding can start at any time.

463
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,442
She's bleeding from
five different sites.

464
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,343
Do you think they
synchronized their watches?

465
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,177
She got Warfarin after her hip surgery.

466
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,717
It's designed to mess
with bleeding patterns.

467
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,548
Fever, heart and bleeding.

468
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,986
Three problems, three completely
different explanations.

469
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,047
She must be the unluckiest
woman in the world.

470
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,388
I only cling to this crazy theory

471
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,520
because it's been proven
right every step of the way.

472
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:12,722
Each treatment worked.

473
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,458
Yes. She looks perfectly healthy.

474
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,400
This much bleeding is a
symptom of something more.

475
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,562
And you need a team,
because you're wrong

476
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,367
and you're gonna kill this woman.

477
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,039
If I had a team, this
patient would be dead,

478
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,779
because they'd be here instead of me

479
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,855
and they wouldn't notice the
size of this woman's uterus.

480
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,394
Hi. How's it going? Mind if I observe?

481
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,459
Got a big room up top with
a big window just for that.

482
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,968
Stop that.

483
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,566
You wanna look at vaginas,
there are websites for that.

484
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,370
You think I'm made of money?

485
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,306
Can you get him out of here?

486
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:05,975
Enlarged uterus means that
she was recently pregnant.

487
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:10,043
She's a good liar, but I doubt she
can hide a baby from her boyfriend.

488
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,655
Scraping in the uterus indicates
that she had an abortion,

489
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,627
and nothing in her medical history.

490
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,289
Only one reason to hide an abortion.

491
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,129
Boyfriend wants babies, she doesn't.

492
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,292
She's bleeding everywhere.

493
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,394
Unless the guy was performing
an abortion with a shotgun...

494
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,769
<i>Stop enabling him.</i>

495
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,635
It's not the abortion,
it's what she did after.

496
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,506
The boyfriend would
have noticed condoms,

497
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,375
he would notice abstinence.

498
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,373
He would not notice the pill,

499
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,609
which means I don't need a team!

500
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,491
Hey, where's your mother in common law?

501
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,359
Dr. House, this is Doug McMurtry.

502
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,127
His girlfriend was
working with Megan when...

503
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,696
She's dead?

504
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,499
She passed this morning.

505
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,564
Well, then why are you still here?

506
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,676
I need the old lady's
consent to do some treatment.

507
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,645
What'd you find out?

508
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,048
I wish I could tell you, but
since you're not legally related...

509
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,052
What the hell did you find out?

510
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,857
Your girlfriend had an abortion.

511
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,157
See why I didn't tell you?

512
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,227
I'd be insane to also tell
you that she's on the pill.

513
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,165
No, she's not.

514
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,503
If they'd known she was on it,

515
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,738
they wouldn't have given her a
blood thinner after her hip surgery.

516
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,904
The combination caused the bleeding.

517
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,380
It's good news. It's treatable.

518
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,747
Just give her Tamoxifen, which
is normally a breast cancer...

519
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,183
That's not true.

520
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,319
We wanna have kids.

521
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,280
Hmm.

522
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,494
See, I already did the blood tests.

523
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,932
And either she lied to you,
or her blood lied to us.

524
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,908
Tell Megan I'm glad she's gonna be okay.

525
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,112
How're you doing?

526
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,782
I got cancer.

527
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,623
You're on an oncology ward.
Everybody's got cancer.

528
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,094
You want sympathy, you ought to try

529
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,825
the hardly-anything-
wrong-with-me ward.

530
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,959
In fact, why don't I
take you there right now?

531
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,196
How sick are you? Can you walk?

532
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,431
Are you a doctor?

533
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,702
Admitted today. First day
of a five-day chemo course.

534
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,801
Yeah, you can walk. Come on, let's go.

535
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,811
Does Dr. Wilson know you're here?

536
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,107
Well, if he didn't, this
would be really stupid.

537
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,083
'Cause then he wouldn't
know where his patient was.

538
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,781
He might think he'd been kidnapped.

539
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,289
Now the room upstairs is
bigger, it's got cable,

540
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,791
better-looking sponge bath nurses.

541
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,658
If you feel sick, you call
me directly, not Dr. Wilson.

542
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,755
He's getting his last
set of hormone shots.

543
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,478
You put her on Tamoxifen?
An anticancer drug?

544
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,979
It blocks estrogen receptors.

545
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,210
Does it also block breathing,
and kidney function?

546
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,944
She's crashing.

547
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,647
Doesn't mean I was wrong.

548
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,559
This is Dr. Marvin. We're bringing
this patient over now. Thanks.

549
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,562
Anybody here a doctor?

550
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,201
Kidney failure, spiking
fever, breathing difficulties.

551
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,736
Any theories?

552
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,266
Am I in an M. Night Shyamalan movie?

553
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,309
You're House, right?

554
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,348
Okay, I assume you know me

555
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,375
because I once insulted you,
your patient, or your relatives.

556
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,887
If that's so, I apologize.
I was drunk that day.

557
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,480
Patient initially presented
with crush injuries.

558
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,822
I know you because Dr.
Cuddy issued a memo.

559
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,999
Telling you to cooperate fully with me?

560
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,090
No.

561
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,325
Figured that was a long shot.

562
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,504
Anybody here not get that memo?

563
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,444
Fungal infection.

564
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,417
Don't you have a patient?

565
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,580
She shot herself in the
leg while high on meth.

566
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,954
Wouldn't hurt her to be
in pain for a little while.

567
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,527
Fungal infection would
be in her eyes by now.

568
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,583
Haemophilus?

569
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,152
Doesn't explain the remitting fever.

570
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,228
You've heard that I've
got a job opening, right?

571
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,201
I just care about people.

572
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,465
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

573
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,439
ARDS doesn't explain
anything, except the breathing.

574
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,442
If you care about people,
you're not getting the job.

575
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,308
I was lying. Crush syndrome.

576
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,876
Doesn't explain the breathing.

577
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,508
What was the problem with ARDS?

578
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,711
Only explained the breathing.

579
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,775
The crush syndrome?

580
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,082
It didn't explain the breathing.

581
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,587
Are you a fan of symmetry?

582
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,489
Sure. Weird.

583
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,322
'Cause your eyes are lopsided,

584
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,795
and by eyes I mean breasts.

585
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:28,136
ARDS and crush syndrome, both
reactions to severe trauma.

586
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,501
Why can't she have both?

587
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,598
Because...

588
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,936
Because then, there's
nothing we could do.

589
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,815
Boy, you remind me of someone.

590
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,115
Send me your résumé.

591
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,156
I'll put it on top of the pile
that I'm never gonna look at.

592
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,127
I couldn't leave.

593
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,804
You don't seem like the type of
person who would give up on giving up.

594
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,866
I love her.

595
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,469
You loved somebody.

596
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,772
Somebody who didn't drink,
wanted to have babies

597
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,312
and wasn't miserable.

598
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,677
I know she lied, but...

599
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,979
What are you doing? Why are
you saying these things to him?

600
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,415
The woman you love doesn't
exist. This woman is dying.

601
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,124
She has Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome and crush syndrome.

602
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,719
Her body's basically giving up.

603
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,823
We can keep her on supported
dialysis and hope for the best.

604
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,070
Never mind. She has a lump in her arm.

605
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,969
Does that mean you're wrong?

606
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,844
Well, that'd be good news for you guys.

607
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,383
We'll know after a biopsy.

608
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,789
Which patient is that?

609
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,850
Megan... House's patient.

610
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,986
Yeah.

611
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,155
Didn't you get my memo? Sure.

612
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,858
Got both memos.

613
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,593
Both.

614
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,997
And the second memo said
to ignore the first memo.

615
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,404
Yeah, seemed odd.

616
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,435
I did an MRI and...

617
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,034
Of course you did.

618
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,437
What'd you find?

619
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,708
It's kind of freaky.

620
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,682
She's got growths all over the place.

621
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,778
She's got tumors?

622
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,222
Not exactly.

623
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,783
The growths are eosinophilic granulomas.

624
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,194
They are usually from
allergic reactions,

625
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,698
so I'm putting her on steroids.

626
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,234
Allergy to what? She
doesn't have allergies.

627
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,262
We don't know.

628
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,568
Unfortunately, the only
drug she's had enough of

629
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,835
to have this kind of
reaction is cephalosporin.

630
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,307
And why is that unfortunate?

631
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,140
'Cause she was on it two months ago.

632
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,338
That's what you mean, right?

633
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,642
She took it for strep throat
so she can't be allergic to it.

634
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,841
It would seem so.

635
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,180
What is this hospital doing to her?

636
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,449
She has had three
separate medical disasters,

637
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,425
and now she's dying of an
allergy she can't possibly have?

638
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,111
Mr. Lee. I just have to check...

639
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,854
Sam? Are you okay?

640
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,557
What are you doing here?

641
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,033
I was taking a nap.

642
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,899
Where's my patient?

643
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,839
You stole my patient.

644
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,135
You kidnapped my guitar.

645
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,372
Give him back.

646
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,004
Only when you give her back.

647
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,548
It's a she?

648
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,378
It's certainly not a dude.

649
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,248
It's a guitar. You took a human being!

650
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,684
Now who doesn't have a sense of humor?

651
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,422
I'm monitoring the guy remotely.

652
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,654
What, are you listening for
the distant sound of screaming?

653
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,128
The nurses know to call me.

654
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,755
They don't know who he is!

655
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,891
His name's right there on the
chart. Now go away. I'm working.

656
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,869
They give him the wrong meds, who
the hell knows what's gonna happen?

657
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,772
House!

658
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,937
Bad things would happen.

659
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,817
He's in Room 318.

660
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,330
What are you giving Megan?

661
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,562
Megan? Nothing.

662
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,732
Nothing? What's going
on? What's wrong with her?

663
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,672
Her? Nothing.

664
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,403
Then why are you giving her drugs?

665
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,072
Just some amphetamines to wake her up.

666
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:06,480
Everything could be
explained by her lying to you.

667
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,617
The anti-depressants,
the drinking, the pill,

668
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:11,983
until now.

669
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,251
Now she's allergic to something the
chart says she's not allergic to.

670
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:21,094
That's not her lying, that's the
chart lying, which doesn't make sense.

671
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,862
You know Liz Masters?

672
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,133
No. Yeah, she worked with Megan.

673
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,368
That was her boyfriend
you met outside the morgue.

674
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,432
Mmm.

675
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,308
This is her chart.

676
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,941
She's on MAO inhibitors for
depression. She's on the pill.

677
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,317
She had an abortion a month ago,

678
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,185
and she's allergic to cephalosporin.

679
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,884
What's going on here? What,
are you saying this isn't Megan?

680
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,028
Yes.

681
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,969
Ben?

682
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,098
<i>Since when?</i>

683
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,575
Since right before I began
pretending I loved it.

684
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,238
She's the same size as Megan, the
same build, the same hair color.

685
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,146
<i>They were both horribly
injured, unrecognizably.</i>

686
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,310
EMT teams do not second-guess

687
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,877
family members' identifications
at accident scenes.

688
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,758
No. Liz died yesterday. This isn't Liz.

689
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,524
I know Megan.

690
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:32,331
I know her hair, I know
her hands, I know her smell.

691
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,499
What's your name?

692
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,875
Liz.

693
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,710
Oh, God!

694
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,554
Your girlfriend never lied to you.

695
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,568
Oh, God.

696
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,315
I did it all by myself, Mommy.

697
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,784
You talking to me?

698
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,555
Go away.

699
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,662
I did it all by myself, Mommy.

700
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,865
How'd you know it was me?

701
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,339
There's a scent given
off by wounded feral cats.

702
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,309
You were wrong.

703
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,403
I got everything right,
just treated the wrong...

704
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,345
They had a good relationship.

705
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,576
He couldn't even identify her.

706
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,915
And you were wrong about
needing a team. She almost died.

707
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,545
So, I almost need a team.

708
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,183
You were content with your
"people are idiots" theory.

709
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,921
But Cameron would never have accepted

710
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,428
that this guy knew nothing
about the love of his life.

711
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,190
And as soon as you claimed
it was multiple conditions,

712
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,566
Foreman would have done
anything to prove you wrong,

713
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,230
and then Chase would have done
anything to prove you right.

714
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,674
Any one of them would
have solved this days ago.

715
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,036
Hire a team.

716
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,179
I don't care how you do it.

717
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,018
Just do it.

718
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,755
<i>Sometimes I am wrong.</i>

719
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,828
I have a gift for observation.

720
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:19,068
For reading people and situations,
but sometimes I am wrong.

721
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,298
This will be the longest
job interview of your life.

722
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,238
I will test you in ways

723
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:30,474
that you will often consider
unfair, demeaning and illegal.

724
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,373
And you'll often be right.

725
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,679
Look to your left.

726
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,287
Now look to your right.

727
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,481
By the end of six weeks,

728
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,926
one of you will be gone,

729
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,288
as will 28 more of you.

730
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:50,991
Wear a cup.

9999
