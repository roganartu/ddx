nothing but clinic work.

I just said...

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,440
You were lying.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,240
Well, then why'd you ask?

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,480
Because if you told the truth

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,720
I was only gonna give you
one day of clinic duty.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,920
That's dishonest.

participate in this...

You'll do it. You owe me.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,280
I kept you out of jail.
I can put you back.

I told the nurse
I have a runny nose.

But I don't.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I think I have
syphilis or gonorrhea.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,560

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,720
Those of you who stayed
obviously do not have colds.

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,880
You will be
assigned to a doctor
who is not me,

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,880

of wiping crotches.

No, I'm good. Thanks.

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
I have the sedative.
Little late.

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,200
Just in time.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,800
What did you give him?
A paralytic.

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,080
CUDDY: Why would you do that?

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
Somebody had to
stop the screaming.

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
Then he's still in pain.

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
Yeah. But quietly.

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
Paralytic's
stopped him breathing.

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,200
If he goes hypoxic,
he's gonna be quiet forever.

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,120
So either I can continue
to swab people's privates

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,520
or I can figure out
if this guy's delirium, pain

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,400
and insanely high heart rate
are life-threatening

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,400

is the better for

FOREMAN: He's sedated.

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,200
It took five CCs
of haloperidol

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,160
to get him down after
the paralytic wore off.

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,680
So, pain in his right ear,
psychotic behavior
and dizziness. Go.

56
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,080
Nurses said he was
holding his head.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,000
How do you know
it was specifically
his ear?

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,240
Because he was dizzy.

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,920
Means the problem was
affecting his inner ear.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
Nurses said he was
running in circles.

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
Doesn't mean he was dizzy.

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,960
He wasn't running in circles.

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,360
He was running in oblongs.

64
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,320
Looked like
a three-year-old kid
drew them.

a hemorrhage.

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,160
Get an MRI.

68
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,560

69
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,320
If it explains everything...

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,720
Might not explain everything.

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,640
Well, what if he
was psychotic first,

72
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,560
then self-mutilated,
damaged the ear.

73
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,800
Excellent.

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,920

I was gonna say
what Foreman...

77
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,000
Say something else.

78
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,800
He came to the clinic.

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,680
Good.

80
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,360
Decent chance he had
a chronic illness first,

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
especially given
the rapid heart rate.

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,760
Lingering ear infection,
pressure builds up
in his inner ear,

83
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,040
bursts through
the mastoid bone

84
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,240
while he's
waiting in the clinic.

85
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,520
Oh, yes!

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Get a head CT.
Draw blood cultures.

87
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,840
Run a chem panel
and get a complete
blood count.

88
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,800
Oh, while you're at it,
pour some alcohol into his ear

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,720
and take out the cockroach.

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,280
He has
a cockroach in his ear?

91
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,680
He was scratching
that ear

92
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,240
right before the event,
so I took a peek.

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,120
My guess is it
started biting.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Nothing else wrong with him?

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,000
Isn't that enough?
It's pretty gross.

doing the tests?

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
Or they're poor
and desperate,

180
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,760
which is why
this place is here.

181
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,680
If they're that poor,
then they'd rather
have 50 bucks than...

182
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,800
(COUGHS)

183
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,520
Can I have the money?

184
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,360
Look. It's monogrammed!

185
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,400
He doesn't need money.
Ergo, he's not sick.

186
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
And the blood?

187
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,120
Could be anybody's.

188
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,840
Monogram's definitely his.

189
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,640
We need to talk.

190
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,600
Doesn't matter what
you say, do or threaten,
I will find a way out.

191

How can we make this

192

How can we make
the sky green?

193
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,920
How can we make
the tall short?

194
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,440
You cannot make
the uninteresting
interesting.

195
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,080
I'll pay you 10 dollars
for every patient

196
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,960

without touching.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,040
You pay me 10 dollars
for every one
you have to touch.

198
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,160
You're making this
into a game for me.

199
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,680
From which I
can only conclude
this isn't a game for you.

200
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,800
No.

201
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,360
Why? You think if I
deal with enough people
I'll find some humanity?

202
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Yes.

203
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,680
Why do I have to
do this myself?

204
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,600
I got a bum leg. Say, "Ah."

205
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,800
Ah.

206
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,800
Feels rough.

207
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,160
Yes. It's a rash.
I'm gonna need
more than "rough."

208
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,120
Well, it... It's just rough.
Can't you feel it?

209
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Well, I could.

210
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,160
But then what
satisfaction would you get?

211
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,920
Got it!

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,040
Start counting.

213
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,560
How many?

214
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,920
Twenty-six.

Okay. Either you suck at math

die in two seconds.

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040

in here for an STD test

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,680
She was raped.

another doctor to your care.

I didn't mean to
upset Dr. House.

He knows that.
That's not why
we're doing this.

258

being treated by him.

You told Dr. House
it's been less than a week.

anyone other than him.

Whoa, whoa! You're gonna
cut him open? Right here?

358
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,240

What did she say to you?
Nothing.

367
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,960
I gave her
a couple of sedatives,
turned around,

368
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,960
and she grabbed
the whole bottle.
You must have said something.

369
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,120
I said plenty.
She said nothing.

370
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
I was with her
for over an hour.

371
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,360
She didn't say one word.

Why would you tell me that?

380
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,880
'Cause I don't
like hypocrisy.

She knows she wants you.
You were the first person
she spoke to about this.

The fact that I
was in the wrong
place at the wrong time

409
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,520
should be trumped by the fact
that I'm useless at this.

she should be talking to.

talk about the weather,
talk about the weather.

day of their lives.

You might not want to
phrase it quite that way.

422
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,520
You need to get her to
talk about what happened.

FOREMAN: No, he doesn't.
Pretending it
didn't happen...

Wrong.
Pretending this didn't happen

425
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,320
is the best thing
she could possibly do.

00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,560
She's got to make this real.

00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,880
No, no.
You know what we should

428
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,160
be trying to make
real or process?

The few decent
moments in our lives.

430
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,600
Not the crap.

431
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,280
Maybe you're right.
Except there's no way

432
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,920
she can pretend
this didn't happen.

433
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,480
So she has no choice
but to process it.

434
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,440
You've got to tell me
what happened.

435

You don't
really want to hear.

436
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,240

This doesn't have
to destroy your life.

439
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,360
I know.

440
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,160
It doesn't mean
anything about you.

441
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,880
It wasn't your fault.

442
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,320
I know.

443
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,760
You did nothing wrong.

444
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,560
Some jerk hurt you.
That's all.

445
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,880
I know.

446
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,480
You're worried that you can
never trust men again.

447
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,560
No.

448
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,560
Statistically,
there was always
a chance this could happen.

449
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,960
The fact that it did happen
doesn't change anything.

The world doesn't
suck any more today
than it did yesterday.

451
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,080
I know all that.

452
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,640
Well, then what do
you want me to tell you?

453
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,200
Nothing. I just want to talk.

454
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,080
About nothing.
If we talk about nothing,
nothing will change.

455
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,640
It might.

456
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,120
How?

457
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
Time.

458
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,920
Time changes everything.

459
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,040
That's what people say.
It's not true.

460
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,360
Doing things changes things.

461
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,600
Not doing things leaves things
exactly as they were.

462
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,560
Why do you have to suffer?

463
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,520
I gave my word.

464
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,880
Who would make
you promise that?

465
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,280
My father.

466
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,840
He said I would die
alone and miserable.

467
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,160
That's not a promise.

468
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,800
And even if it was,
he's dead.

469
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,080
And even if he's not,
he's not going to care if...

470
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,480
Why did your husband
have to suffer?

471
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,680
How do you know
about my husband?

472
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,440
Well, I just know.

473
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,360
You have to die in pain

474
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
because of a promise
you made to your father?

475
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,080
If I say "yes,"
you'll use that
as proof that I'm insane.

476
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,080
Force treatment on me.

477
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,240
Did the nurse tell you
about my husband?

478
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,640
No.

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840

Yes.

480
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,480
It's under control.

481
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,440
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to freak you out.

482
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,720
Why?

483
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,040
Because I need you
to remember me.

Comparative religion.

Can't we just...

491

That's not rational.

492
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,200

makes sense to you.

crawling across the earth,

498
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,040

less than pure evil.

Why do you care
what you say to her?

508

answer these questions.

It's a simple question.
"Has your life sucked?"

Tell her the truth.
Tell her you were shot.
Tell her...

511
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,720
She doesn't want
to hear the truth.

512
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,040
She's looking for something.

513
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,320
Looking to
extrapolate some...

514
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,840
She's looking to
connect with you.

515
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,480
And that's what's
scaring the hell
out of you.

516
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,120
Tell her the truth.

517
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,800
There is no truth.

518
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,120

She's not asking
for test results.

521
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,320
She's not asking what
two plus two equals.

522
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,400
She's asking for my
personal life experience

523
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,400
so she can extrapolate
to all humanity.

524
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,840
That's not truth.
It's bad science.

525

It's not science at all.
Tell her the truth.

has been good.

00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,560
Tell her anyway.
She wants hope.

529
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,680
She wants to know that
what happened to her
wasn't the norm.

530
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,000
That things can be okay,

531
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,680
which means
maybe they can be
okay for her again.

532
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,720
Tell her your life sucked.

533
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,960
It didn't.

534
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,360
Tell her anyway.

535
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,720
She wants to know
she's not alone.

536
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,480
She wants to know
she's gonna survive this.

537
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,160
That other people
have been through this

538
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,800
and worse and come
out the other end.

539
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,800
She wants to know if
she's going to heal.

540
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,080
Act like you've healed.

541
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,760
Tell her...

542
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,480
Keep her asleep.

543
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
Thanks. You all
have been a huge help.

544
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,400
There's no wrong answer.

545
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,640
Because there's
no right answer.

546
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,560
Wrong.

547
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,040
We just don't know
what the right answer is.

548
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,280
Wake up.

549
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,280
It's not as bad as
what happened to you.

550
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,760
I don't think.

551
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,400
I don't know what
happened to you.

552
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,920
But given how lousy
you're responding,

553
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,360
I assume it was worse than
getting abused by
your grandmother.

554
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,560
What did she do to you?

555
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,160
Parents traveled a lot.

556
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,920
They'd leave me with her.

557
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,120
She liked things
the way she liked them.

558
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
And she believed
in discipline.

559
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,440
She was right, I suppose,

560
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,600
because I hardly ever
screwed up
when she was around.

561
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,840
Too scared of getting forced
to sleep in the yard
or take a bath in ice.

562
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,160
Your turn.

563
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,240
Your parents,
they never stopped her?

564
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,400
I never told them.

565
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,080
Why not?

566
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Usual reasons.

567
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,360
I was afraid they
wouldn't believe me.

568
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,320
I was afraid they'd think
I'd done something wrong.

569
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,800
I opened up to you.
You open up to me.

570
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,480
What did you call her?

571
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Oma.

572
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,680
And you kept calling
her that after this?

573
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,880
Dutch for "grandmother."
She was still my grandmother.

574
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,760
And she was still Dutch.

575
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,920
Is any part of
that story true?

576
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,360
All of it.

577
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,360
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma.

578
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,360
Something would
have to change.

579
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,560
You don't know me.

580
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,760
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma!

581
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,960
Look, you're over-reacting...

582
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,080
Do not dismiss me.

583
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm not dismissing you.

584
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,840
I'm saying you're
not acting rationally.

585
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,720
I'm angry because
you are lying to me!

586
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,320
No, you are...
What can I do?

587
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,840
What the hell can I do
that you're not gonna dismiss

588
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,200
as just being
because I was raped?

589
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,160
Nothing.

590
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,880
Your story, is it true?

591
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,640
True for somebody.

592
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,200
But not for you.

593
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,880
These things happen.

594
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,160
It happened to somebody.

595
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,880
What do you care
if it happened to me?

596
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,280
They're not in this room.

597
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,640
No, they're out there!

598
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,080
Doctors, lawyers,
postal workers.

599
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,360
Some of them doing great,
some of them doing lousy.

600
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,040
You gonna base
your whole life

601
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,680
on who you got
stuck in a room with?

602
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,240
I'm gonna base this moment
on who I'm stuck
in a room with.

603
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,120
It's what life is.
It's a series of rooms.

604
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,280
And who we get stuck
in those rooms with

605
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,520
adds up to what
our lives are.

606
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,680
CUDDY: House?

607
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,040
You gotta get me out of this.

608
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,760
There's nothing to diagnose.
There's nothing...

609
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,960
You only tested her for STDs?

610
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,480
I had seven morons
who forgot their raincoats.

611
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,920
It's all they asked for
so I didn't waste
the lab's time. Why?

612
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,720
I wasted their time.
She's pregnant.

613
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,880
Do you understand?

614
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,760
Are you okay?

615
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,920
I mean,
I know you're not okay.

616
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,360
But are you more
or less not okay

617
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,280
than you were
five minutes ago?

618
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,760
About the same.

619
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,160
Good.

620
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,400
The termination
procedure isn't pleasant...

621
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,360
I don't want to terminate.

622
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,360
You want to keep the baby?

623
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,880
Abortion is murder.

624
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,560
True. It's a life.
And you should end it.

625
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,000
Every life is sacred.

626
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,760
Talk to me. Don't
quote me bumper stickers.

627
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,360
It's true.
It's meaningless.

628
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
It means every life
matters to God.

629
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,040
Not to me, not to you.

630
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,920
And judging by the number
of natural disasters,
not to God either.

631
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,080
You're just
being argumentative.

632
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,640
Yeah. I do do that.

633
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,760
What about Hitler?

634
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,440
Was his life sacred to God?

635
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,840
The father of your child?

636
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,160
Is his life sacred to you?

637
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,960
My child isn't Hitler.

638
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,760
Either every life
is sacred or...

639
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,240
Stop it!

640
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,760
I don't want to
chat about philosophy!

641
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,120
You're not
killing your rape baby
because of a philosophy.

642
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,920
It's murder.
I'm against it. You for it?

643
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,760
Not as a general rule.

644
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,160
Just for unborn children?

645
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,320
Yes.

646
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,720
The problem with exceptions
to rules is the line-drawing.

647
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,920
It might make
sense to kill the ass
that did this to you,

648
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,680
but then where do
we draw the line?

649
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,440
Which asses do
we get to kill?

650
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,720
Which asses get to
keep on being asses?

651
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,520
The nice thing about
the abortion debate

652
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,320
is we can
quibble over trimesters

653
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,080
but ultimately there's
a nice clean line, birth.

654
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,480
Morally there's not
a lot of difference.

655
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,280
Practically, huge.

656
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,280
You're enjoying
this conversation.

657
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,840
It's just the type of
conversation I do well.

658
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,680
But the other type?

659
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,240
The personal stuff?

660
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,520
There are no answers.

661
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,680
And if there are no answers,
why talk about it?

662
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,120
You're healthy.
You shouldn't be here.

663
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,760
I don't want to go.

664
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,520
Fine. I won't discharge you.

665
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,520
Wanna go for a walk?

666
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,360
(GROANS)

667
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
It's the last of my journey.

668
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,520
You don't deserve pain.
You're just
an insane old man.

669
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,640
No. No.
I am not going to
watch you suffer.

670
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,200
I need you to remember me.

671
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,760
I'll remember you!

672
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Why?

673
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,120
Because you're a nice man.

674
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,080
You don't know that.
You don't know
anything about me.

675
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,800
Either you were a nice man
or you were an ass.

676
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,520
Either way you did
something to somebody

677
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,240
that they're
going to remember.

678
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,680
I have no family.
I have no friends.

679
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,360
I didn't even
have a real job.

680
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,040
If I die in peace,

681
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,880
then I'm just
another patient.

682
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,440
But if I die suffering...

683
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,680
It'll be horrible. Don't
do that to either of us.

684
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,720
No. I just need to
die knowing that
something is different

685
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,520
because I was here.

(GRUNTING)

689
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,360
Life goes on.

690
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,400
Is that the reason
why we're out here?

691
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,520
Know why I come here?

692
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,560
I sit. I watch. I imagine.

693
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,880
Sounds nice.

694
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,840
I imagine that one of
them will break a leg.

695
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,840
Just one false step,
one crack in the sidewalk...

696
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,360
You don't really.

697
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,560
I'm evil.

698
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,200
Evil people don't
say they're evil.

699
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,480
That sounds like
an easy loophole.

700
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,000
People can do good things,
but their instincts
are not good.

701
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,400
Either God doesn't exist
or he's unimaginably cruel.

702
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,720
I don't believe that.

703
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,120
What do you believe?

704
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,120
Why do you
think this happened?

705
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,960
I don't want to
talk about it.

706
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,480
Me neither. Too bad.

707
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,400
You know, I don't think
there was a reason.

708
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,920
So God does exist,
lets you get raped,

709
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,840
needs you to keep
your rape baby for no reason.

710
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,720
Maybe he was challenging me.

711
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,000
He hurts you to help you.

712
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,600
Well, I guess it's better
than because he hates you.

713
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,440
You're trying to convince me
there's no God.

714
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,960
Why would you even say
something like that?

715
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,440
Because you're
throwing your life away.

716
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,960
I'm doing what I believe!

717
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,160
What you believe
doesn't make sense.

718
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,200
This is not helping me.

719
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,920
Then I can't help you.

720
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,440
If you believe in eternity,
then life is irrelevant.

721
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,520
The same way that
a bug is irrelevant

722
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,400
in comparison
to the universe.

723
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,480
If you don't
believe in eternity,

724
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,400
then what you do here
is irrelevant.

725
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,960
Your actions here
are all that matters.

726
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,400
Then nothing matters.

727
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,600
There's no
ultimate consequences.

728
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,280
I couldn't live like that.

729
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,240
So, you need to think
that the guy

730
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,720
who did this to you is
going to be punished?

731
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,120
I need to know that
it all means something.

732
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,880
I need that comfort.

733
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,960
Yeah.
Are you feeling comfortable?

734
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,320
You feeling good right now?
You feel warm inside?

735
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,160
I was raped.
What's your excuse?

736
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,440
(MONITOR FLATLINING)

737
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,360
(EXHALES)

738
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,680
Do you think the guy who did
this to me feels bad?

739
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Would that help you?
Make you feel better?

740
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,120
Why do you always do that?

741
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,480
Ask why I'm asking questions
instead of just
answering the question?

742
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,480
The answer
doesn't interest me.

743
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,680
I don't care
what he's feeling.

744
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,280
I'm interested in
what you're feeling.

745
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,000
You are?

746
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,560
I'm trapped in
the room with you, right?

747
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,560
Why did you choose me?

748
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,800
There's something about you.

749
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,960
It's like you're hurt, too.

750
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,960
It was true.

751
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,360
What was?

752
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,480
It wasn't my grandmother.
But it was true.

753
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,920
Who was it?

754
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,080
It was my dad.

755
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,040
I'd like to tell you
what happened to me now.

756
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,320
I'd like to hear it.

757
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
It was my friend's
birthday party...

758
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,640
<i>(GREY ROOM PLAYING)</i>

759
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,840
She terminated.
She's been discharged.

760
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,360
She's going to be okay.

761
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Yeah. It's that simple.

762
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,960
She's talking
about what happened.

763
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,320
That's huge. You did good.

764
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,560
And everyone'll tell you
that's what we
gotta make her do.

765
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,680
We got to help her, right?
Except we can't.

766
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,760
We drag out her story,
tell each other that
it'll help her heal

767
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,760
and feel real good
about ourselves.

768
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,360
Maybe all we've done
is make a girl cry.

769
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,840
Then why did you...

770
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,160
(BALL THUDDING)

771
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,960
Because I don't know.

772
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,960
You gonna follow up with her?

773
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,760
One day, one room.
