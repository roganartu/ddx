Bob, what's wrong?

What happened? Talk to me.

did I wake you up?

Excuse me for actually
caring what I look like.

28
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:04,822
I think the word you're
looking for is obsessing.

29
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,669
Been at it for almost an hour.

30
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,870
If you wanted in,
all you had to do is say so.

31
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,200
I don't want in.
I want sleep.

you got up anyway.

You. Staying here.

00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,401
What, you think
we should try counseling first?

39
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:35,010
Why do you want to
sleep on a couch anyway?
You got money.

the divorce is finalized.

Bob:
It was three days ago.

44
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,768
My throat got really dry
and then my tongue felt like
it was blowing up like a balloon.

45
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,901
I assume somebody checked
for food allergies?

46
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,516
Well, the first two doctors, both did.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,080
Next one said it was a panic attack.
The one after that
wanted to take his tonsils out.

48
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:13,896
The last one had no idea.
He just referred us to Dr. House.

49
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:17,808
It says the attack was
preceded by some sort of
strenuous physical activity.

50
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:19,510
Um...yeah.

51
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:20,919

52
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:28,351
Awesome.

53
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:31,374
A sex fiend
with a swollen tongue.

54
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:34,333
Just think of all the places
I can make Foreman search.

55
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:37,503
He's not a sex fiend.
He's a happily married man.

56
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:39,176
No such thing.

57
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,110
What're you doing?

58
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:50,634
Testing a new caffeine delivery system.

59
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:52,344
He didn't get his beauty sleep.

has unusually loud toenails.

which could cause choking.

and they were remarkably open.

64
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:10,334

they admitted participating in
a threesome a few months ago.

Hundred bucks says
they're as miserable
as the next couple.

67
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,004
Girl.
His wife's college roommate.

68
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,317
If he's not happily married,
I don't know who could be.

69
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:23,830
They're looking for something.

70
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:25,713
If you're happy,
you got nothing to look for.

71
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,100
His wife arranged it
for an anniversary present.

72
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,770
And if you ask me,
if two people really
trust each other,

73
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:33,820
a threesome
once every seven years
might actually help a marriage.

74
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:39,658
Okay, I say we stop the DDX
and discuss that comment.

75
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,636
I'll take the bet.

76
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:47,471
Maybe the first doctor was right.
A food allergy explains the anaphylaxis.

77
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,267
Could be neurological.
Progressive Bulbar Paralysis
would explain the symptoms.

78
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,479
No. ALS would affect
his facial muscles
before his throat.

79
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,481
What if the problem's
not in his throat?

80
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,686
That'd be a little odd considering
that's where all his symptoms are.

81
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,407
- Says who?
- The patient.

82
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:05,349
Since most patients can't tell
their ulna from their anus,

83
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:09,893
I'm guessing this guy also
doesn't know the difference
between choking and suffocating.

84
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:12,210
His throat might be fine.
His lungs might be messed up.

85
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:15,581
Get more blood, a chest CT,
and a body plethysmograph.

86
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:19,889
Unless of course, you think
we should be asking the patient
where his anus is first.

87
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,783
It, uh, feels like I have to urinate,
and then when I try to go--

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,839
Pull up your pants.

89
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:32,852
- It's my prostate, isn't it?
- Nope. Not your prostate.

90
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,913
Herpes.

91
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:36,258
Herpes?

92
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:37,295
Herpes.

93
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:38,966
Your turn.

94
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:43,481
If it makes you feel any better,
half the patients who come into this place
have some sort of crotch rot.

95
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:45,653
Uh,  no, it doesn't.

96
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:49,217
Look, this is impossible.
I've been married for 20 years.

97
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:51,373
You had any sex
in those 20 years?

98
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:53,878
- Yes, of course--
- Then that's how you got it.

99
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:57,036
The only person
I've had sex with is my wife.

100
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,449
Bummer.

101
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:03,615
Take this once a day.
Tell your wife to do the same.

102
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,588
It's not gonna cure it, but it'll lessen
the frequency of the outbreaks.

103
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:08,699
But there must be some mistake.

104
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,026
You got any kids?

105
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:10,711
Yeah.

106
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,850
Any of them take guitar lessons?

107
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:14,072
No.

108
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:15,763
Tennis, art, acting?

109
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,228
My daughter does karate. Why?

110
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:21,009
Give this to her sensei.

111
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:24,070
Oh, wait.
Does your wife play tennis?

112
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:24,983
No.

113
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:28,103
That's what I figured.
It never hurts to make sure.

114
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,071
[Rip of paper]
For Miyagi.

115
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:38,922

I need you to pant. Kind of like a dog.

116
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:40,982
[Pants]

117
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:43,076
That's  good. Keep going.

118
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:48,037
Can I ask you
a personal question?

119
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:51,761
Uh, I guess.

120
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:59,571
The, um...the threesome.
And...the role playing.
Is that because things get boring?

121
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,106
No.

122
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:07,247
We just...enjoy our fantasies.

123
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:11,994
- You married?
- No.

124
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,484
You can go back to taking
the deep breaths now.

125
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:22,224
Marriages don't fail
because couples get bored.

126
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:24,594
They fail because...

127
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:29,058
while they're dating, people pretend
to be the person they think
their partner wants and then....

128
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:33,085
Well, there's only so long
you can keep that up.

129
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:37,047
Maybe they are that person
while they're dating,
but then they change.

130
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:41,944
People thinking their partner will change?
That's another reason marriages fail.

131
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:47,502
People don't change.

132
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:50,092
At least not in any way
that really matters.

133
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,620
I think you've had
enough caffeine.

134
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:01,942
You were right.
It's not his throat. It's his lungs.

135
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:04,137
Plethysmograph revealed
decreased lung capacity.

136
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,088
And the CT showed lung scarring.

137
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:10,738
It's definitely
interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
What's not definite is the cause.

138
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:15,112
There's no arthritis, no sarcoidosis.
Uh, he's not on any prescription meds.

139
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:19,110
And he's a wedding photographer
so I doubt he got exposed to
coal dust or asbestos at work.

140
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:20,650
Cause could be idiopathic.

141
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,838
Can't be idiopathic.
Idiopathic means
without a known cause.

142
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:24,732
What I meant was that--

143
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:26,769
What you meant was
you don't know what the cause is.

144
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:29,823
Just say that, and
we can avoid this conversation.

145
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:32,931
No applause?

146
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,289
- What's his current condition?
- Stable.

147
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:38,337
- Then we can wait.
- Wait for what?

148
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,217
For whatever you can't figure out
to cause something else.

149
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,298
You know it's going to.

150
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:47,790
It's possible the IPF could
just continue to--
[Beepers go off]

151
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:54,008
There's something wrong
with his skin.

152
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:56,036
Okay, stop scratching.
I gotta look at it.

153
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,617
I can't!
This is driving me crazy.

154
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,697
Stop scratching so--

155
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:00,328
- Make it stop!
- Okay--

156
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:02,737
Make it stop!

157
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,340
Make it stop.

158
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,416
Now we got something to discuss.

159
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:17,780
What causes both lung scarring
and the itchy splotchy red blotchies?

160
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:21,344
It's obviously not
a reaction to medication.
We haven't given him any yet.

161
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:26,405
Right. But what besides
what it's obviously not can cause
both lung scarring and the splotchies?

162
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:27,401
Where are you going?

163
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:30,983
To complete the second half of
the caffeine delivery system.

164
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:35,108
Either talk louder
or get in here!

165
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,485
Same color coming out as going in.

166
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:45,982
You think that's
a marketing thing?

167
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:48,591
Lupus could cause
lung scarring and a rash.

168
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:50,327
Or it could still be
a food allergy.

169
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:51,848
We've already
ruled out allergies.

170
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:53,529
Did we?

171
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:54,838
Where's Cameron?

172
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:56,592
We're in the men's room.

173
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:59,582
We need an allergy expert in here!

174
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:04,846
This can wait two minutes.

175
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,035
You don't know that.

176
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:09,090
Chase thinks that food allergies
should still be on the table.

177
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,668
No, it wouldn't explain
the lung scarring.

178
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:14,987
Some homeopathic studies have found
a connection between food allergies
and autoimmune reactions,

179
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,410
which could cause lung inflammation.

180
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:21,032
Yeah. And some homeopathic studies
have also found that
ground-up spiders can cure cancer.

181
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,395
Can I go now?

182
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:23,502
No.

183
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:29,028
Lungs, skin. Skin, lungs.

184
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:30,848
Sklungs?

185
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:34,469
Lungs, skin.

186
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:37,558
Throat.

187
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,692
Heavy metal toxicity.

188
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:45,709
It explains the lungs, the itching,

189
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:48,657
the swelling in
his tongue and throat.

190
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,787
I thought you didn't believe
there was anything wrong
with this throat.

191
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:53,479
I never said
I didn't believe it.

192
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:55,677
I just said
I had good reason to doubt it.

193
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:56,765
And now?

194
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,691
And now I have good reason
to doubt those doubts.

195
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,513
Patient's a little old to be
chewing paint off the walls.

196
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:06,274
Nor does he drink well water or eat fish
every day or do anything else that
could've exposed him to heavy metals.

197
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:09,390
He and his wife worked a wedding
in Cabo San Lucas last month.

198
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:12,634
A lot of pottery in Mexico is
contaminated with lead-based paint.

199
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:14,299
Now aren't you glad
you joined us?

200
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,603
Search their house and screen
his blood and hair for lead.

201
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,662
And test for mercury and arsenic
while you're at it.

202
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:22,932
Chase.

203
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,678
Find out what the resort cooks with,
and if they have repainted recently
or did any plumbing repairs.

204
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:29,720
I don't speak Spanish.

205
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,979
Then it'll be challenging.

206
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,322
Good Lord.

207
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,458
What is that smell?

208
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:48,460
Stuffed pepper.

209
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,423
Stuffed with what?

210
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:52,963
Vomit?

211
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,504
Thought you were
going to a hotel.

212
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,119
I found an apartment.

213
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,426
I can move in on Monday.
Is that fast enough for you?

214
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,630
What's today?

215
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,119
Where'd you get all that stuff?

216
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:14,962
Well, not from your kitchen.

217
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,081
Don't you ever eat anything besides
canned soup and peanut butter?

218
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:25,241
Don't you eat anything that
doesn't look like it's been rolled
onto your plate by a dung beetle?

219
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,399
Try it.

220
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:36,950
It's good, isn't it?

221
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:38,436
No.

222
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:40,997
Just better than it looks.

223
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:46,883
How much beans and rice do you think
you'd have to eat from a ceramic pot

224
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:51,109
painted with lead-based paint
to get enough lead into your system
to damage your lungs?

225
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,785
Are we talking a child or an adult?

226
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:53,899
Adult.

227
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,178
Then I'd say a lot.

228
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:58,732
You'd have to beans
every day for months.

229
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:02,785
Now, why do you have a season pass
to the New Yankee workshop?

230
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:05,735
It's a complete moron
working with power tools.

231
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:07,651
How much more
suspenseful can you get?

232
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:10,295
- I'm--I was watching something.
- No...

233
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,103
You were about
to watch something.

234
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:15,223
I'm watching something.
See the difference?

235
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,607
If the water was contaminated,
wouldn't I be sick too?

236
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,314
People can metabolize toxins
at different rates.

237
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:24,121
We'll test it to be sure.

238
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,349
- Have you done any
recent renovations?
- No.

239
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:31,351
Have any problem
with bugs or rodents?

240
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,403
Just the occasional ant.

241
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:36,075
Use bug spray?

242
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,449
No. I hate the smell.

243
00:14:38,551 --> 00:14:42,582
Luckily both of us are pretty anal
about keeping things clean.

244
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:45,199
Yeah, I can tell.

245
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:58,096
You think ants are the problem?

246
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,560
Can you stop stuffing your mouth
with pancakes for one second?

247
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:03,709
These aren't pancakes.
These are macadamia nut pancakes.

248
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:05,798
Wilson made 'em
and they're amazing.

249
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:10,274
- She said she doesn't
use bug spray, but--
- Silver dollar slices of heaven.

250
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:13,788
- Some ants are poisonous. Maybe--
- Forget the 72 virgins.

251
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,829
If I blow myself up
in a crowded restaurant,

252
00:15:15,943 --> 00:15:18,352
I'm gonna be asking
for a plate of these babies.

253
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:21,040
Is the ant big and red
or small and black?

254
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:22,166
Medium and brown.

255
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,941
Halle Berry brown
or Beyoncé brown?

256
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,434
Is there a difference?

257
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:29,487
Is there a difference?

258
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:34,916
Army ants could devour, dissolve,
eat a cow in a matter of hours.

259
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,376
Australian bull ants on the hand

260
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:42,615
are nasty little bastards, but they're
more of a nuisance than a threat.
No surprise there.

261
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,071
Beyoncé.

262
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,813
Well, then that's not it.

263
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:48,268
How much clay did
he eat at the resort?

264
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:51,883
It's a five-star, 400-a-night place.
They don't cook with ceramic pots.

265
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:52,585
Tox screen?

266
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:54,873
No evidence of lead,
mercury, or arsenic.

267
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:55,960
Run 'em again.

268
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:59,140
Call the resort.
Find some disgruntled
employee to talk to.

269
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,261
- Go back to the home--
- It's not heavy metals.

270
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:03,507
- The symptoms say it is.
- The tests say it's not.

271
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,526
Well, who you gonna believe?
The symptoms or the tests?

272
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:07,361
Could also be a food allergy.

273
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:08,585
Cameron says it's not.

274
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,672
If your tests can be wrong,
why can't hers?

275
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:14,237
His diet hasn't changed
since he was a kid.
His favorite foodis Corn Flakes.

276
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:18,644
Which I assume he eats with milk,
one of the most common
adult onset food allergies.

277
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,695
Start treating him for lead poisoning.
It's the most likely heavy metal.

278
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,312
And yeah,
you can test him for allergies
for dairy, wheat, and legume.

279
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:37,809
I  am not having an affair with
my daughter's karate instructor,
and I did not give my husband herpes.

280
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,760
Found out where House is.

281
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,431
If you're convinced it's allergies,
why're you giving him drugs
to treat lead poisoning?

282
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:49,342
We're not convinced
of anything, yet.

283
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,574
I  think I need something else.
This cream isn't working.

284
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:53,413
We're doing everything we can.

285
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:55,930
Ow!

286
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,734
Sorry.

287
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,032
No, no, it's not my back.
It's my feet.

288
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:01,661
I think I stepped in something
when I went to the bathroom.

289
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:04,127
Uh, it's on my socks.
It's burning!

290
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,502
I don't see anything.

291
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:09,740
Bob:
Please take my socks off.

292
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:11,151
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

293
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:15,396
Ow! Stop. Stop, stop!

294
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:16,861
What did you just
scratch him with?

295
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:20,527
If there was an allergic reaction,
it'd be on his back, not on his feet.

296
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,949
Oh, God, it's burning!
Please make it stop.

297
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,680
Gonna need some
gabapentin in here.

298
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,723
Excruciating pain
in the lower extremities.

299
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:33,996
Not a sign of a food allergy.

300
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:35,675
Means there's
a neurological problem.

301
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,718
More significantly,
it's yet another classic sign
of heavy metals.

302
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:45,988
And I just did yet another hair and blood test
for lead and everything else he could possibly
have been exposed to. They're all negative.

303
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:47,194
It's gotta be something else.

304
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:48,866
- Lupus could cause--
- No.

305
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,931
Lupus progresses slower.
There'd be joint pain.

306
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:53,835
So it's not a typical case.

307
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:56,675
- We should get an ANA--
- It's not lupus.

308
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,046
Symptoms don't match.

309
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:01,348
And the tests don't match
heavy metals.

310
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:04,517
[Beepers go off]

311
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:15,225
Maria:
It's happening again.
He's not breathing!

312
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:20,712
Tongue's swelling,
airways closing.
He's not getting any air.

313
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:22,833
- His lungs are clear.
- We're gonna have to intubate.

314
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,318
Try to relax, Bob, this is
gonna help you breathe.

315
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:26,555
Oh, my God!

316
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:28,373
He's gonna aspirate.
Need suction!

317
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:29,151
What's happening?

318
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:30,342
Suction.

319
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:33,393
There's too much vomit.
We're never going
to be able to intubate.

320
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:34,724
We need to trach him.

321
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:36,288
He's  not breathing.

322
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:02,704
Foreman:
His urine has elevated
proteins and red blood cells.

323
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:05,887
It's lupus-induced kidney failure.
If we don't start treatment--

324
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:07,997
Heavy metal toxicity
could cause vomiting.

325
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,952
And so would lupus nephritis,
and it also causes tissue swelling.

326
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:13,065
He's choking on his tongue,
not his feet.

327
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:16,795
The corticosteroids we gave him
to control the inflammation
can cause facial swelling.

328
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:19,073
It's still not his throat,
but you're getting closer.

329
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:21,417
I'm doing an ANA and
a serum compliment.

330
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:25,313
If you're so sure,
why waste time with tests?
Just start treatment.

331
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:29,053
Oh, no, wait, we can't do that
because we already have and
it's not working. Ergo--

332
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:32,233
Corticosteroids aren't
the only treatment
for lupus nephritis.

333
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,829
We could also try
cyclophosphamide or
immunosuppressants.

334
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:42,121
Only if we confirm the diagnosis with
an ANA, serum compliment, anti-DNA,
IV pyelogram, and kidney biopsy.

335
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:44,963
So now you suddenly
believe in tests?

336
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:48,112
- The symptoms--
- The symptoms all point
to heavy metal poisoning.

337
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:49,691
Yeah, we all get it.

338
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:53,113
Unless you've got proof and
can tell me which heavy metal it is,

339
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,410
I'm starting treatment for lupus.

340
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:07,121
Systemic lupus erythematosus
causes the immune system
to become hyperactive.

341
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,749
Attack normal tissue.

342
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:11,411
It could be what caused
the lung inflammation

343
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:15,665
as well as the swelling in his throat
and now what appears to
be damage to his kidneys.

344
00:20:16,305 --> 00:20:18,114
The treatment's
usually steroids.

345
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,905
But he's already on steroids.

346
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:23,361
If the tests confirm we're on the right track,
there are other medications we can try.

347
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:24,570
And if those don't work?

348
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:29,118
Well, lupus is a chronic condition,
but it's generally controllable.

349
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,289
What do you mean, generally?

350
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:35,657
In rare cases, it can cause
cardiovascular or renal failure.

351
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,373
Cardiovascular and...

352
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:42,175
renal. That's, uh, the heart
and the kidneys, right?

353
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:43,295
Yeah.

354
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:58,674
[Hoarsely]
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

355
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,862
Enjoying the salad?

356
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:15,467
There's no lettuce.

357
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:17,182
I'm aware that
there's no lettuce!

358
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:19,195
Do you know when
I obtained this knowledge?

359
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:20,137
Actually, I'm in the middle of--

360
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:21,302
When I made it.

361
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:22,865
For myself.

362
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:25,531
Well, how was I supposed to know?

363
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:30,494
Well...I was hoping--
This might tip you off.

364
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,599
That's kind of selfish.
Don't you think?

365
00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:34,824
I offered to make you some.
You said no.

366
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:37,056
Ah, that was before
I tasted the pancakes.

367
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:39,079
It's a compliment,
you should be flattered.

368
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:41,233
Here.

369
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:45,366
It's Mrs. Lambert's
herpes test results.

370
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:46,618
Mrs. who?

371
00:21:46,977 --> 00:21:51,223
You've told more than one patient
his wife is sleeping with
his daughter's karate teacher?

372
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:54,080
You wanna stir the pot,
you have to clean up the mess.

373
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:55,803
What would you do
if you got herpes?

374
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:57,711
She's coming in at 5:00,
don't make me come looking for you.

375
00:21:57,795 --> 00:22:00,211
Actually, I know what you'd do.
But I mean a normal guy--

376
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:05,956
And don't be calling in sick, or saying
that your team needs you for
some kind of emergency consult.

377
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,457
If he suspected that maybe his wife
had also been playing pickle games,
he could just keep it on the down low.

378
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:13,272
At least wait
till she got infected.

379
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:15,575
You'd give your own wife herpes
just to shift the blame onto--

380
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,527
Oh, he'd give his own mother herpes
if it got him out of clinic duty.

381
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:21,390
Of course, maybe it was the wife.

382
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:23,586
Maybe she was the one who--

383
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:30,792
Where's Mrs. Nympho?

384
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:32,289
She's waiting outside. Why?

385
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:33,348
Go search her.

386
00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:35,124
What, you mean
her medical records?

387
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,452
If I meant that,
good chance I'd have said that.

388
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:42,224
You think she's poisoning him?

389
00:22:42,308 --> 00:22:46,160
His symptoms should be getting
better the longer he's here.
Instead they're getting worse.

390
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:50,090
So either she's poisoning him or--
It's not heavy metals.

391
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:52,661
We've done over ten different
heavy metal tox screens--

392
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:55,217
Because there's no reason
to test for the other 30.

393
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:58,606
They don't get into the air or food.
They only get in you
if someone puts them in you.

394
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,343
And the only way we're going to find out
what she's been sprinkling on
his corn flakes is to search her.

395
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:07,013
I am not going to accuse a woman
of trying to murder her own husband
based simply on some paranoid theory.

396
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:08,561
It's the only explanation.

397
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,339
We've eliminated
every other possibility.

398
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,379
We have not eliminated
every other possibility.

399
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:14,132
Has he responded to
the latest lupus treatment?

400
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:15,422
He's only been on it
for a few hours.

401
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:17,405
He hasn't responded
because it's not lupus.

402
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,151
It's not allergies, ALS,
arthritis, or sarcoidosis.

403
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,920
She's all that's left.

404
00:23:23,948 --> 00:23:25,666
Do it!

405
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,627
Hi.

406
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:34,072
I'm Dr. House.

407
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:36,915
Mind if I take a lookin your purse?

408
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:38,437
Why?

409
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:43,967
Because I'm going to need to search it
and you for whatever you're using
to poison your husband.

410
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:47,343
Why would I want
to hurt my husband?

411
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,766
Then you won't mind
if I search your things.

412
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,589
Go ahead.

413
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:07,665
You satisfied?

414
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,266
Absolutely not.

415
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,583
She agreed to let me
search everywhere else,
but this she says no to.

416
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:15,664
Doesn't that tell you something?

417
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:20,005
Yes, that she doesn't want
some lunatic doctor searching
her vagina with a flashlight.

418
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:20,998
Oh, Cameron could do that.

419
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:21,962
I'm not going to--

420
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:23,965
The woman hasn't left
the hospital since they arrived.

421
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:26,001
Whatever she's using, she's
obviously hiding somewhere.

422
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:27,416
She's not poisoning him.

423
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,505
It's the only explanation.

424
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:31,504
No, it's the only explanation
your twisted mind can come up with

425
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:34,612
because you're angry that
you can't find the answer,
and you're taking it out on her.

426
00:24:34,696 --> 00:24:38,513
And you are protecting
a complete stranger based on
some childishly romantic notion that

427
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:40,881
people are all so happily married
they don't want to kill each other.

428
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:41,983
You calling me childish?

429
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:42,531
Grow up.

430
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:43,449
Shut up.

431
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:46,567
Both of you.
And stay away from his wife.

432
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,587
Sorry. I'm not giving you
permission to assault someone.

433
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:12,463
Let's see. I'm thinking

434
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:16,766
Colonel Mustard
in the music room
with the candlestick.

435
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,216
There's no music room.
It's the conservatory.

436
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:22,015
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

437
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,379
If we don't find out what she's using
and start treatment immediately,
he'll be dead in a week.

438
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:28,567
If you're right.

439
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:31,952
If Foreman's right,
you'd have basically raped
an innocent woman.

440
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:39,939
My wife fired the maid.

441
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:44,159
Apparently she's getting rid of
everything that reminds her of me.

442
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:45,946
You did your maid?

443
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,649
I was nice to our maid,
which...annoyed her.
God knows why.

444
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,002
Maybe she was doing her.

445
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:54,682
No one was doing her.
All right?

446
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:56,448
But, you still
feel responsible.

447
00:25:56,553 --> 00:26:00,361
Even though nothing
or no one was done,
it's still your fault.

448
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,774
I offered to keep paying her salary
until she found another job.

449
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:08,874
But she refused to take any money
without doing any work, so--

450
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,165
If you want someone to
clean your apartment,

451
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:13,316
It's on me.

452
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:15,998
You're supposed to moving out,
not moving more people in.

453
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,569
She's not moving in.
She's gonna clean.

454
00:26:18,634 --> 00:26:20,162
Maybe I should just move out,
and the the two of you could--

455
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,935
Oh, God!
[Machine beeps]

456
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,714
- Oh, God, no.
- Call a code!

457
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:26,692
Please.

458
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,113
Charge it to 360.
Give him epi.

459
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:33,792
Clear!

460
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:36,699
Still no pulse.

461
00:26:36,783 --> 00:26:38,673
Charging. Clear!

462
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,091
I got a pulse.

463
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:44,566
Pupils are reactive.

464
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:45,757
You still with us?

465
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:48,599
He was without oxygen
for less than a minute.
It can't be hypoxia.

466
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,008
Could be a stroke.

467
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,130
Honey, can you hear me?

468
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:53,075
Back up.

469
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,261
Bob, talk to me. Bob?

470
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:57,193
Honey, please.

471
00:26:58,544 --> 00:27:00,687
Bob, can you hear me?

472
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,476
He's awake.

473
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:06,501
Can you hear me?

474
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:08,964
Honey?

475
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:14,386
[Whispers] Hi.

476
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:20,603
Yes. She is...
quite the little actress.

477
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:29,996
So, let's say she's
not poisoning him.

478
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,885
There's nothing more to discuss.

479
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:35,898
We've got lungand kidney failure,
neurological symptoms,
and now cardiac arrest.

480
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:39,367
A systemic disease with
multi-organ involvement
is the definition of lupus.

481
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,942
Autoimmune suppressants
aren't helping.

482
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,064
We should start him
on cyclophosphamide.
See if it makes a difference.

483
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:47,399
Yeah. And interferon.

484
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,299
Interferon isn't an approved
treatment for lupus.

485
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:51,174
You're not still thinking--

486
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:54,589
Interferon isn't
an approved treatment for
heavy metal toxicity either.

487
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,949
True. But it's pretty much
the only thing we can do
for a viral infection.

488
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:01,980
We didn't consider it because--

489
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:03,947
Because it doesn't make sense.
There's no fever.

490
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:06,074
Because he's got
no immune system.

491
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:09,128
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribe for lupus treatment.

492
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,593
He didn't present
with a fever either.

493
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:13,977
Because at that point, he was
a post-viral autoimmune reaction.

494
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:14,808
Which again--

495
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,772
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribed for lupus treatment,

496
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:21,177
his immune system basically
rolled out the red carpet

497
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:25,139
for the dormant virus, waking it up,
turning it into a present viral infection.

498
00:28:25,223 --> 00:28:26,680
Give him interferon.

499
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,149
But if it is lupus,
interferon could make it worse.

500
00:28:30,295 --> 00:28:31,678
Suppress his bone marrow
even further.

501
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:32,422
Which is more likely?

502
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:36,012
A rapidly progressing, acute-onset lupus
in a patient who's already on steroids,

503
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:38,855
or a team of doctors
missing a post-viral reaction?

504
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:40,382
We didn't miss anything.

505
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:45,905
Well then, I'm wrong
and you shouldn't--
Give him interferon!

506
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,932
Intravenous interferon has
been shown to be effective
against some viral infections.

507
00:28:52,016 --> 00:28:56,241
But, I thought you said
it wasn't an infection.
You said it was lupus.

508
00:28:56,325 --> 00:29:00,329
The increasingly rapid
progression of the symptoms
has caused us to reconsider.

509
00:29:00,687 --> 00:29:02,492
And what if you're wrong here too?

510
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:04,145
What if it's not a virus?

511
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,325
There are risks
with interferon.

512
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:09,560
Especially in a patient who's
already immunosuppressed.

513
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:14,623
Look, at this point, you're lungs,
kidneys,and heart are all failing.

514
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:17,430
We really don't have any choice.

515
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:54,031
[Hoarsely] I cheated.

516
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:55,991
What?

517
00:29:56,942 --> 00:30:00,499
9th grade...
earth science.

518
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,571
Mr. Foley.

519
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:07,559
I sat behind you
so I could cheat off of you.

520
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,421
And I let you cheat...
so you'd sit behind me.

521
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:20,587
I thought we were gonna
grow old together.

522
00:30:22,518 --> 00:30:24,018
In 9th grade?

523
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,939
No. 10th.

524
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:30,551
What, you had to make sure
I put out first?

525
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:33,660
No.

526
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:36,902
I knew you put out
in the 7th grade.

527
00:30:43,327 --> 00:30:45,237
I love you.

528
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:50,948
Yeah, I know.

529
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,232
Say you love me.

530
00:30:55,677 --> 00:30:57,102
No. [Crying]

531
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:58,926
Why not?

532
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:04,325
Because...you're not dying.

533
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:07,636
Say it anyway.

534
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,818
You gonna make me hurt you?

535
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:21,925
I love you.

536
00:31:33,256 --> 00:31:34,369
Foreman:
It's not working.

537
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:37,278
Both his lungs and kidneys
are continuing to deteriorate.

538
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,417
- Up the dose.
- We already have.

539
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:41,489
Apparently not enough.

540
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:42,744
I don't think it's a virus.

541
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:45,554
We've been running titers
for everything we could think of.
They're all negative.

542
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,003
[House's beeper goes off]

543
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:53,283
Increase the interferon.

544
00:31:53,553 --> 00:31:54,104
House.

545
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:57,049
You got a better idea?
Other than lupus?

546
00:31:58,144 --> 00:31:58,871
No.

547
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,554
Then up the dose.

548
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:03,784
Mr. and Mrs. Lambert's appointment
was over an hour ago.

549
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:08,049
Sorry. I was sick.
And my team needed
an emergency consult.

550
00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:14,899
Your wife has herpes.

551
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,734
What?

552
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:19,144
That-- That's impossible.
I don't have any--

553
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:21,664
You haven't had
an outbreak...yet.

554
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:23,298
Don't worry, you will.

555
00:32:24,382 --> 00:32:26,338
You rutty jackass!

556
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,548
Me? I haven't been
with anyone in 20 years!

557
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:31,101
But you're the one
with the blisters on his--

558
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:33,110
Doesn't mean
that he got it first.

559
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,269
You don't need to have
an outbreak to spread the virus.

560
00:32:35,418 --> 00:32:38,763
Yeah! And you're the one always
talking about wanting more sex.

561
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:39,771
From you.

562
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:42,972
And maybe I'd get more
if you weren't actually
getting it somewhere else.

563
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:45,092
Well, you two obviously
have a lot to talk about.

564
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:46,869
Don't even think about
dumping this on my lap.

565
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:49,815
There's gotta be someway
to prove that it's him.

566
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:51,931
I'm sorry. There is no test.

567
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:54,819
Either you two ever
sit on a public toilet?

568
00:32:55,969 --> 00:32:57,281
Well?

569
00:32:57,365 --> 00:32:58,560
Of course.

570
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,779
Herpes can live
for short periods of time
outside the body.

571
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:03,359
Dr. House, you know
you can't get herpes--

572
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:07,711
Some politically correct doctors
will tell you that it's impossible
to get infected by a toilet seat,

573
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:12,186
but they'll also tell you not to use
the same bath towel to dry your crotch
and your face during an outbreak.

574
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,153
See the contradiction?

575
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:15,254
I always use a paper cover.

576
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:17,446
- Always?
- Yes, of course.

577
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,534
What about you?

578
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,079
No.

579
00:33:20,913 --> 00:33:22,254
I never knew.

580
00:33:23,027 --> 00:33:25,258
Oh, please.
This is ridiculous.

581
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:28,353
Damn.
I was sure it was Miyagi.

582
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:29,189
What?

583
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:32,635
He could believe that you can
get herpes from a toilet seat, or

584
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,638
he could be cheating on you
and just be happy to have an out.

585
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,639
The toilet seat
makes sense, doesn't it?

586
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:42,019
Sure, but she'd only refused
to believe such a well presented lie
if she were innocent.

587
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,897
And since you both
can't be innocent...
You rutty jackass.

588
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:47,148
Oh, you--

589
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,784
- Thanks a lot.
- My pleasure.

590
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:53,609
Honey. Wait! Please.

591
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:54,898
Wow.

592
00:33:57,575 --> 00:33:59,262
Not bad.

593
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,809
She has a family history
of arthritis, doesn't she?

594
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:13,349
Yeah, she does.
What does--?

595
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:14,706
Stop the interferon.

596
00:34:14,892 --> 00:34:17,603
Do another heavy metal screen.
Only this time, test for gold.

597
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:19,489
You don't still think that she--

598
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:21,111
And don't let her
go to the bathroom.

599
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:23,729
Why would you care if she--
[House hangs up]

600
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:25,032
Hello?

601
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,510
Ho!

602
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:06,770
Hi.

603
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,532
I'm Lady.

604
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,180
What'd you do to my closet?

605
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:13,256
I cleaned it.

606
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,245
Uh, Dr. Wilson said
that I could go ahead--

607
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,641
It's not Dr. Wilson's closet!

608
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:21,315
Where's the wood box?

609
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:23,796
- A wood box?
- Yes, the wood box.

610
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,687
It's made of wood,
and it's box-shaped.

611
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:28,138
It's been in the back of thiscloset since the day I moved in.

612
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:30,127
I didn't seeany kind of wood--

613
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,184
You may not have seen it,
but you've obviously moved it.
The question is where?

614
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:35,280
Well, I did not move anything, I just--

615
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:39,107
Look, it was in this closet.
Then you came.
Now it's not in this closet.

616
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:41,852
Okay, uh--What type of box?

617
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:43,322
Wood! Wood!

618
00:35:43,468 --> 00:35:46,786
It's a brown wood box.
It's got a metal handle on the top.
It looks like a--

619
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:48,459
like a tackle or a toolbox.

620
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:50,720
Ah, you mean the chest?

621
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:52,760
The one that's under the bed?

622
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,514
Do you need to fix something?

623
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:24,074
Um. Thanks.

624
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:31,154
Well, fine, then I'll go
to one on another floor.

625
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:33,764
Well, actually, they're
not working there either.

626
00:36:35,084 --> 00:36:37,970
Every bathroom
in the whole hospital
is out of order?

627
00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:41,389
Well, they're,
um--The water--

628
00:36:41,473 --> 00:36:43,955
I'm going to the bathroom.

629
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:49,391
Where is she?

630
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:50,866
She had to go to the bathroom.

631
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:52,891
- I told you not to let her.
- What was I supposed to do?

632
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:55,426
- Tie her up?
- Why not? She likes that.

633
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:10,348
What are you doing?

634
00:37:11,515 --> 00:37:13,866
Uh, your hand is wet.

635
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:15,645
Sorry. Must be nervous.

636
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:17,565
I got some bad news.

637
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,317
What?

638
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,624
The damage to your husband's
lungs is permanent.

639
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:27,959
The kidney damage is reversible,
and with the right therapy,

640
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:30,268
he should regain
full neurological function.

641
00:37:30,756 --> 00:37:35,161
Other than the fact that he's not
gonna be running any marathons,
he should be fine.

642
00:37:35,899 --> 00:37:38,266
But that's good news, isn't it?

643
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:39,861
I'm not finished.

644
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,815
When I was a kid,
my dad was stationed
in a Marine base in Egypt.

645
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,103
We were in the middle of nowhere,
and there was absolutely nothing
for a kid to do except...

646
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,752
look for a mummy's tomb.

647
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,416
You didn't want me
to go to the bathroom
because you wanted to tell me

648
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,195
my husband is going to be fine
and that...you used to live in Egypt?

649
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:03,802
I didn't have a problem
with you going to the bathroom.

650
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:06,665
I just didn't want you
to wash your hands.

651
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:12,027
I never actually found a mummy.

652
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,198
But, I did learn a fair amount
about the ancient Egyptians.

653
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:20,407
For example, they discovered
that stannous chloride is not only
great for toughening ruby glass,

654
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:24,375
but if it's mixed with gold,
it turns bright purple.

655
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:36,090
Now either, your fingers actually
are worth their weight in gold,

656
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:41,012
or you've been sprinkling
your husband's cereal
with gold sodium thiomalate.

657
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:45,997
It's an arthritis remedy that
it's rarely used here in the in the U.S.,
but it's still popular in Mexico.

658
00:38:46,632 --> 00:38:48,356
Gotta give you props.

659
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,870
I've never heard of
anyone using gold before.

660
00:38:54,321 --> 00:38:58,722
It's almost...poetic.

661
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:01,816
It's ridiculous.

662
00:39:02,117 --> 00:39:05,366
Heavy metal tox screen
for gold was off the chart.

663
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:09,542
Why would I--

664
00:39:09,626 --> 00:39:11,528
Because you were
trying to kill him.

665
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:15,189
I'd love to know
the why behind that why.

666
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:18,871
But, you're not gonna
tell me, are you?

667
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:22,050
You're wrong. I--

668
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:26,365
I love Bob.

669
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:29,856
I never said
you didn't love him.

670
00:39:35,193 --> 00:39:36,883
How does somebody do that?

671
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:42,417
Sit by someone's bedside day and night,
helping them, comforting them,
and at the same time killing them.

672
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:44,333
Maybe he was
having an affair.

673
00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:46,288
Maybe she was
having an affair.

674
00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:50,940
Or maybe she just gets her kicks out of
slowly sucking the life out of a guy,
watching him suffer.

675
00:39:51,003 --> 00:39:52,807
He must've done something to her.

676
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:54,201
Yeah, he had it coming.

677
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:55,519
I didn't say he deserved it.

678
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:58,327
The only thing he did wrong
was marry a sociopath.

679
00:39:58,411 --> 00:40:01,183
Or maybe she just got
tired of being married.

680
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,409
Didn't want to admit to family and friends
that the marriage everyone thought
was perfect wasn't.

681
00:40:07,493 --> 00:40:09,610
Shouldn't of us stay with her?

682
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:10,826
What is she tries to run?

683
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,215
Yeah. Cameron,
go back there.

684
00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:16,438
It'd be weird if we were
all in the ladies' room.

685
00:40:46,216 --> 00:40:49,042
Cameron:
We started chelation therapy
with dimercaprol.

686
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:53,056
Thrilled to hear it.

687
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:56,403
His kidney function
hasn't improved.

688
00:40:56,613 --> 00:40:58,073
It will.

689
00:40:58,429 --> 00:41:00,797
He's gonna need
a lung transplant.

690
00:41:02,313 --> 00:41:05,681
He's becoming more attractive
by the minute, isn't he?

691
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:09,117
You're pleased.

692
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:13,108
You think you've proved
every marriage is a mistake.

693
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:15,439
Do I look pleased?

694
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,517
Ignorance is bliss.

00:41:46,598 --> 00:41:51,250
