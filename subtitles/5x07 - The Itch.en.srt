1
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,090
He's got a good pulse.

2
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,210
Maintain head
stabilizationand flip him over.

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,090
My count, guys. Ready. Go.

4
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,610
Sir, we're paramedics.

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,360
The mailman saw you having a seizure.

6
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,210
We had to break downyour door.

7
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,140
Do you know what your name is?

8
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,610
On my count. One, two, three. Up.

9
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,980
We're taking youto the hospital.

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,240
No, I can't--
no. No, I can't...

11
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,570
Hey, buddy. Buddy, we're trying to help.

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,760
Sir!

13
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,820
Stay out of my house!

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,370
You just had a seizure.

15
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,280
You could have a stroke.
A bleed in your brain.

16
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,530
Leave me alone!

20
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,460
35-year-old male-- crushing headache
and three seizures in the last two days.

21
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,790
so it's a bleed, clot, tumor,
metabolic, or infection.

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,470
- Stick him in a ct.
- Can'T.

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,780
I'm assuming he has a giant head.

24
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,290
Severe agoraphobe.

25
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,860
The world scares the hell out of him.

26
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,060
So we can only test him with
whatever we can take to him.

27
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,680
Fun.

28
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,730
Agoraphobia a symptom?

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,290
Only of being shot.

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,680
He and his girlfriend were mugged
seven years ago. That's when it started.

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,500
Anybody can hate humanity
after getting shot.

32
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,190
Takes a big man to hate it beforehand.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
How'd you get this case if
he didn't come to the er?

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,010
I talked to him through his
door when he had flu last year.

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,010
I run the community outreach pgram now.

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,340
See? Perfectly reasonable explanation.

37
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,540
She's definitely not here trying to work her way
back on the team and steal your job or anything.

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,980
It's a legitimate question.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,040
He agreed to meet with us.

40
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,400
But even if I can get inside his
house, his brain is a black box.

41
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,730
We can pick this up in a minute.

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,520
what's this?

43
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,120
Take-out menus.

44
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,880
But I'm hoping you'll come up with a better
answer when everyone asks what we're talking about.

45
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,840
- Last night--
- forget it.

46
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,370
I know this is awkward,
but we need to talk.

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,780
There's a reason that we've
evolved a feeling of awkwardness.

48
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,650
It tells us not to talk about things.

49
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,190
I was emotional because of
the adoption falling through.

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,660
And you actually let your
human side show for a moment.

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,460
That is why we kissed.

52
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,090
I just want to say thank you
for not... taking advantage.

53
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,630
You're welcome.

54
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,060
Any time you want to stop
kissing, I'm there for you.

55
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,070
Portable equipment can't distinguish a
bleed or a tumor. Can't see vasculitis.

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,470
What did cuddy want?

57
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,320
I kinda hit that last night,
so now she's all on my jock.

58
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,970
She looks pretty good
for someone on roofies.

59
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,630
The only equipment we have is
a sonogram and a portable x-ray.

60
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,930
What part of olivine, pyroxene,
and amphibole don't you understand?

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,590
pyroxene.

62
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,770
Pyro means "fire"...

63
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,570
they're indicator minerals.

64
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,100
You can't see diamonds so you
look for the indicator minerals.

65
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,560
I assume the diamond is the
tumor or bleed or whatever it is.

66
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,000
we provoke a seizure.

67
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,610
The indicator is the increased electrical
activity focused around the abnormality.

68
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,840
We do an eeg, see the focus, see where the
problem is, whh tells us what the problem is.

69
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,060
The formster and the camster.

70
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,820
Kickin' it old school.

71
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,660
Thank god she's not
trying to steal your job.

72
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,390
Go do it. And search
the home for toxins.

73
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,990
I agreed to talk, not let you in.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,380
You could be very sick.

75
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,060
We need access.

76
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,270
I'm just not ready.

77
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,750
Why does hhave two locked doors?

78
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,640
He must use this room as an airlock.

79
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,420
Deliveries in. Garbage out.
He never has to go outside.

80
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,030
Just tell us when you are.

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,430
We're not going away.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,400
Seriously?

83
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,110
You want her to admit that all he has to do is
ignore us for a few minutes and we'll take off?

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,200
He was shot.

85
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,240
Girlfriend killed.

86
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,140
He probably has post
traumatic stress disorder.

87
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,910
He doesn't believe in a just
universe. He doesn't trust anyone.

88
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Give him some hostY.

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,110
I shouldn't have implied
we'd wait forever.

90
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,190
We've got a whole
hospital full of patients.

91
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,960
We can give you a few minutes.

92
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,140
But eventually, if you don't let
us in, we're gonna have to leave.

93
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,880
just one person comes in.

94
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,670
No. We've got to search
the whole house for toxins.

95
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,960
How about I examine you in one room
and my colleagues will do the search?

96
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,020
I'm gonna tryto provoke a seizure.

97
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,090
I need youto look straight ahead, okay?

98
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,980
You all right?

99
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:42,600
Yeah. Uh, I just, um, I haven't been
in a room with anyone for a while.

100
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,870
- Um, can you just give me a second?
- Sure.

101
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,600
You're the, uh, uh, person I talked
to through the door last year, right?

102
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,740
Yeah.

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,900
You were, uh, you
were nice... and smart.

104
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,000
Kind of made me expect someone older.

105
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,390
I'm not that young.

106
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,370
Must've been scary being shot.

107
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,230
Don't do that. Okay?

108
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,490
You d--you
don't know me.

109
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,460
I've got everything I want here.

110
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,350
I-I-I make a lot of
money writing tech manuals.

111
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
I get stuff delivered. I work out.

112
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,820
I see anything I want over the web.

113
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,910
Um, I'm--I'm
happy here.

114
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,570
Yodon't seemvery happy.

115
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,270
Well, right now I'm not.

116
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,550
Go away.

117
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,860
Did you speak to cuddy last night?

118
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,580
She's fine.

119
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,240
Why would it take anyone more than a
few hours to get over misplacing a baby?

120
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,660
You spoke to her?

121
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,940
Kinda hit that.

122
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,800
So she's all on my jock.

123
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,140
Wha--what?

124
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,770
Everyone else thought I was kidding.

125
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,050
You hit?Like making
out or full-on sex or--

126
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,040
got a chart laid out with all the
bases. I'll take you through it.

127
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,180
Wh--what are
you gonna do?

128
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,670
What can I do?

129
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,860
I'm going to ignore
herfor the rest of my life.

130
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,410
This mosquito bite kept me awake.

131
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,750
Don't careabout the bug bite.

132
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,900
She's your boss.

133
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,800
So now I have two reasonsto ignore her.

134
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,200
It was just a kiss.

135
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,050
There's a reason.

136
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,600
Yes. Those large things in her bra.

137
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,940
You were hiding it from me
means it meant somethingto you.

138
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,720
Yeah, I fiendishly concealed it
within the phrase"I hit that."

139
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,150
Stop scratching. You'll draw blood.

140
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,030
Finally you saidsomething useful.

141
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,380
If I actually break the skin,
it'll let the poison out.

142
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,310
If you... dated
cuddy...there would--

143
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,380
sorry. I get better
reception when you're not here.

144
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,320
What do you got?

145
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,500
his place is totally clean.

146
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,080
No animals. No hidden drugs or
alcohol. No lead in the paint.

147
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,710
and since you're not breathing hard,

148
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,600
I assume you're not holding cameron aloft
in triumph. Which means no seizures.

149
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,070
Speakingof breathing hard,
cameron, you engaged to chase yet?

150
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,330
sorry, we should have clarified.

151
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,630
We're callingabout the patient,
not . Cameron'slove life.

152
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,760
We aren't engaged.

153
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,060
Moves things alongmuch faster
to just give himthe answers.

154
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,950
- Seizures can alsobe induced
through-- - after six years?

155
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,980
A year and a half.

156
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,940
- Through sleep deprivation or-- -
sleep deprivationwould take too long.

157
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,020
You living together?

158
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,350
We spend most nightstogether.

159
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,570
There's a bunch of drugs that
can lower a seizurethreshold.

160
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,260
And cloud the
diagnosis with side effects.

161
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,420
His place or yours?

162
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,120
His usually.

163
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,850
Interesting.

164
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,040
You would've saidinteresting
no matterwhat the answer.

165
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,040
And no matter what the answer,
it would've been interesting.

166
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,440
No engagement. Commitment issues.

167
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,650
His place, control issues.

168
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,240
Not sure whose,but interesting.

169
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,420
Yeah, moves much fasterthis way.

170
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,880
Where was the patientwhen
he had his first seizure?

171
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,310
In his entry hallway getting his mail.

172
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,910
Getting close to the
outdoors spooked him, raised his bp.

173
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,330
Use that fear. Bring him outside.

174
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,750
He punched out a fireman.

175
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,530
We're doctors, not bouncers.

176
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay. So bring the outside to him.

177
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,680
Floor is genuine wood.

178
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,830
Why are they here?

179
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,530
They overheard me announce the half price
bank foreclosure in the er waiting room.

180
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,860
Where's everybody?

181
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,850
Cameron'swith the patient.

182
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,230
Uh, everybody else went home.

183
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,730
Because they don't need to be here.

184
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,030
Neither do you.

185
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,290
And yet you are.

186
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,470
This way.

187
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,970
Molding's original?

188
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,050
Original?

189
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,600
They were here before the house.

190
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,600
The shut-in's also original.

191
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,090
Come on. Don't be shy.

192
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,000
House, get themout of here.

193
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,460
easy for you to say.

194
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,170
You're not gonna be makingsome
serious capital gains.

195
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,530
This is cruel.

196
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,710
And leaving him undiagnosed
is what, altruistic?

197
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,690
Procedure worked. He's
seizing. What do you see?

198
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,770
Normal theta.

199
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,110
Normal delta. This isn't a seizure.

200
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,490
It's something.

201
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,220
Mr. Nozick,are you okay?

202
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,000
Stomach's killing me.

203
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,720
See? It's something.

204
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,330
partial small bowel obstruction.

205
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,180
Blockage expinsthe pain.

206
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,150
What explainsthe blockage plus seizures?

207
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,910
Atrial fibrillation throwing emboli.

208
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,450
Crohn's causing an abscess.

209
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,010
Could bea million things.

210
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,140
There's no way to know unless we get him in
for an mri on his head or exploratory surgeryso

211
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,770
we can biopsy his bowels,
which he won't let us do.

212
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,750
Wouldn't.

213
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,580
Pain changes things.

214
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,760
House.

215
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,260
He told you to stay out of here.

216
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,800
He can chase me out once he's
done doubling up in agony.

217
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:06,270
Whatever yr big problem is, it's caused a
complication we call "colon fos." "Fo," full of.

218
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,920
Since we're in mixed
company,"s" is stool.

219
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,200
Nothing's coming out so the
pain'sgonna get worse and worse.

220
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,350
We need to sticka pooper scooper in you.

221
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,480
We also need to take
a lookat your bowel.

222
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,320
I made my wishes clear.

223
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,830
And if the crazy fairy were
here, she could grant them.

224
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,140
I'm not insane.

225
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,260
I-I feel painwhen I go outside.

226
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,000
So it--it's rationalto
avoid that pain.

227
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,940
Except now you're feeling pain inside.

228
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,660
Not as bad. Nowhere near.

229
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,170
We can give him drugsfor the blockage.

230
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,640
And if it doesn't work?

231
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,710
That blockage will ruptureyour intestines,
spew sewage throughout your body.

232
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,170
Whatever you're scared ofout there,
aren't you more scared of death?

233
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,160
You obviouslycan't stand people.

234
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,760
But for me, it's worse. All right?

235
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,780
I'd rather die in
here than live out there.

236
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,340
If you don't mind floppy
hair and an annoying accent,

237
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,930
I know a surgeonwho will
operate in your home.

238
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,280
Thank you.

239
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,050
With the risk of infection,
chase won't actually--

240
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,030
he's not gonna do surgeryin
some crazy dude's house.

241
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,780
You just
said--

242
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,850
what I said was that chase
would put him under at the house,

243
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,930
we'd take himto the hospital,
open him up,do our thing,

244
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,070
then slip him backinto his room for the post-op
without him ever finding outthat we tricked him.

245
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,650
Some of that was implied.

246
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,930
- It's unethical.
- He'll be asleep.

247
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,110
He gets to makehis own
calls even if he's asleeP.

248
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,870
Why are you sidingwith him?

249
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,180
Oh, yeah, you're that girlwho likes
broken people because her husband died.

250
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,390
And since chase
isn'tall that broken--

251
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,460
hey, why don't we operateon his
infarcted leg while we're at it?

252
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,220
Who cares if he said no.

253
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,240
I was risking my lifeto
avoid becoming a cripple.

254
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,750
He's doing it to
avoidsunlight and fresh air.

255
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,210
We've got to make it look good.

256
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,570
I know I'm a pain in the ass.

257
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,480
I know it would have been
easy just to walk away, but...

258
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,420
you're a good person.

259
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,430
Count down from 10.

260
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,740
10, 9, 8...

261
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,350
let's go!

262
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,020
How you doin'?

263
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,640
- Better.
- Great.

264
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,410
Everything else good?

265
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,790
Uh, everything involving
me kissing house is good.

266
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,630
Oh, god, you dragged itout of me.

267
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,590
You're a genius.

268
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,030
It's no big deal.

269
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,820
I was feeling vulnerable.

270
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,510
He's a friend.

271
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
And I leaned on him.

272
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,900
It's funny. I've leaned
on friendsin the past.

273
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,560
Never leaned so far my
tonguefell into their mouths.

274
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,810
I don't think of housethat
way. I never have.

275
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,790
Why not?

276
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,100
You know exactlyhow it would go.

277
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,150
It'd start off exciting.

278
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,000
We'd get caught up in the novelty and the
hostility and the forbiddenness.

279
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,950
And then we'd realize that the
flirty hostility is just hostility

280
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,150
and his inabilityto open up is no
longer exciting,it's just frustrating.

281
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,740
And--and then it'sthe inevitable
blowup and the recriminations

282
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,670
and we don't talkfor two months.

283
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,610
Yeah.

284
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,220
Well, it certainly proves you've
never thoughtabout house that way.

285
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,940
I get your point.

286
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,170
I will be more carefulwith
my tongue in the future.

287
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,640
That's not my point.

288
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,300
Maybe novelty and hostilityand
forbidden-ness doesn't have to end bad.

289
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,830
Gotta go.

290
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,110
What time you done?

291
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,630
We could trythat new sushi
place next to my house.

292
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,740
Why don't we stayat my house tonight?

293
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,840
We always stayat mine.

294
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,140
That's what I mean. We--we
used to split it. What happened?

295
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,590
I don't know. Closer to work.

296
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
By five minutes.

297
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,300
Anmy house doesn't looklike it was
decorated by a drunk rugby player.

298
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,670
Well, we can discuss
it.I hadn't really--

299
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,100
why does it haveto be a
discussion? Can't you juststay over?

300
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,870
You do know they page me when that
much surgical equipment is signed out.

301
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,290
He didn't consent. He consentedto the
surgery. You think he's gonnasue over where?

302
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,320
He won't even know where. He'll wake up in his
house. He won't know a thing about what happened.

303
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,580
Until he catchesa post-surgical infection in
his dirty apartmentand finds out we tricked him

304
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,340
and winds up owningthe hospital.

305
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,670
Why aren't you arguingwith her?

306
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,200
Because she's right.

307
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,830
I don't care where he gets the
post-op, just that he gets it.

308
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,130
Keep him here.

309
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,910
House. You okay?

310
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,350
Yes. We don't need to talk.

311
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,750
Your hand.

312
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,510
That's weird.

313
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,430
I usually don't get the
stigmata until easter.

314
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,920
Please tell dr. Chase the
patient's ready for him now.

315
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,040
Stewart, wake up. It's dr. Cameron.

316
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,280
If you can hear me, blink.

317
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,760
We were concernedfor your safety
so we brought youto the hospital.

318
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,000
No, it's okay.

319
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,290
Why--why?

320
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,400
- No, it's okay.
- Why...

321
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,720
I just wantedto keep you informed.

322
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,050
I didn't want youto have a bad shock
while you were recoveringfrom surgery.

323
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,100
Gotta get outta of here.

324
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,700
It's okay, stewart. Calm
down. Calm down. Stewart.

325
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,710
Stewart,I'm gonna sedate you.

326
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,540
I'm gonnasedate you.

327
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,090
No!

328
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,210
Calm down.

329
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,190
I need some helpin here!
Damn it! Somebody get in here!

330
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,670
What did you do?

331
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,150
well done.

332
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,180
Your patientcalled his
lawyer, threatened to sue us.

333
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,060
He's now heading home
completely undiagnosed.

334
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,990
He'll sooneon his way back.

335
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,080
He's sick. He'll crash.
He'll lose consciousness.

336
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,250
I'll declare an
emergency,bring him back in.

337
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,920
Not anymore you won'T.

338
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,200
His lawyer now holdshis
health care proxy.

339
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,490
The next time we havean emergency, larry
ruseckas, esquire,will be calling the shots.

340
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,480
I made the right call.

341
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,330
If he'd flipped outafter major
surgery, it would've been worse.

342
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,910
The benefit of being bossis
that I don't have to argue.

343
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,780
You're all off the case.

344
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,770
What's going on betweenyou and cuddy?

345
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,980
Bad lovin' gone bad.

346
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,160
Seriously. Why didn'tyou argue with her?

347
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,200
She just threw usoff the case.

348
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,120
Because ignoring heris a lot easier.

349
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,140
Convince the patientto
let us back in again.

350
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,580
See if you can clearhis
blockage with lactulose.

351
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:48,590
If this thing kills himbefore we can
diagnose, it won't be fun anymore.

352
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,920
Okay.

353
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,630
You gonna keepworking on this?

354
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,390
Yeah. I brought inthe case.

355
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,530
There is no case. He's gone. You've
been tossed. This is totally nuts.

356
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,080
He's incredibly
sick.We don't know--

357
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,830
forget about the patient.
What is going on with you?

358
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,500
This is why we lefthouse'team to avoid
this constant floodof pure craziness.

359
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,930
That's why I left house.

360
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,430
You got fired.

361
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,240
I'm sorry. I know I l you down.

362
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,530
But you know who elseI let down, pretty
much everyonewho's important to me.

363
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,280
My boss, my old boss, my boyfriend.

364
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,350
I did that for you.

365
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm not gonnalet you down again.

366
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,430
It's like the red badge of idiocy.

367
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,790
If the confederacy had mosquitoes, we'd all have
southern accentsand I'd be paying foreman less.

368
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,880
She kicked youoff the case.

369
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,330
This is what happens
when you don't address it.

370
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,210
She acts weird,things get different.

371
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,460
You understand that
differentimplies difference.

372
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,590
She's tossed mea million times before.

373
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,910
No, she always chastises you.

374
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,030
And you'd always come
runningto mto complain.

375
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,910
So you're actingdifferent too.

376
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,710
You're scared.

377
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,780
You are scaredto get involved.

378
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,440
How is that "scared"?

379
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,230
It's rational.

380
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,010
Emotionally mature people who
work together should not de.

381
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,120
Guaranteed breakup.

382
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,330
Guaranteed ugliness.

383
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,450
Any relationshipthat doesn't
end in a breakup ends in death.

384
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,140
Everything falls apartin the end.

385
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,430
That's your worldview.

386
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,920
The corollary,which you keep forgetting, is
that you have to grab any chance for happiness.

387
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,360
Why does this matterso much to you?

388
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,180
Cuddy and I are fine.

389
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,480
The only persongetting
worked up here is you.

390
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,110
I don't want youto be fine.

391
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,980
I want you to be happy.I
think if you dated her---

392
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,730
are you familiar with
the adverb "vicariously"?

393
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,110
If I wanted to
ask her out--

394
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,510
you did ask her out.Last
year. Whatever happened there?

395
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,540
I don't know. I wasn't interested.

396
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,880
Wrong. You were interested.

397
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,080
But amber grabbedyour genitals first.

398
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,970
But now you're single, and
that makes you miserable

399
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,270
because you think it's too
soonfor another relationship.

400
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,290
So you're gonnamake me miserable.

401
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,840
Please, get a girlfriend,or
a life, or something.

402
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,770
For me.

403
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,300
Better or worse?

404
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,540
worse. Drugs aren't working.

405
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,020
I think we should do the surgery
in his house like we planned.

406
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,030
Well, then one of uswasn't paying attention because
I thought that surgerything was just a trick.

407
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,850
We prepared the room.
We hung the drapes.

408
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,320
It's probably ten timesas sterile as any
mobile operating theater you'd find in a battlefield.

409
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,960
We still need trapper john.

410
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,420
Chase doesn't wantanywhere
near this surgery.

411
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,790
Maybe you could talk to him.

412
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,870
I can't understanda word he says.

413
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,710
Taub.

414
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,100
Doing anything later?

415
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,820
Blood in the field.

416
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,540
Not where I'm looking.

417
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,170
How am I supposedto know
where you're looking?

418
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,260
Here's a hint. It's the bloody part.

419
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,300
The whole thing's bloody. It's
a guy with a hole in his body.

420
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,000
It's like you've neverdone
this before. Use the ction.

421
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,920
I will.

422
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,890
And in fact I'venever done this before
because I went to med school,not nurse school.

423
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,690
Hey, wanna see if your
client's actually made of money?

424
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,180
Cutting out last piece of bowel.

425
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,380
Suture.

426
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,420
Mucosa's pink.

427
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,150
Flattened villi.

428
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,840
Intestinal atrophy.

429
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,860
It's whipple's disease.

430
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,590
Explains the seizureand
the stomach pain.

431
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,680
Little bleeder here.

432
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,010
Cautery.

433
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,250
Hey,
wait.The gas--

434
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,280
That always happensduring surgery.

435
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,170
Just the gas build up in the blockage.

436
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,440
Nothing to sue about.

437
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,420
Treat him for the burns.

438
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,230
Put him on antibiotics
for the whipple's.

439
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,740
He'll be fine.

440
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,860
That's niceof you.

441
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,160
He doing good?

442
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,880
Uh, burns are healing
fine. He's stable otherwise.

443
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,910
Good. So, uh, I could stayat
your place tonight if you'd like.

444
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,580
I can'T.

445
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,340
Well, you're not gonna sleep here again.

446
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,600
You might have
noticedthe lack of nurses.

447
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,130
Because you're not on the case.

448
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,000
You can't really use thatas an excuse...

449
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,270
- dr. Cameron!
- Wait here.

450
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,110
Your stomach?

451
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,050
My legs are numb.

452
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,880
I can't feel them at all.

453
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,330
New symptom. Peripheral neuropathy. Got
worse on antibiotics. It's not whipple'S.

454
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,380
- porphyria.
- liver's fine.

455
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,350
Amyloidosis.

456
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,010
We would've seen iton the intestines.

457
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,410
What did we seeon the intestines?

458
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,720
Pink mucosa, flattened villi.

459
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,520
It's not whipple's,
it's gotta be celiac.

460
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,630
Wheat allergy meanshe's
not absorbing nutrients.

461
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,790
Explains the seizures,stomach,
and now the nerves.

462
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,450
we should run a blood test for celiac.

463
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,390
Not fast enough. Not accurate enough.

464
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,370
Force-feed him wheat then do an
endoscopy as it hits his duodenum.

465
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,920
See if there's an allergicreaction.

466
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,570
His guts just exploded.

467
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,940
It might be a tad
painfulto make him eat.

468
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,140
That's house's point.

469
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,720
There's nothing diagnostic about it.

470
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,230
He's trying to put the patient
in pain, force him to come in.

471
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,310
It is a lid test.

472
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,880
So is the blood test,which is painless.

473
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:42,700
foreman, listen to that little voice in
your head that's comingfrom the telephone.

474
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,420
Force-feed him.

475
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,450
Don'T.

476
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,970
You know house. You know I'm right.

477
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,770
We'll do both tests.

478
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,240
I'm not here to play matchmaker.

479
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,810
Okay.

480
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,260
House basically...

481
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,630
well, he accused me of
being interested in you.

482
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,580
Oh, he's just tryingto
change the subject.

483
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,430
I know. But I do have...

484
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,030
I've always... had...
some feelings for you.

485
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,470
Are you sayingyou want to date me?

486
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,130
No. I-I--it wouldn'tbe fair to
house and it's too soonafter amber.

487
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,290
But you thoughtyou should just say it.

488
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,790
Yeah. I thought you should know.

489
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,040
Let's have dinner tomorrow night.

490
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,910
Okay.

491
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,090
Or maybe it would be
betterif we just... had sex.

492
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,070
Pardon me?

493
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,910
In front of house's office.

494
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,530
I mean, I don't want to take any chances.

495
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,140
I assume the point of
thisis to make him jealous

496
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,250
and make him realizethat he
does want a relationship with me?

497
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,460
Yes.

498
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,400
You think it'll work?

499
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,980
You're an idiot.

500
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,850
Trust me.

501
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,780
Everybody will be happier
if house and iaren't dating.

502
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,390
You sure this is the best test?

503
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,060
No. But you've kindof tied our hands.

504
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,020
Soon as this hits your intestines,
I'll look at it through an endoscope.

505
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,850
Stewart, I know you don't
want to talk about this, but...

506
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,060
people who get shotoften get ptsd.

507
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,400
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

508
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,110
It's very treatablewith
drugs and therapy.

509
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,370
It's not ptsd.

510
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,150
My girlfriend was with mewhen
I got shot and she died.

511
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,820
I'm sorry.

512
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:10,460
But that's what I mean.
I lost someone myself.

513
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,570
I know it's traumatic.

514
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,950
No, what--what--what I'm
tryingto say is that...

515
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,870
I was like thisbefore the shooting.

516
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,100
Sie I was a kid.

517
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,540
Everything was hard for me.

518
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,020
I--I didn't go outthat
much. And--and when I did...

519
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,410
I had panic attacks.

520
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,750
Like physical pain.

521
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,420
No, it was, like, worse.
It was like I was dying.

522
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,850
Then I met angela.

523
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:55,220
She was the only reason
that I ever wantedto go out.

524
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,540
But then she died. And...

525
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,920
Blood test will be done soon.

526
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,940
I'm guessing that's a new technique.

527
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,690
Hey, you remember that idea that cameron had about
trying to torture the patient into admitting himself?

528
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,470
Pretty sureit was your idea.

529
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,210
You want me to slow down the test?

530
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,660
Everyone's got all
thesegreat ideas today.

531
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,480
So you're thinking patient won't leave because leaving
causes pain, so we gotta make staying more painful.

532
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,600
That actually makes sense.

533
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,110
You'll increase his pain, but
not enoughto make a difference.

534
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,260
He's on morphine.

535
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,520
He's on morphine now.

536
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,850
Pretty soon he'll beon less-phine.

537
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,550
'Cause when you restock, you'll actually
be givingcameron iv bags of saline.

538
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,140
And why do you thinkI'll be doing this?

539
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,450
Same reason you didthe surgery.

540
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,350
That was becauseit was an emergency.

541
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,510
No.

542
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:03,320
It was because your
marriageis falling apart.

543
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,370
When you confess adultery,
things tend to go bad.

544
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:13,440
When one part of your life does a titanic,
you make a life raft out of whatever's left,

545
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,040
which makes your jobmore significant,
which is why you didthe surgery,

546
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:21,020
why you pulled an all-nighter,
and why you'll do this.

547
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,900
She's having me sleepon the couch.

548
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,450
Just for a few nights.

549
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,850
I'm not doing thisto save my job.

550
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,290
I'm doing this to savehis life.

551
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,730
Right. That's what we'll telleveryone.

552
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:01,200
Have you considered that it's not my place
you really want to be walkinginto right now?

553
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,960
Ric ocasek would kill meif
I-- oh, you mean cuddy.

554
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,610
Yeah, she's a little nuts.

555
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,760
But she's beautiful,smart, funny,
and most important,she can stand you.

556
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,960
Yeah. I came here to
haveyou lecture me on cuddy,

557
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,210
not because there'sa killer mosquito
chasing me aroundmy apartment.

558
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,360
House,there is no mosquito.

559
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,250
This is all about cuddy.

560
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,040
Ah, she's bugging me.

561
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,760
Poetic.

562
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,630
Have you seen this bug?

563
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,730
Have you seen this bite?

564
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,980
No. What I've seen is a suppurating wound that you've
scratched and mutilated into a gangrenous state.

565
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,920
Delusional parasitosis.

566
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,490
I am not imagining things.

567
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,760
House, you'rea drug addict.

568
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,640
You're alwaysimagining things.

569
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,240
You got bitten the night you kissed her.

570
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,360
Your itching always gets
worsewhen you think about her.

571
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,170
You need to address this.

572
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,340
She's my boss.

573
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,140
No, you're not afraid of authority.

574
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,970
You're afraid she
actuallyis right for you.

575
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,160
You're afraidto take a chance
because it's too biga chance.

576
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,280
If it doesn't workwith her, then
maybe there'sno one out there.

577
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,590
I am not rationalizing.

578
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,130
I'm better off alone.

579
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,030
Also, you seen her assrecently?

580
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,030
You're not staying here.

581
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,950
- Oh, come on.
- No. You can go home.

582
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,570
Or you're goingto cuddy's,
gonna ring her doorbell,

583
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,520
and you're gonna ask herout on
a date like regular people do

584
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,570
at 3:00 in the morning?

585
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,890
- When do regular people
sleep? - Buh-bye.

586
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,040
Is he in enough pain to come in yet?

587
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,220
No.

588
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,560
Antibody tests back?

589
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,670
Inconclusive.

590
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,650
Then why are you here?

591
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,090
I missed you.

592
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,150
Endoscopy?

593
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,570
Inconclusive.

594
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,950
Well, then do it again.

595
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,630
I know it sucks, but I need
to test your stomach again.

596
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,000
it's really hurting.

597
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,500
I know. I'm sorry.

598
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,820
Try to get youon your back
and have you open your mouth.

599
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,810
I can't...

600
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,360
He's out. Anything?

601
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,570
No pulse. Start cpr.

602
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,660
Get the paddles. Get the
paddles! Who are you calling?

603
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,800
Pizza. You like anchovies?

604
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,530
I'm calling the lawyer.
Genuine emergency.

605
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,800
- He'll okay admission.
- He's dying.

606
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,570
Exactly.

607
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,910
Sorry to wake you.

608
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,440
Your introvert is having a heart attack.

609
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,870
If we don't restart his heart...

610
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,510
he can survive 15
minutes on oxygen and cpr.

611
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,120
We can get himto the hospital in five.

612
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,910
Lawyer says yes. Continue cpr.

613
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,270
2123 holden green. Patient with P. E. A.

614
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,720
- Clear.
- Wait!

615
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,690
I got a pulse.

616
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,760
Cancel the ambulance.

617
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,980
He's stable enoughto stay here.

618
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,830
his heart's back to sinus
rhythm, but it's bradycardic.

619
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,010
Taub's putting ina temporary pacemaker.

620
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,630
It'll keep his heartbeating for now.

621
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,290
hey, cameron, how would
you likeyour old job back?

622
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,470
I'm asking 'cause it'sthe
only way I can fire you.

623
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,290
Sorry.

624
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,700
In er, we like to actually resuscitate
dying people, not just let them flop around.

625
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,710
Could be lymphoma.

626
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,170
We'd have seen iton the abdomen.

627
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,570
It has to be a poison.

628
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,980
Organophosphates.

629
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,690
we checked the place over and over.

630
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,840
It's completely clean.

631
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,380
There are rose petals in the front entry.

632
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,210
Unless he's eating a
bouquet a day, he couldn't--

633
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,620
- how clean?
- Very.

634
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,740
He probably has a little ocd.

635
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,100
How often do you wash your tub?

636
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,670
Every couple days.

637
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,410
Bleach and ammonia?

638
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,200
Yeah.

639
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,350
You know how kids play
toy soldiers in the bath?

640
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,980
He likes to re-enact the battle of
ypres three times a week with real gas.

641
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,020
Ammonia and bleach makes chlorine gas.

642
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,600
Highly fat soluble.

643
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,210
He lost weight after the stomach pain.

644
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,120
Explains why his
symptoms kept getting worse.

645
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,320
Put him on parenteral
steroids and sodium bicarbonate.

646
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,190
even if you're right, that external
pacemaker's gonna fail eventually.

647
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,730
And I don't have the skillsto
put in a permanent one.

648
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,600
Well, maybe the poison
hasn'tcompletely shot his heart.

649
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:15,230
And you won't haveto feel
guilty for the rest of your life.

650
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,850
How am I gonna place the leads in the exact
spot on the right ventricle without fluoroscopy?

651
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,300
The force?

652
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,320
Taub put in the temporary one.

653
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,320
You can do that playing pin
the tail on the donkey.

654
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,140
Permanent pacemakers need precision.

655
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,220
So we can use the portable x-ray.

656
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,150
It's not real time.

657
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,020
Sonogram.

658
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,270
And what happens when I put him into v-tach
because the sonogram isn't precise enough?

659
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,480
He's dying.

660
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,390
Exactly why I don'twant
to be the one to kill him.

661
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
Thanks.

662
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,330
You knew I'd haveto say no.

663
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,270
But you came anyway.

664
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,770
You just wanted a
reasonto be angry at me.

665
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,850
- If there's something
wrongbetween us, then-- - forget it.

666
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,760
You know whywe spend nights at my house?

667
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,530
Because when we spend themat yours...

668
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,390
I could tellyou didn't want me there.

669
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,070
Why would I keepinviting you
over if I didn'twant you there?

670
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,060
You always kicked me outevery morning.

671
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,760
You never offered me a drawer.

672
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,040
You never cleared outyour closet for me.

673
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,620
I was just a visitor.

674
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,010
How long have you feltlike this?

675
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,840
From the start.

676
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,440
I know it's hard for youbecause
you lost your husband, but...

677
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:47,890
I can't keep chasing youforever.

678
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,590
I just tried your house. Where are you?

679
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,100
Clubbing. Good or bad?

680
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,300
Bad. Vitals are dropping.

681
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,580
The abdominal painkeeps getting worse.

682
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,410
Means we were too
latewith the treatment.

683
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,560
Tell the lawyerhe's off the clock.

684
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,350
We're done.

685
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,980
You're giving up?

686
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,360
Call taub.

687
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,920
Tell him to pick upsome morphine.

688
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,990
There's no needfor the
patient to be in pain.

689
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,450
He's on morphine.

690
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,190
No. He's on saline.

691
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,730
I figured you put himon saline
so I switched him backto morphine.

692
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,040
I love you.

693
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,150
When you reach
puberty,give me--

694
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,580
his abdominal pain.
That was on morphine?

695
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,190
Yes.

696
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,660
Is there something that causes abdominal
pain that doesn't respond to morphine?

697
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,770
I was right.

698
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,850
He is being poisoned.

699
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,610
What's this density on his hip?

700
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,500
Just bone.

701
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,310
Think less boney.

702
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,690
You think he's got lead poisoning?

703
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Explains the constipation,
the nerves, seizes.

704
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,770
Hold him down.

705
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,810
You're not gonna feela thing...

706
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,570
except excruciating pain.

707
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,130
The mugger used hollow points.

708
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,370
They explodedand left fragments.

709
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,520
Your doctors missed a couple
hiding behind your hip bone.

710
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,500
It's no biggie.

711
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:03,780
Except years later, they started to dissolve,
and then, biggie, you started to dissolve.

712
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,940
I'll start him on chelation.

713
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,060
The agoraphobia,could it--

714
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,750
no.Lead wouldn't have started to
disintegrate till years after.

715
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,420
But it could have exacerbated the fear.

716
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,980
I don't need to change.

717
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,510
I know you think that.

718
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,230
But your lifecould be better.

719
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,120
You--you--you'dhave
choices.

720
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,270
He's lying.

721
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,770
About what?

722
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,950
About everything. About his life.

723
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,040
He doesn't even think he's
happy here. He's miserable.

724
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,490
- I've got everythingI need.
- Yeah?

725
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,750
Well, then why did taub find rose
petals in your entry hallway?

726
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,500
Struck me as a little weird.

727
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,330
Thought it might be medically relevant.

728
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,980
But it actually just told
me that you were pathetic.

729
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,810
The day you crashed in your entry way...

730
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,300
was your girlfriend'sbirthday.

731
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,270
You weren't there for the mail.

732
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,460
You were trying to golay
flowers on her grave.

733
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
Yeah, he's got ptsd.

734
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,460
Yeah, he's agoraphobic.

735
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,920
He's also a coward.

736
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,540
You want to change
your life, do something.

737
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,840
Don't believe your own rationalizations.

738
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,320
Don't lock yourself
up,pretend you're happy.

739
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,520
You were right. About my
husband. It affected me.

740
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:38,810
It still affects me.

741
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,080
If you're saying you'll
never be able to--

742
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,780
I cleaned out a drawer for you.

743
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:50,470
Like a big one.

744
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,710
* Im in love with a girl *

745
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:47,410
* Finest girl in the world *

746
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:55,700
* I didnt know I could feel this way *

747
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,770
* Think about her all the time *

748
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,010
* Always on my mind *

749
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:21,660
* I didnt know about love *

750
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:35,900
* All that a man should do is true *

751
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:48,620
* All that a man should do is true *

752
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:59,100
* Im in love with a girl *

753
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:04,960
* Finest girl in the world *

754
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:12,510
* I didnt know this could happen to me *
