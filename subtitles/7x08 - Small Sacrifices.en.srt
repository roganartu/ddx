When the doctors said
she had two months to live,

43
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,897
that's when I made my bargain.

00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,466
With your health insurance

45
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,434

<i>How did that negotiation go?</i>

00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,123
She moved out

57
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,326
Well, at least your daughter
has one viable role model.

58
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,228
You don't believe
in God?

59
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,896
I did.
Then I grew my curly hairs.

60
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,200
So how do you think
I was cured?

61
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,868
Maybe you were misdiagnosed
in the first place.

62
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,304
You have your answer,
doctors.

63
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,405
We have ours.

64
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,539
<i>Causal determinism.</i>

65
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,559

The cave man who heard a rustle

<i>lived longer than the guy</i>
<i>who assumed</i>

69
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,915
<i>it was just a breeze.</i>

70
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,751
The problem is, when we
don't find a logical answer,

71
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,986
we settle
for a stupid one.

72
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,021
Ritual is what happens

73
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,623
when we run out
of rational.

74
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,691
<i>If you're done mocking him,</i>

75
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,992
we need to prep
for an lp.

76
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,594
Good.

77
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,729
Another hole in him
should really make God's day.

78
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,204
Why are you late?

79
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,206
Your next dental appointment
isn't till January,

80
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,258
and you just saw your gp
eight days ago.

81
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,411
You think stage iv glioblastoma
in an eight-year-old

82
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:47,980
could disappear
in three weeks?

83
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,582
I had a flat tire.
Your patient has cancer?

84
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,951
Your tires got less
than 5,000 miles on them.

85
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,853
No, and neither does
my patient's daughter.

86
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:55,888
<i>I hit a piece of rebar</i>

87
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,856
near a construction site.

88
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,474
In three weeks?

89
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,993
It's highly unlikely.

90
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,261
There's no construction site

91
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,295
between here
and your home.

92
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,130
<i>I agree.</i>

93
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,398
I think it was
a misdiagnosed cyst.

94
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,600
But there is one
between here and my dry cleaner.

95
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,102
It could be
a misdiagnosis,

96
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,104
or it could be
spontaneous remission.

97
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,405
But...

98
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,573
Why would I lie
about this?

99
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,141
I don't know yet.

100
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,075
But you would have dropped off
your tie.

101
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,977
It's got a mustard stain.

102
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,752
I was buying
an engagement ring.

103
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,421
I'm gonna propose to Sam
at the wedding.

104
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,457
That is the second stupidest
thing I've heard today.

105
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,326
And I'm surprised
how close you came.

106
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,728
You don't need
to buy her a new ring.

107
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,764
Isn't the first one good
for all you can marry?

108
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,100
I assume you haven't apologized
to Cuddy yet.

109
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,602
Your stupidity demands
equal time.

110
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,203
Nothing to apologize for.

111
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,373
Pretend to apologize.

112
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,641
You want me to lie?

113
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,742
There's a lovely symmetry
to it.

114
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,743
The lie got you into it.

115
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,744
A lie gets you out of it.

116
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,413
Everybody lies.

117
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,315
I'm sure Cuddy...

118
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,686
Just need to give her
a chance.

119
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,691
Yeah, that must have been
what I meant.

120
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,426
Have you seen
the bride-to-be?

121
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,594
Gorgeous woman
half his age.

122
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:10,629
He's a lucky guy.

123
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,464
Yeah, for a while.

124
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,700
My father's 19 years older
than my mother,

125
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,035
and they've been happily married
for 32 years.

126
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,705
I'm guessing your dad wasn't
on the Forbes 400

127
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,373
and your mom didn't look
like a swimsuit model.

128
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,810
Sorry.
That didn't come out right.

129
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,045
My father was the classics chair
at Columbia,

130
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,648
and my mother was his student.

131
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,818
His gorgeous student.

132
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,487
What's it mean
when somebody takes

133
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,521
their cell phone
into the bathroom

134
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,457
when they're taking
a shower?

135
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,625
It means they don't want you
to check their calls,

136
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,094
emails, or texts.

137
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,495
<i>If we're talking</i>
<i>about your wife,</i>

138
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,699
it means the chickens
are coming home to roost.

139
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,002
Taub has been known
to dabble.

140
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,336
Used to be.

141
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,572
<i>Maybe it's just a habit.</i>

142
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,407
I do that with my cell phone,
and I live alone.

143
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,642
She has a meeting today
at 1:30.

144
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,511
At a hotel.

145
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,913
I'm gonna go
with the chicken thing.

146
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,583
<i>Negative for toxocara,</i>
<i>bacteroides,</i>

147
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,718
ascaris,
everything.

148
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,286
So what looks
like an infection

149
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,056
but doesn't test
like one?

150
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,724
Animals.

151
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,126
I'm sure
your wife's just seeing a dude.

152
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,829
Patient works
for Morgan Timber Works.

153
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,131
Card's in the file.

154
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,566
Specializing in stables,
barns, and stalls.

155
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,902
He works around animals.
<i>Rhodococcus equi.</i>

156
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,071
Unless this guy's
sleeping in the manger...

157
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,573
Or has a history
of open wounds.

158
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,582
We think you have
rhodococcus equi,

159
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,151
a horse infection.

160
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,719
<i>It's pretty rare in humans,</i>
<i>but easily treatable</i>

161
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,953
with antibiotics.

162
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,622
Does it make
your teeth fall out?

163
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,892
No.

164
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,500
Then again,
maybe we were wrong.

165
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,567
Fever,
coughing up blood,

166
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,584
coughing up teeth.

167
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:04,653
So either God sweetened the deal

168
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:07,789
with a "no flossing" clause
or...

169
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:09,174
Radiation sickness.

170
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,727
Yeah, maybe the carpenter
builds microwave ovens.

171
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:13,262
Kaposi's sarcoma?

172
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:14,429
No skin lesions.

173
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:15,898
Heavy metal poisoning fits.

174
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:18,467
Canned tuna, Sushi,
lead paint.

175
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:20,202
Heavy metal it is.
Do a home search

176
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,436
and a peripheral smear.

177
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:22,538
I can't.

178
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,106
I have
a personal errand to run.

179
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:27,209
Trying to catch
your wife cheating?

180
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:28,510
Oh...

181
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:30,913
Why would you say that?

182
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,147
Missing mojo.

183
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:33,315
Posture's slumped.

184
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:34,583
Expression defeated.

185
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,318
Didn't try to back up
your theory.

186
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:37,486
And Chase told me.

187
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:41,023
Go.
Find your mojo.

188
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:51,200
Shopkeeper?
I need a patient file.

189
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,768
Ask records.

190
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:53,802
Not one of our patients.

191
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,270
My patient's daughter.

192
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:57,005
Ask your patient.
He thinks I only want it

193
00:09:57,073 --> 00:09:58,106
to debunk his faith.

194
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:00,008
And why would he think that?

195
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:02,544
Because he's strangely
perceptive for an idiot.

196
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:05,948
And I'm going to violate
patient privacy laws

197
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:07,616
just to keep you happy?

198
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:10,552
You keep me happy,
I return the favor.

199
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,887
Think of it
as tat for tit.

200
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,288
When we're at work,

201
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:16,558
we need to focus
on our work thoughts.

202
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:19,094
Why are you wearing that?

203
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,529
It's my dressy casual.

204
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:21,697
What do you think?

205
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:23,131
You look like Wilson.

206
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,300
It looks weird.

207
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:27,836
Well, you knew
I'd think that.

208
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:29,404
Which makes me wonder
why you look disappointed.

209
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,506
If you prick me,
do I not bleed?

210
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:35,844
You knew I wouldn't like it,
but you thought

211
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:37,512
I would say I did.

212
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,981
That's what this is about.

213
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:41,283
You're trying to trap me
into lying to you.

214
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:42,384
You sure?

215
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:43,752
'Cause that sounds
so juvenile.

216
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:52,527
You're okay
with burglary now?

217
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:54,196
I asked his permission.

218
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:57,466
The reason
we don't ask permission

219
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,501
is we're afraid the patient
is going

220
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:00,902
to hide something,
but our patient

221
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,638
hasn't been home,
lives alone.

222
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:03,872
He doesn't have any help,

223
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,907
and he has no motive
to hide anything.

224
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,676
Did you ask
for his key too?

225
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:09,244
Oh, doesn't have one.

226
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:19,087
And now we know why.

227
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:21,857
You think he's crazy?

228
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:23,859
Crucifixion's
pretty convincing evidence.

229
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:24,860
<i>Lead paint?</i>

230
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:27,963
The place is too new.

231
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:30,232
He believes in a higher power
that can affect his life.

232
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,367
Like most people
on the planet.

233
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:33,702
True.
On the other hand,

234
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,670
crucified himself.

235
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:37,139
No canned tuna.

236
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,074
And I don't think we have
to worry about Sushi.

237
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:41,009
<i>No computer.</i>
<i>No television.</i>

238
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,378
No music.
What does he do?

239
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:45,130
He reads.

240
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:46,581
Prayer's been proven
to aid recovery.

241
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,650
Only if the person knows
they're being prayed for.

242
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:51,953
Means there's
no objective effect.

243
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,423
<i>So faith comes from within.</i>

244
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,325
Not exactly a newsflash.

245
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:06,768
I guess worry is good
for the waistline.

246
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,943
<i>It's not worry.</i>

247
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:16,912
It's starvation.

248
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:18,046
His tooth didn't fall out

249
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:19,414
because
of heavy metal poisoning.

250
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:20,682
It fell out
because of malnutrition.

251
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,384
He does have rhodococcus equi.

252
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:25,487
Taub was right.

253
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:27,723
He just didn't know why.

254
00:12:33,363 --> 00:12:34,563
It's locked.

255
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,231
<i>I'm busy!</i>

256
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,666
I'll wait.

257
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:43,438
I really am busy.

258
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:46,041
Cuddy got me
the daughter's file.

259
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,977
Well, not Cuddy exactly.
Her signature.

260
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:52,914
Well, not exactly
her signature.

261
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:54,349
Another lie?

262
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,051
Thought you could take
a look at it for me.

263
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,919
Maybe you hadn't heard.
I'm kind of busy.

264
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,154
With what?

265
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:01,289
Sudoku.
What do you think?

266
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:05,660
I'm the head of oncology
at a major hospital.

267
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:07,295
And yet these files

268
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:10,565
are not from this hospital.

269
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:13,368
These are from
where-my-fiancee-works memorial.

270
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,570
Sam's boss is doing
a clinical review

271
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:17,005
of all of her files,

272
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,340
and she just wanted
to make sure

273
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:20,208
everything was in order
before he starts on Monday.

274
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:23,578
Which explains why Sam
is too busy to look at my file.

275
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:26,748
If I don't help her, she can't
go to the wedding and...

276
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,583
We fell in love
at her cousin's wedding,

277
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:30,685
which is why I want
to propose to her at a wedding.

278
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,821
And now you have 60 seconds

279
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:34,389
to berate me for that
and for helping my girlfriend

280
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:35,824
with her homework.

281
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,292
You don't want to propose
at a wedding.

282
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,828
Emotions running high,
people on edge.

283
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:43,031
You ought to try somewhere
like a buddhist temple

284
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,499
or an aquarium.

285
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:47,702
Or a buddhist aquarium.

286
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,304
That only took ten seconds.

287
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:51,940
You can spend the rest
of the time on my file.

288
00:13:57,547 --> 00:13:59,581
Rachel?

289
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:14,396
Hey.
How long before you're home?

290
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:15,730
<i>Not long.</i>

291
00:14:15,798 --> 00:14:18,767
<i>Uh, hey.</i>

292
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:21,536
Hey.

293
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:24,306
Uh, you left your laptop on.

294
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:27,709
Saw you today.

295
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:29,244
At the hotel.

296
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:31,246
Were you checking up on me?

297
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:33,348
Yes.

298
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,883
Satisfied?

299
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:37,552
Yes.

300
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,688
Good.

301
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,557
That's it?

302
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,792
You said
you're satisfied.

303
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,994
It's enough.

304
00:14:46,062 --> 00:14:48,797
You're not wondering
why it started.

305
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:50,398
That makes me think

306
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:51,433
you don't want
to talk about this,

307
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,767
which makes me think...

308
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:53,902
You're being paranoid.

309
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,203
You took your cell phone

310
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:56,505
with you
into the bathroom

311
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:57,639
when you took your shower
this morning.

312
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,777
I made a new friend.

313
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:04,513
Online.

314
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,414
In a support group.

315
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:09,217
A guy?

316
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,286
Yes.

317
00:15:11,354 --> 00:15:13,388
A support group for what?

318
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:16,858
For people
with unfaithful spouses.

319
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:24,165
Why didn't you tell us
you were starving yourself?

320
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,135
Well, I wasn't trying to.

321
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:32,173
I'm on a tight budget,
and it seemed like an okay diet.

322
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,308
Well, you seem
to be felling better.

323
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:34,876
Not really.

324
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:37,178
My legs are killing me.

325
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:41,716
How bad is the pain?

326
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:45,086
On a scale of one to ten,
ten being the worst.

327
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:48,156
9 1/2.

328
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,692
Then why are you smiling?

329
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,861
I'm not smiling.

330
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,281
<i>Leg pain</i>
<i>and pseudobulbar affect.</i>

331
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,109
He's feeling one emotion

332
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:04,178
while unknowingly expressing
another one.

333
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:06,180
Classic neurohecatia.

334
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,449
Two days
of anticholinergics,

335
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:09,316
you'll be walking
out of here.

336
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:11,118
Really?

337
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,753
No.
I just made that up

338
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:14,021
to see your reaction.

339
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,589
Diagnostic test.

340
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:18,359
This is awesome.

341
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:22,463
33-year-old carpenter
presenting with narcissism,

342
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,165
delusions of grandeur,
hallucinations.

343
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:25,733
He hasn't had hallucinations.

344
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:26,667
I'm not talking about him.

345
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,068
I'm talking about "him"

346
00:16:28,136 --> 00:16:30,437
with a capital "o-m-g."

347
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:31,572
You want us to do
a differential diagnosis

348
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,673
on Jesus?

349
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,408
Hears voices,

350
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:35,943
thinks he's the son of God.

351
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:37,511
Probably schizophrenic.

352
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,914
I think you offended him.

353
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:41,882
You're saying the patient's
religious extremism

354
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,751
could be a symptom.

355
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:45,886
A neuro disorder could explain
all his delusions.

356
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,021
Get an MRI
of his brain.

357
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,455
Let's see
if we can find God.

358
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:55,529
Heard you got
the daughter's file.

359
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,131
Patient change his mind?

360
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,668
I forged your signature.

361
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:03,804
Thank you
for your honesty.

362
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:05,873
Think of it
as a present.

363
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,809
See, somebody is about
to turn the big 4-5

364
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,678
in several months,
and somebody else

365
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:12,513
wants to make
a very big deal of it.

366
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:14,048
4-3.

367
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:15,950
4-3.

368
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:17,918
Are you sure?
Very.

369
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,321
How could I make
such a mistake?

370
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:22,990
In reading
your H.R. file?

371
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,059
Oh, no, wait,
I didn't.

372
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,027
And boom goes the dynamite.

373
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:28,829
Scores are tied.
We are even Steven.

374
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:29,997
<i>You're right.</i>

375
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:32,066
I did lie.
To H.R.

376
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,535
Not to you.

377
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:37,238
When I first applied
for the VP Admin job,

378
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,772
I was 29 years old.

379
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,374
I knew I would be taken
more seriously

380
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,710
if I were
in my early 30s,

381
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:43,811
so I added two years
to my age.

382
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:47,014
You lied
to make yourself older?

383
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,115
Are you lying
about being a woman?

384
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,317
Even if you can trap me,

385
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,920
you think I'll suddenly embrace
the value of lying?

386
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,255
My point is
you already have.

387
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:56,190
I just need to prove it.

388
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,863
Chickens aren't roosting.

389
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,698
She's just got a friend.

390
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,300
A guy she met
in an online support group

391
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,102
for cheating spouses.

392
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:09,670
I've heard
of that group.

393
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,406
It's called irony.

394
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:13,941
You think
she's cheating on her spouse

395
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,777
with someone from
a cheating spouse support group?

396
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,313
Sounds like the perfect place
to hit on vulnerable women.

397
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:20,614
Look.

398
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,017
<i>Multiple dense lesions.</i>

399
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:26,954
It looks
like M.S.

400
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,956
How did we miss M.S.?

401
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,992
It was hiding
behind the malnutrition.

402
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,594
M.S. attacks
the immune system.

403
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,095
No system,
no symptoms.

404
00:18:35,163 --> 00:18:39,199
And now we're feeding him,
so they're both back.

405
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:42,503
How are you feeling?

406
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,572
Terrible.

407
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,309
Obviously.

408
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,944
Where are your friends?

409
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:52,179
Still casting lots
for your clothes?

410
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:54,148
All I ask
is that they pray for me.

411
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:55,115
<i>Always sacrificing.</i>

412
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:57,751
Very inspirational.

413
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:00,120
The lesions
are in your temporal lobes.

414
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:01,655
When those areas
get messed with,

415
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,324
people have
strange experiences--

416
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:04,925
like hauntings,
alien abductions,

417
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:05,993
past lives.

418
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,661
Deals with God?

419
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,064
You didn't come
to see if I was better.

420
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:13,200
You came to see if your medicine
has turned me into an atheist.

421
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:14,835
I'd settle
for agnostic.

422
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,170
Faith is not a disease.

423
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:17,438
No, of course not.

424
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:19,540
On the other hand,
it is communicable,

425
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,275
and it kills
a lot of people.

426
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:33,087
I can't move my arm.

427
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:38,058
You feel that?

428
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:44,398
Your friends
are not praying hard enough.

429
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:47,771
<i>It's not M.S.</i>

430
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,940
Paralysis is a symptom
of M.S.

431
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:51,909
So are leg pain
and pseudobulbar affect.

432
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:53,177
He's getting worse
on the prednisone.

433
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:54,311
It's not M.S.

434
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,445
<i>The MRI was clear.</i>

435
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:56,814
He has lesions.

436
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:59,116
Could be an avm,
cerebral infarction.

437
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,351
<i>Let's put it to the vote.</i>

438
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:03,887
Vest or cummerbund?

439
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,289
Cummerbund.

440
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,524
You know me.

441
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:08,992
I can't say no
to any of you guys.

442
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,494
You're all correct.

443
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:11,662
<i>He has M.S.</i>

444
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,031
But not the friendly
Mr. Rogers M.S.

445
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:17,100
This is the weird guy
in the panel van kind.

446
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,135
Marburg M.S.?

447
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:19,837
What did I just say?

448
00:20:19,904 --> 00:20:22,005
He'll be dead in two
to three days at the most.

449
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:23,307
<i>That's unless we can get</i>
<i>someone</i>

450
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:24,908
to nail themselves
to a cross as soon as possible.

451
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:27,010
Or stem cell treatment.

452
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:29,046
That's
an experimental treatment.

453
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:31,348
That's had promising results
with demyelinating diseases.

454
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,950
It's our best shot.

455
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:35,018
It would be if it wasn't
embryonic stem cell treatment.

456
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:36,620
Our patient's right
of the pope.

457
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:37,721
<i>He's never gonna consent</i>
<i>to that.</i>

458
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,356
I know that,
and you know that.

459
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:40,724
He doesn't know that.

460
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:41,859
But now she knows that,

461
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:43,727
<i>he's gonna know that.</i>

462
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:44,761
Way to go.

463
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:46,663
Confirm marburg.

464
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:50,300
Then see if he's
a fair-weather flagellator.

465
00:20:58,409 --> 00:20:59,910
You look smashing,

466
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:01,211
Miss Moneypenny.

467
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,012
<i>Cummerbund?</i>

468
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,414
Very foolish, Mr. Bond.

469
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:06,917
The daughter's case checks out.

470
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:08,785
Stereotactic biopsy confirmed

471
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:10,787
stage iv glioblastoma
multiforme.

472
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:12,222
Doesn't respond
to chemo,

473
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,291
but they gave it
to her anyway

474
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,426
as a hail Mary
and just got lucky.

475
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:20,364
So either God intervened,
which is a lazy explanation,

476
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:22,065
or we just don't know why.

477
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:23,967
Which is no explanation.

478
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:26,637
Sometimes
there is no explanation.

479
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:28,171
And I'm just fine
with that.

480
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:30,007
Which annoys me to no end.

481
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:32,109
I need that file,
that chair,

482
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,360
and that desk.

483
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:41,651
Your woman
is fudging the facts.

484
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:43,353
Five of those cases,

485
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,555
the stated doses don't explain
the radiation damage.

486
00:21:45,623 --> 00:21:46,657
Sensitivities vary.

487
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:48,992
Not that much.

488
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,963
Yeah.

489
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:55,899
That's what I thought.

490
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:01,238
I asked her point blank
about this.

491
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:03,307
She said
the dosages were accurate

492
00:22:03,374 --> 00:22:05,075
and that she had done
nothing wrong.

493
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:08,278
'Cause morally she didn't.

494
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:10,614
All five patients
were terminal.

495
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:11,982
She exceeded
the dosing protocols

496
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,250
to try to save their life.

497
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:14,484
You would have done
the same.

498
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:15,919
She's a sap,
and she's perfect for you.

499
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,493
I hate rehearsal dinners
almost as much

500
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:25,862
as I hate weddings.

501
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,230
The only reason
anyone gets married

502
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:30,968
is that homo erectus females
needed protection

503
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:34,438
from predators
while breast feeding.

504
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:36,006
<i>The only reason</i>
<i>these two are getting married</i>

505
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:37,941
is to throw
an obnoxious gala

506
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:39,910
and make the rest of us
feel unworthy.

507
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:41,511
Even though we know
in two years

508
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:42,846
their lawyers
are gonna be fighting

509
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:44,448
over the Bentleys.

510
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:47,117
That'll make
a lovely toast.

511
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:49,453
She's got looks.
He's got money.

512
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,123
One of them is
bound to run out.

513
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:55,926
I give it 19 months.

514
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:58,362
That's very specific.

515
00:22:58,429 --> 00:22:59,796
No fault divorce in New Jersey

516
00:22:59,864 --> 00:23:03,750
requires couples to live
at least 18 months apart.

517
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:06,570
I'm actually only giving it
a few weeks.

518
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,905
Oh. Thought I was supposed
to be the dark one.

519
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:10,140
Not today.

520
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,541
Yeah.

521
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:16,780
You're gonna have
to go stag.

522
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:18,148
My patient
is refusing treatment.

523
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:20,517
And you care?
No.

524
00:23:20,585 --> 00:23:23,286
But it's an excuse
you can't argue with.

525
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:27,357
Accepting this treatment

526
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:29,760
is an insult
to God.

527
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:32,696
I can't expect him
to keep our deal.

528
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:33,764
You already broke it.

529
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,465
<i>Your blood test showed</i>

530
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:36,767
you were loaded
with ibuprofen.

531
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,668
Taking painkillers
breaks my deal?

532
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:39,803
The point
is to suffer

533
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:41,605
like your savior did,
right?

534
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:45,042
<i>Well, he didn't take myrrh,</i>
<i>the Tylenol of ancient Rome.</i>

535
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:46,643
And his nails went
through his wrists,

536
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:47,944
not through his palms.

537
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:48,979
Palms are for sissies.

538
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:51,114
<i>And what about the 39 lashes</i>

539
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:53,483
<i>and the beatings</i>
<i>and the crown of thorns?</i>

540
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:55,552
What you go through
is closer to a bad manicure

541
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,887
than a crucifixion.

542
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:58,555
It's not about showing God
my pain.

543
00:23:58,623 --> 00:24:01,058
It's about showing him
my faith.

544
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,959
If he asks me
to die for my daughter,

545
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:04,094
I'll do it gladly.

546
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:07,030
Don't make this
about your daughter.

547
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:08,632
You're just worried that
if we find a cure,

548
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,267
that it'll cost you
your faith.

549
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:11,268
And then you'll be
like the rest of us.

550
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:13,637
Alone and afraid?

551
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,205
You're right.

552
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:17,441
I don't want that.
You're smiling.

553
00:24:17,508 --> 00:24:18,442
Does that mean
that you're comfortable

554
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:19,643
with your choice?

555
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,545
Or that you're afraid?

556
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:22,846
Because this may be
your only hope.

557
00:24:22,914 --> 00:24:24,481
You can prescribe
a lot of things,

558
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:25,882
but hope isn't one of 'em.

559
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,217
Sticking by your convictions

560
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,686
and damning
the consequences.

561
00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:31,321
You two have a lot
in common.

562
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:34,558
You're both idiots.

563
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:43,366
All conviction's
equally ridiculous?

564
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:45,869
Just when they're applied
indiscriminately

565
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:47,671
to all circumstances.

566
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,239
He needs to see
his daughter.

567
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:51,041
He needs to see
<i>inherit the wind.</i>

568
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:53,977
And tell her he's dying
because God doesn't want him

569
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:55,879
to take his medicine.

570
00:24:59,534 --> 00:25:02,385
Honesty's not all bad.

571
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:04,821
Get her in here.

572
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:13,550
You don't have to die,
not if you take their medicine.

573
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:18,638
<i>The treatment</i>

574
00:25:18,672 --> 00:25:20,273
violates God's laws.

575
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,842
He doesn't want me
to take it.

576
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,278
But God doesn't want you
to die.

577
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:28,047
He doesn't want anyone to die.
He's all about love.

578
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:29,916
I know
this is coming from your mother.

579
00:25:29,983 --> 00:25:31,584
This is coming from me.

580
00:25:31,652 --> 00:25:32,785
I'm the one
who almost died.

581
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:35,354
I know
what it's like.

582
00:25:35,422 --> 00:25:38,591
And you're my dad.
You can't die.

583
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:41,627
I wish I didn't have to.

584
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:43,396
You don't have to,
daddy.

585
00:25:43,463 --> 00:25:44,564
Just take the medicine.

586
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:45,798
You always tell me
to take the medicine.

587
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:48,434
Please.

588
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:53,973
One day,

589
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,074
you're going to understand.

590
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:56,242
No, I'm not.

591
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,213
I am never going
to understand that.

592
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,982
If God could do this,

593
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,650
I hate God.

I just spotted
a couple of hot girls

600
00:26:33,146 --> 00:26:34,280
by the chocolate fountain.

601
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:36,916
Weren't you just upstairs
with...

602
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:38,718
And it wouldn't have happened
if not for you, buddy.

603
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,856
Someone had to distract
the sober friend.

604
00:26:43,924 --> 00:26:45,174
I'm not here
to be your wingman.

605
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:46,826
I'll be your wingman
this time.

606
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:49,028
I didn't come here
to get laid.

607
00:26:49,096 --> 00:26:50,129
Then don't.

608
00:26:50,197 --> 00:26:51,530
Talking to beautiful women

609
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:52,898
isn't nearly as much fun
as watching Taub

610
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:54,483
not talking
to his wife.

611
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:02,642
I went
through your emails.

612
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:05,211
There's nothing in there
that's inappropriate.

613
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,079
We're friends, Chris.

614
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:09,715
But you tell him things
that you've never told me.

615
00:27:09,783 --> 00:27:11,717
I tell him things
I can't tell you.

616
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:12,852
That's the point.

617
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:14,086
Not things about me.
About you.

618
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:15,921
About your new job.

619
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:17,823
About coloring your hair.

620
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,959
About how you felt
when your mother died.

621
00:27:20,027 --> 00:27:22,028
I want to know
those things.

622
00:27:22,095 --> 00:27:27,199
He's easy to talk to.

623
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,702
He's open and honest.

624
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,103
He makes me feel safe.

625
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:32,938
Sounds like you love him.

626
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:35,308
I am not having
an affair.

627
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,610
He lives in Oregon.
I've never met him.

628
00:27:37,678 --> 00:27:39,178
I probably never will.

629
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:41,447
You are having an affair.
An emotional one.

630
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:43,249
Are you equating
what I'm doing

631
00:27:43,317 --> 00:27:44,717
with what you did?

632
00:27:44,785 --> 00:27:46,819
I've done terrible things
to you,

633
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:49,055
and I deserve all of this
and more,

634
00:27:49,122 --> 00:27:51,857
but you can't pretend that
what you're doing isn't hurtful.

635
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,334
Someone looks lovely tonight.

636
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:03,102
Thank you.

637
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,372
I meant me.

638
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,809
Someone else
looks simply stunning.

639
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:13,679
That was you.
And the blonde at the bar.

640
00:28:13,747 --> 00:28:15,581
Just to be clear,

641
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:17,750
this whole little act
isn't gonna work.

642
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:20,119
I need an apology.

643
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:21,454
Not flattery.

644
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:23,189
It's not an act.

645
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:24,623
It's the wedding.

646
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:26,859
You hate weddings.
I thought I did.

647
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:28,494
Then I realized
I've never been to one.

648
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:29,862
Never?

649
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,131
Turns out
they're kind of fun.

650
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:35,301
Well, I can't complain
about my boss.

651
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:36,669
He's right here.

652
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:57,790
You're his boss?

653
00:28:57,858 --> 00:29:01,160
Um...

654
00:29:01,228 --> 00:29:04,497
I'm sorry
about your daughter.

655
00:29:04,564 --> 00:29:06,599
I never meant
to hurt her.

656
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,702
You just thought
she would change my mind.

657
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,373
I was surprised
she didn't.

658
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:17,543
So was I.

659
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:23,048
I didn't tell you the truth.

660
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:25,184
When I said
I'm not afraid to die.

661
00:29:25,252 --> 00:29:28,521
But you're going
straight to heaven, so...

662
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:30,823
That's what I believe,

663
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:32,658
but I'm human.

664
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:35,528
So you know
you may be wrong.

665
00:29:35,595 --> 00:29:38,664
How could you do
what you just did?

666
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:43,936
That's why we have beliefs.

667
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:46,005
So we can still see
the right thing to do

668
00:29:46,072 --> 00:29:48,441
when we're blinded
with doubt and fear.

669
00:29:48,508 --> 00:29:51,744
Our beliefs
define us.

670
00:29:51,812 --> 00:29:53,279
If we lose them,

671
00:29:53,346 --> 00:29:55,614
who are we?

672
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:05,191
Look, I'm sorry.

673
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:09,428
I didn't mean
for it to go that way.

674
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:14,033
You think
I'm being selfish,

675
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,736
but I'm not.

676
00:30:17,804 --> 00:30:21,440
He makes me feel better
about me and about us.

677
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:26,412
Well, that is hard
to believe,

678
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,615
because all I feel
right now is betrayed.

679
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:31,750
I never wanted that.

680
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:33,385
Good.

681
00:30:33,453 --> 00:30:37,289
Because just like you asked me
to stop my behavior,

682
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,658
I'm asking you
to stop this.

683
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:44,830
No?

684
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:46,732
I'm not gonna lie
to you.

685
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,601
Is this revenge?

686
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:51,437
I don't know.

687
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:52,972
But I do know
that it's something

688
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,908
I need right now.

689
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,152
What would you wear?

690
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:11,090
Well, I'm a sucker
for the white gown.

691
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:17,596
Traditionally
for young, first-time brides.

692
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,331
Well, I may not be young,

693
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,833
but I'll be first-time.

694
00:31:22,836 --> 00:31:26,839
That is a lie.

695
00:31:29,342 --> 00:31:31,477
You were married before.

696
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:35,314
1987 for six days.

697
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:38,651
Your knowledge
of New Jersey divorce law

698
00:31:38,718 --> 00:31:40,152
made me suspicious,
so I looked it up.

699
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,290
So this was all your trap?

700
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:46,892
Trap's primitive.

701
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,460
I prefer inveiglement.

702
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:50,496
Anyway, the point is,
I lied to you,

703
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:52,932
you lied to me,
I forgive you.

704
00:32:00,273 --> 00:32:03,208
Well played.

705
00:32:07,347 --> 00:32:08,948
You're tired,
aren't you?

706
00:32:09,015 --> 00:32:10,549
All those files?

707
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:11,634
No.

708
00:32:11,718 --> 00:32:13,802
No, I was thinking...

709
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:17,256
I mean,
if those two

710
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:19,675
even have the slightest chance
of making it,

711
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,361
then we have to be
a sure thing.

712
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:25,898
And we've already made
all our mistakes.

713
00:32:25,966 --> 00:32:28,867
And...

714
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:35,608
I've come to realize

715
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:38,377
that I love you even more
than I thought I did.

716
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:42,214
Sam,
will you marry me again?

717
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:47,720
Wow.

718
00:32:47,787 --> 00:32:49,622
I don't even know
what to say.

719
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:51,490
I have a suggestion.

720
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:53,192
Where did this even
come from?

721
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:54,994
When did you...

722
00:32:57,297 --> 00:33:03,135
You just came to realize
what made you love me even more?

723
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:05,804
Everything
you've done.

724
00:33:05,872 --> 00:33:08,607
Your work.
Your...

725
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:10,542
Your sense of morality.

726
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:15,247
The five cases.

727
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:17,116
I not only agree

728
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:18,217
with what you did.

729
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:19,351
I admire it.

730
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:21,020
I didn't do anything.

731
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:22,454
You already asked me
about the files.

732
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:24,657
And I told you the truth.
I know.

733
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:27,226
And I get it.

734
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:29,061
You don't believe me.

735
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:33,415
I believe that you
are a wonderful person.

No, Sam, listen.
I'm on your side.

738
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:43,375
I can't believe this.

739
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:44,710

A hat trick,
Chase.

750
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:22,715
See?
The life of the bachelor.

751
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:24,349
All of the sex,
none of the guilt.

752
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:26,919
It's not over, okay?

753
00:34:26,986 --> 00:34:29,288
I just really miscalculated.

754
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:31,857
I thought she'd forgiven me
for everything.

755
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:34,293
All those hurt feelings,

756
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,131
they never really went away.

757
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,300
That makes a lot more sense.

758
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:43,302
Ignore him.

759
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:48,040
He just got an idea.

760
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:49,808
I have one more test
to run.

761
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,614
Ugh.
I hate weddings.

762
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:17,603
It won't be long now.

763
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,506
You'll be staring down the
yawning void before you know it.

764
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:23,442
You came from a wedding
to tell me that?

765
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,311
Nope.
I came from a wedding

766
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:28,447
to run a PET scan.

767
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:29,815
I thought
you'd given up on me.

768
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,216
I have.

769
00:35:31,284 --> 00:35:33,452
PET scan was for your daughter.

770
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,054
I was wrong
about her.

771
00:35:36,122 --> 00:35:40,893
She did have glioblastoma.

772
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,494
And she still does.

773
00:35:42,562 --> 00:35:45,864
The cancer never went away.

774
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:47,766
Yes, it did.

775
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,234
They tested her
every year.

776
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:52,004
With a CT scan.

777
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:54,439
Which misses
all the tiny, little tumors

778
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:55,641
that a PET scan doesn't.

779
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,075
You've made a mistake.

780
00:35:57,143 --> 00:36:00,245
She does not
have cancer anymore.

781
00:36:00,313 --> 00:36:01,613
I ran it twice.

782
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:06,451
No mistake.

783
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,187
Looks like God broke
your deal.

784
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:14,760
I'm sorry.

785
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:16,995
But I'm also right.

786
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:23,669
You're a bastard.

787
00:36:29,142 --> 00:36:30,843
Do whatever you want to me.

788
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,746
Good call.

789
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:41,317
Surprised you've got enough
strength to come to work today.

790
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:44,354
36 hours is long enough
for me to recover.

791
00:36:44,405 --> 00:36:47,123
And not nearly long enough for
this guy to be getting better.

792
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:50,777
House wanted us checking
every 12 hours anyway.

793
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:52,762
Sorry I took off on you.

794
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,297
Twice?

795
00:36:54,365 --> 00:36:55,365
First one was my bad.

796
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:57,801
Second one,
I had no choice.

797
00:36:57,868 --> 00:36:59,235
It was a threesome.

798
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:03,173
They're overrated.

799
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,776
He's bluffing.

800
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:08,595
Get house.

801
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,847
Got something to show you.

802
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:12,816
Your daughter's PET scan.

803
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:15,652
It's clean.

804
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,987
<i>She's fine.</i>

805
00:37:18,055 --> 00:37:21,324
My bad.

806
00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:23,593
Got her mixed up
with Marion Silver.

807
00:37:23,661 --> 00:37:26,196
<i>Marisa Silva.</i>

808
00:37:26,263 --> 00:37:27,864
That's believable, right?

809
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:30,400
<i>Anyhow, good news for you,</i>

810
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:31,868
bad news for Mr. Silver.

811
00:37:31,935 --> 00:37:33,169
<i>You tricked me.</i>

812
00:37:33,237 --> 00:37:34,804
God didn't break our deal.

813
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:37,140
I did.

814
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,242
You led me
into temptation.

815
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,710
<i>And I followed.</i>

816
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:42,245
And God will punish you
for that.

817
00:37:42,313 --> 00:37:44,147
He has to.
<i>'Cause if he didn't,</i>

818
00:37:44,215 --> 00:37:45,832
well, that would
make you wonder, wouldn't it?

819
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,250
He will.

820
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:49,285
Well, that's
why I'm so confused

821
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,120
by this.

822
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:53,223
This is your MRI.

823
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,425
<i>Shows incremental improvement.</i>

824
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:57,794
You're getting better.

825
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:59,929
I double-checked the name
on this one.

826
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:02,031
But it's not all good news.

827
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:06,302
This patient is screwed.

828
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,738
Technical term
is dead as a doornail.

829
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:10,473
Who is that?

830
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,741
God.

831
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:13,877
<i>You broke your deal</i>
<i>with him,</i>

832
00:38:13,944 --> 00:38:15,945
your daughter's fine,
you're getting better.

833
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:17,280
Nothing bad happened.

834
00:38:17,348 --> 00:38:19,382
<i>Which can only mean</i>
<i>one thing.</i>

835
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,785
There is no God.

836
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:25,188
Of course, if your daughter
gets hit by a meteorite today,

837
00:38:25,256 --> 00:38:27,090
I would have some serious egg
on my face.

838
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,393
<i>You're smiling.</i>

839
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:33,129
I assume
that means you're miserable.

840
00:38:33,197 --> 00:38:38,301
It means
I'm happy.

841
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:40,236
It doesn't mean
God doesn't exist.

842
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:42,372
It just means he's--
he's truly merciful.

843
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:46,676
<i>My beautiful Marisa</i>
<i>was right.</i>

844
00:38:46,744 --> 00:38:48,878
God is all about love.

845
00:38:48,946 --> 00:38:50,146
Punishment is proof of God,

846
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:53,049
and no punishment
is proof of God?

847
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:54,951
Ingenious argument.

848
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:58,454
Faith isn't an argument.

849
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:03,560
I'd like to see my daughter.

850
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:15,805
Everyone else knew?

851
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:17,607
Everyone I could trust.

852
00:39:17,675 --> 00:39:19,876
So yes.

853
00:39:19,944 --> 00:39:23,279
If you had told me,
he'd be dead by now.

854
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:25,982
So why do I still want
to tell the truth?

855
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,185
Either you're naive
or you have scruples.

856
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:30,720
I'm not sure
which is worse.

857
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:35,758
This is insane.
We can't work like this.

I was wrong.
