00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:18,727
"The Patuxent River
Naval Air Station near D.C.

2
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:22,403
<i>Was commissioned in 1943
by John McCain's grandfather."</i>

3
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:26,163
I'm thinking of going
hang gliding.

4
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:28,918
Pax river is,
like, completely flat.

5
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:32,241
Think that's why they tested
the V-22 Osprey there.

6
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,162
I like naval stuff.

7
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,126
I like their oranges and lint.

8
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:41,149
<i>What looks like kidney
disease, but isn't?</i>

9
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:43,282
<i>And where's Chase?
Root canal and Berger's.</i>

10
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,495
The first one
was regarding Chase.

11
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:45,972
Root canal, if done correctly,

12
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:48,488
doesn't look like
kidney disease.

13
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,277
Got a case for you.

14
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:52,019
Smells funny.

15
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,292
Patient had an idiopathic
anaphylactic reaction.

16
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:55,519
It stumped two E.R. docs

17
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:56,868
and an immunologist
from Johns Hopkins.

18
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:58,964
Patient went from
asymptomatic to fried kidneys

19
00:00:59,005 --> 00:00:59,948
in less than a year.

20
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,564
Stumped three internists

21
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,185
and a department chair
from Harvard.

22
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,082
14-year-old girl,
intermittent attacks.

23
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:09,612
Four-year-old boy,
consistently at death's door.

24
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:18,853
This patient died
five years ago.

25
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:23,804
I didn't say which side
of the door he was on.

26
00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:29,241
The fact that he's dead
makes it more interesting.

27
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,714
Four-year-olds
do not die of Berger's.

28
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:37,968
I thought it was relevant.

29
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:39,639
Death is a consequence,
not a symptom.

30
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:45,131
If it's not a symptom,
it's not relevant.

31
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:46,570
<i>Shouldn't we be
trying to maximize</i>

32
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,174
what we can save here?

33
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:50,502
14-year-old,
your freom, our asses?

34
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:56,994
Right...
Save your asses.

35
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,743
House S08E07
"Dead And Buried"

36
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:08,434
By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es
==SPREAD THE WORD==

37
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:33,922
She was in a car accident
when she was two.

38
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:36,517
She only had minor injuries,
but her father died.

39
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:38,556
That was 12 years ago.
You think that's pertinent?

40
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,560
No, I think it's sad.

41
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:45,449
She got sick in the middle
of her 14th birthday party.

42
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,112
Which is sad and pertinent.

43
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,457
Maybe she was opening a present

44
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:49,860
that triggered the reaction.

45
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:51,815
- Where's House?
- Pissing contest with foreman.

46
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,417
Last thing she ate
was strawberry cake,

47
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:55,773
<i>but allergy tests
for everything were negative.</i>

48
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,022
Do you like your dentist?

49
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:58,572
I'm still going
to my pediatric one.

50
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:01,126
What's your dentist's name?

51
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:02,444
Williams.

52
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:04,174
<i>What if it's not
an allergic reaction?</i>

53
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:05,435
<i>Hereditary angioedema</i>

54
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,775
or systemic mastocytosis

55
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:07,774
could mimic anaphylaxis.

56
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:09,309
You're not sure of his name?

57
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,646
You just saw him this morning.

58
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:13,272
His assistant's name is Angie.

59
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:14,466
<i>Her home number is...</i>

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,821
Normal complement studies.

61
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,029
<i>No skin leons.</i>

62
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:18,455
You had a manicure.

63
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,393
This is fresh!
You weren't at the dentist.

64
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:22,041
Why would you lie about that?

65
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,590
To avoid having
this conversation.

66
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:25,102
<i>- Elevated BP.
- What about pheochromocytoma?</i>

67
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:26,718
Or an anaphylactoid reaction,

68
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,712
which could be triggered
by certain opioids.

69
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,275
You've had your hair cut
three times since I've met you.

70
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:32,112
You can't be embarrassed
about a manicure.

71
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,851
There's gotta be
a deeper reason.

72
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:35,056
Did House give you homework?

73
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:36,103
She's not on any meds.

74
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:37,247
Haven't you heard?
Everybody lies.

75
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:38,725
And the tox screen was clean.

76
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,619
<i>Feel free to jump in
at any time.</i>

77
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,262
We'll check
catecholamines for pheo

78
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,199
and run an expanded
opioid panel.

79
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,704
You see what the patient
says about drug use

80
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:50,533
when her mother's
out of the room.

81
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,463
No, never.

82
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:56,783
Nobody's here
to bust you, iris.

83
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:58,769
We just need to know if...
No, I already told you.

84
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:02,624
I just take vitamin C
sometimes.

85
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:05,227
What exactly were you doing
when you had your reaction?

86
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:09,469
Opening a birthday present.
The magic 8 ball.

87
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,698
The joke gift, not the cocaine.

88
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:12,877
Is that it?

89
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:17,245
Certain drugs could
explain her reaction.

90
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,390
What kind of drugs?

91
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:23,941
What kind did you have in mind?

92
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,758
Iris has always been
a moody girl.

93
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:31,805
And now that she's a teenager,
it's gotten worse.

94
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:34,441
So for the past few months
I've been...

95
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,094
Giving something to relax her.

96
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:39,365
Diazepam.
I tell her it's vitamin c.

97
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,846
Being normal
is very important to iris.

98
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:45,467
She couldn't handle the thought
of being on meds.

99
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:47,711
Anti-anxiety medications
would explain it.

100
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,108
If we keep her off,

101
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:52,600
she'll be moody, but healthy.

102
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:56,984
Or it's something else.

103
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:05,562
I need to DDX
a patient with you.

104
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,828
I thought you had
a team for that.

105
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:07,701
<i>According to foreman,</i>

106
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,320
they're only for DDXing people

107
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:12,323
who are still alive.

108
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:14,701
You have a dead patient?

109
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,290
Bigotry is boring
when we add modifiers.

110
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,130
I don't see creed, LOR, pulse.

111
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,801
Foreman will find out
you're taking this case,

112
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,844
and he'll bust you.

113
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,012
But you know that,

114
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,977
<i>which means...</i>

115
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:30,349
You want to go back to jail...

116
00:05:30,384 --> 00:05:32,366
<i>Because it's the one place</i>

117
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:35,996
you're unable to iulge
your self-destructive habits.

118
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:38,103
<i>Yeah, it's much
more likely that I'm</i>

119
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,863
taking this case because I miss
showering with cro-magnons

120
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,084
than that I actually happen
to find it interesting.

121
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:46,284
Four-year-old kid.

122
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:48,874
His kidneys died,
they transfused.

123
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:52,305
His lungs died.
He died.

124
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,763
<i>Have you seen
bride of the monster?</i>

125
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:55,462
I just got the ed wood box set.

126
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:57,280
What if the chicken
was the egg?

127
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,868
What if the lung involvement
came first?

128
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:00,229
I don't really
care about the movie.

129
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:01,670
I just don't want
to indulge your...

130
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:02,748
Lupus.

131
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,424
Because this is
a bad idea, House.

132
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:07,309
If the kid had a rash

133
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:09,144
or some circulation issue...

134
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,951
Damn!

135
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:14,677
I just realized I'm late

136
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:16,941
for my anger management class.

137
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:22,191
<i>Traffic, for sure.</i>

138
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:24,324
<i>Taxes.
Definitely taxes.</i>

139
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,953
Spoiled grandchildren.

140
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:27,234
Platitudes.

141
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:31,670
Any others?

142
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:33,743
And I lose my temper
when someone suggests

143
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:36,093
that a handful of pop-psych
catch phrases

144
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,242
can control our most seminal,

145
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:40,978
<i>intractable, and natural reacon</i>

146
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,626
to a dead child.

147
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:48,014
Am I right, Emory?

148
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,691
I don't think Emory
wants to share right now.

149
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:55,669
<i>They blew it, didn't they?</i>

150
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,662
They missed your son's rash.

151
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:58,973
A faint one, on his cheek.

152
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:01,229
He didn't have a rash.

153
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:03,636
I think we should talk about
Lena's grandchildren.

154
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:04,658
They're alive.

155
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,735
Was he sensitive to sunlight?
No.

156
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:08,479
Greg...
Cold fingers and toes?

157
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,396
No!

158
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,271
Wegener's granulomatosis.

159
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:22,526
I need to examine your son.

160
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,749
You're a bit late
for that... You ass.

161
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,636
With you
and your wife's consent,

162
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,528
we can get an exhumation order.

163
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,985
Find out what killed him.

164
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:33,501
Ex-wife.

165
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,678
And you'll never
get her consent.

166
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,176
She's moved on...
New hub, new kid.

167
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:39,608
She wants nothing to do
with drew's death.

168
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:41,042
Or me.

169
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:46,813
You're angry because
your kid died.

170
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:47,882
More than that,

171
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,363
because you don't
have an answer.

172
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,537
People need answers.

173
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,168
He's in a crypt
at St. Jude's Cemetery.

174
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,717
You feeling any
pain or cramping here?

175
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:12,735
A bit.

176
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:15,565
But not just there, um...

177
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,209
Here.

178
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:18,564
<i>Breast tenderness.</i>

179
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,273
Have you been having
regular periods, iris?

180
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:22,948
Not really.

181
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,407
What is it?

182
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,061
I think we should
run a pregnancy test.

183
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:29,434
Iris isn't sexually active.

184
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,230
She doesn't even
have a boyfriend.

185
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,313
Pregnancy would explain
all of her symptoms.

186
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:34,785
Can even cause
some unpredictable

187
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:36,133
<i>allergic reactions.</i>

188
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,764
How can I be pregnant
if I've never even had sex?

189
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,431
We just need a drop of blood.

190
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:45,309
What's the matter?

191
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:46,806
<i>My...</i>

192
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,998
My arms.

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,594
I can't feel my arms.

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,626
At this rate,

195
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,626
I'm gonna need to pick out
a plot for myself.

196
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:04,785
Thanks to your
generous donation,

197
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,064
you have all morning.

198
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:08,120
More like 13 minutes.

199
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:11,828
Before we proceed
any further, doctor,

200
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,648
I'd like inquire
as to exactly what procedure

201
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:16,761
you intend to perform
on the remains.

202
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:18,989
Have you ever heard
of the north American

203
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:21,406
man/dead boy love association?

204
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:26,646
I consider these grounds
to be a holy place,

205
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:29,744
and I would ask you to observe
them with due decorum.

206
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,425
So you're taking bribes
to plunder graves,

207
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,824
and I need to show respect.

208
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,073
I think they got
the cause of death wrong.

209
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:41,992
And if I find a hole
in the cartilage of his nose,

210
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:43,221
right about here,

211
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:44,614
then it means I'm right.

212
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:49,757
Please be respectful.

213
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:57,780
I prepared the sarcophagus
for you.

214
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:02,201
Thank you, Igor.

215
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:03,806
It's Milton.

216
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:52,893
You owe me a new pair of pants.

217
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:59,281
<i>- She is pregnant.
- Test came back positive.</i>

218
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:03,062
So... She lost
the use of her arms

219
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,761
and her innocence.

220
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,490
A vengeful God?

221
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:09,122
Or...

222
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,746
<i>Cerebral tumor.</i>

223
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,196
<i>Vasculitis.</i>

224
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,485
<i>Ms.</i>

225
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:22,787
I gather from the silence

226
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,763
<i>that Chase isn't there.</i>

227
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,090
Nope, I'm here.

228
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:26,119
Where are you?

229
00:11:26,346 --> 00:11:27,776
<i>"Nowhere"...</i>

230
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:29,542
<i>He said cryptically.</i>

231
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:33,604
<i>I assume you concur
with the diagnosis.</i>

232
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,165
Absolutely.

233
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,553
<i>Even tugh
there are three diagnoses?</i>

234
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,251
<i>And ms and vasculitis</i>

235
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:42,552
<i>usually get better
with pregnancy.</i>

236
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:44,388
Yeah, I was saying
I agreed with the other one.

237
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:45,754
He's had his eyebrows waxed.

238
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,202
<i>I met a woman</i>

239
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:48,656
<i>who likes her men well groomed.</i>

240
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:50,446
All over?

241
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,400
I assume, from the silence,

242
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:57,284
that Chase has had a brazilian.

243
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:59,368
Cool.
Interesting.

244
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:00,405
Ouch.

245
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:11,084
Question is...
Is this really about a woman?

246
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:12,607
<i>Or is it about
something more profound?</i>

247
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:14,602
Another question is,
could the paresthesia

248
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:15,918
be caused by an std?

249
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,568
<i>HIV-related
mononeuritis multiplex.</i>

250
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:23,521
I gatherrom the silence

251
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:26,092
that either you all
agree with Chase

252
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:28,988
or you're just staring
at his emasculated brow.

253
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:32,016
In either case, test for HIV

254
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,139
and do an MRI
to rule out tumors.

255
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,910
And check Chase
for testosterone.

256
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:59,706
<i>Blood work was
negative for HIV.</i>

257
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:03,041
All the money's on tumor.

258
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:05,158
How was the brazilian?

259
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,255
It was fine.
Hurt a bit.

260
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,801
<i>What about House's theory?</i>

261
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:09,879
Why'd you really do it?

262
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:11,050
'Cause I'm vain and shallow.

263
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,221
And you weren't before?

264
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:13,711
<i>The girl I was seeing wasn't.</i>

265
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:14,872
There's nothing profound here.

266
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:17,609
No tumor, either.

267
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:18,731
It's not her brain.

268
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,553
Everything looks good.

269
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,929
What's the matter?

270
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,357
My arm, it's...

271
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,493
Still nothing?

272
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,771
No, now they're sore.

273
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,239
Paresthesia's gone.

274
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:44,499
Could the bruising be caused
by a physical trauma?

275
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:46,902
You think she fell
out of bed, repeatedly?

276
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,413
A blood disorder.
Maybe thrombocytopenia.

277
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:51,325
A vitamin K deficiency
or scurvy

278
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,492
could explain
bleeding problems,

279
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,415
and prnancy
could exacerbate it.

280
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:57,668
Boys, do a home search.
Girls, do lab tests.

281
00:13:57,705 --> 00:14:00,666
I'm pretty sure
that's not sexist.

282
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,502
Where have you been?

283
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:04,143
Picking up dry cleaning.

284
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,889
Filling up the tank.
Violating the dead.

285
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,182
If you don't believe me,
call the monitoring company.

286
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,525
<i>I did.</i>

287
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:13,118
Unfortunately, the Patuxent
River Naval Air Station

288
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,787
was GPS testing
and disrupted the signal,

289
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:20,028
at the exact, same 45 minutes
you weren't here.

290
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:22,189
Well, if I'd known I had
45 minutes of freedom,

291
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:23,556
I'd have gone hang gliding.

292
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:24,867
I admire the creativity.

293
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:27,525
What happens when
the stunt doesn't work?

294
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,864
Think you're gonna have
to pay off a bet?

295
00:14:28,912 --> 00:14:31,430
Think I'm gonna
triple your clinic hours?

296
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:32,730
I'm gonna call your P.O.,

297
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:35,028
and you're gonna
go back to jail.

298
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,911
<i>There are mees'
lines on his fingernails,</i>

299
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:47,385
<i>so now I'm thinking
heavy metal poisoning.</i>

300
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:49,006
You're an addict.

301
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,094
And I'm an idiot for thinking
that your addictions

302
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:53,312
were limited to pills,
anti-social behavior,

303
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:54,572
and sarcasm.

304
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:55,921
Sorry.

305
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:57,569
Vicodin repeating on me.

306
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,649
You're also
addicted to puzzles.

307
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,738
You show all
the classibehaviors.

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,185
Lying, neglecting
responsibilities,

309
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:05,435
and you can't stop,

310
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,255
no matr how devastating
the consequences.

311
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,824
Working on a medical case
is not a parole violation.

312
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:11,309
It's my job description.

313
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:12,825
Your job description

314
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:14,982
is doing what foreman
tells you to do.

315
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:16,422
<i>Never mind
bride of the monster.</i>

316
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:19,412
<i>You need to watch Norma rae.</i>

317
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:20,984
<i>Before we get started,</i>

318
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:22,236
<i>I just want to thank you all</i>

319
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:23,665
for agreeing to relocate.

320
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:26,074
Um, I had an appointment
in this part of town,

321
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:27,585
and I absolutely didn't want
to miss this meeting.

322
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,327
<i>But, uh, thank you.</i>

323
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,588
I'm buying.

324
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,343
Not literally.

325
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,597
Hey, Emory,

326
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,028
should we, uh,
powder our noses?

327
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,717
Hey, did you know
your ex-wife

328
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:46,182
still lives right
behind this place?

329
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:51,330
She finishes work at 4:00.

330
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:53,267
Picks up her new kid
at 4:15.

331
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:56,360
Gives us about 20 minutes.

332
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,688
I made some calls.

333
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,901
It's amazing what
people will tell you

334
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:03,026
if you ask brutally enough.

335
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:04,699
Was that table here?

336
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:11,124
Some kinds of
pressure-treated wood

337
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:13,861
can contain arsenic.

338
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:15,705
We shouldn't be here.

339
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:17,852
We don't have a choice.

340
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:20,714
This is the only way
you're gonna get your answer.

341
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:24,693
<i>Does your ex leave
a spare key anywhere?</i>

342
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:26,232
How did he look?

343
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:36,763
Peaceful.

344
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,060
Vitamin k deficiency's a bust.

345
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:43,602
Fridge has more spinach
and broccoli

346
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:44,917
than a farmer's market.

347
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:46,662
The brazilian...

348
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,552
You said it hurt
"a bit."

349
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,902
You've had one?

350
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,218
More than one, and you haven't.

351
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:55,233
They hurt all your bits.

352
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:56,528
That's my dark secret.

353
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:59,189
What's yours?

354
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:00,927
I had the nails
and eyebrows done,

355
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,133
but that's it.

356
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:04,790
I just needed to create
a distraction, though.

357
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:06,794
I met a TV producer
at a dinner.

358
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:10,536
She asked me to appear
on the medical segment.

359
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,849
Screen tested it yesterday
and shot it today.

360
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,086
You're a TV doctor?

361
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,579
It's a one-off.

362
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:18,032
<i>When's it air?</i>

363
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:20,235
Two hours ago.

364
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,314
Otherwise, I'd still be lying.

365
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:23,729
This is what she was opening

366
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:26,161
when she had her attack.

367
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:31,478
Will anyone believe Chase
is an actual doctor?

368
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:33,215
"Don't count on it."

369
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:38,203
Huh.

370
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:46,817
She does have a boyfriend.

371
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:48,332
Love letters.

372
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:52,756
<i>Porn.
The nasty kind.</i>

373
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,126
Torture, rape...
Animals.

374
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:59,144
Sweet kid.

375
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:55,147
This is all that's left.

376
00:19:57,105 --> 00:20:00,041
One box in the bottom
of a closet.

377
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,748
Ohh.

378
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,481
He used to wear
those stupid things

379
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:17,960
all the time.

380
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:21,488
Used to have
to pretend I was scared.

381
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,068
Made in the people's
Republic of Lead Paint.

382
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,647
Back door.

383
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,093
Let's get out of here first.

384
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,968
We need to catch
the end of our class.

385
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:43,068
I met him at school.

386
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,908
He was the only boy
that liked me.

387
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:47,694
It's a little more than like.

388
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,981
We haven't had sex.

389
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,501
Oh, come on, iris.
You're pregnant.

390
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,038
So I'm just lying
about everything?

391
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:55,876
<i>Well, you lied
about the boyfriend.</i>

392
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:58,144
You obviously lied about sex

393
00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:01,053
and this... Garbage.

394
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:02,085
They're his.

395
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,489
He can't keep them
at his place.

396
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:06,548
Well, I'm glad
we could be so accommodating.

397
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:09,438
What else don't I know?

398
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:20,061
Honey...

399
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:21,538
What is it?

400
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,406
He came here last night.

401
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:30,153
<i>And he told me I should leave.</i>

402
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:33,184
But I didn't
want to, and he got mad.

403
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:36,800
He hit you?

404
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:37,549
Physical trauma.

405
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:39,208
<i>Explains the negatives
of the blood disorder.</i>

406
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,305
We should call the police.

407
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:42,764
I won't tell them anything.

408
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,127
That's ridiculous.

409
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:46,201
<i>He beat you!</i>

410
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:52,825
What is it?

411
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,541
It's getting hard to see.

412
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:56,678
What the hell
is happening to me?

413
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:06,074
Rubbing alcohol, vinegar.

414
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:09,227
Not sure what this is.

415
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:11,841
Aren't there
actual medical tests?

416
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:14,799
Dead patients usually
get a lower standard of care.

417
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,446
Pink means lead.

418
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:18,319
Orange means Mercury.

419
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:21,666
And rust means arsenic.

420
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:23,230
<i>And what's brown mean?</i>

421
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:25,044
Scotch.

422
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:06,303
He used to call him
"deezer."

423
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,483
<i>He couldn't say "zebra."</i>

424
00:23:09,517 --> 00:23:11,218
He'd have his own words
for everything.

425
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:17,960
We called 'em "drewisms."

426
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:21,108
How does your ex-wife do it?

427
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,223
How come she's not...
Angry and miserable?

428
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:32,197
She treated it
like it never happened.

429
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:35,344
She never even cried.

430
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:38,354
Not even at his funeral.

431
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:39,576
I was a mess,

432
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:44,014
and she just sat there like...

433
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,278
A statue.

434
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:54,036
We have a problem.

435
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:55,695
Does it limp?

436
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:02,951
Why do you care
if he works on two cases?

437
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:04,514
'Cause next,
it'll be three cases,

438
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:05,964
then four.

439
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,958
Then animal cases
and ghost cases.

440
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:09,659
Then animal ghost cases.

441
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:11,545
Assuming, of course,
we are talking about House.

442
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:14,218
You're just setting yourself
up to fail.

443
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,716
He has a lot more
to lose than I do,

444
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,222
and he knows that.

445
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,667
He's rational.

446
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,784
No, he's not.

447
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:21,562
He's the most rational man
I've ever met.

448
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:23,081
Annoyingly so.

449
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,259
He isn't gonna put himself
back in jail over a dead kid.

450
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:27,366
He's an addict,

451
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:28,646
and he will
put himself back in jail

452
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:31,218
over a puzzle.

453
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:32,674
He'll back down.

454
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,054
Halfway through
the perimetry exam,

455
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:41,197
her tunnel vision went away.

456
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,490
<i>She can see perfectly.
TIA.</i>

457
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:45,736
The word "transient"
is right there in the name.

458
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:50,941
Ah, here we go.

459
00:24:55,081 --> 00:24:56,703
Chesa, after giving

460
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:57,788
the pics an eye or two,

461
00:24:57,908 --> 00:24:59,621
I can confirm
that Lauren's surgeries

462
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:01,480
cost her some big bikkies.

463
00:25:01,514 --> 00:25:02,911
<i>Not only was there a gut tuck,</i>

464
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:05,350
<i>nose tuck, and arse tuck,</i>

465
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,838
but her new, fake norks
stick out

466
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:07,843
like nuts on a mutt.

467
00:25:10,561 --> 00:25:11,762
The original script was...

468
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:12,589
<i>Shh, shh, shh.
Anyone notice...</i>

469
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:14,771
He's enlightening us.

470
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,174
<i>That's 'cause he's retooled
the ol' todger.</i>

471
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:18,742
Let's just hope
no one cut the wrong wire, eh?

472
00:25:24,832 --> 00:25:27,018
So you just wanted
to look pretty on TV.

473
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,500
Question is,
why did he want that?

474
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:30,205
Clinic time.

475
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,207
What do you want us to do?

476
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:35,713
MRA 4 TIA.
ROFL.

477
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:38,550
Thought you only had clinic
on Tuesdays.

478
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,182
Oh, you're right.

479
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:46,385
Hi. I'm here
for the free flu shot.

480
00:25:46,387 --> 00:25:47,651
I got a call saying...

481
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:49,170
I'm here to find out why
you didn't care about

482
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:50,228
your first kid.

483
00:25:50,262 --> 00:25:54,095
Losing a child...
Just breezed right through it.

484
00:25:54,145 --> 00:25:55,731
How do you know about
my first kid...

485
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:57,684
Didn't even squeeze out
a single tear at the funeral.

486
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:58,638
Where are you getting this?

487
00:25:58,672 --> 00:25:59,601
You couldn't wait
to squeeze out

488
00:25:59,653 --> 00:26:01,907
a brand-new
replacement kid.

489
00:26:04,206 --> 00:26:06,317
Damn it.

490
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,536
You had no right to say that.

491
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:08,914
I know.
I deserved the slap.

492
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,820
But I was hoping that
you weren't capable of it.

493
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:13,817
Apathetic hyperthyroidism.

494
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:16,458
Could have kidney involvement.
Could be genetic.

495
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,083
Definitely causes apathy.

496
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:20,501
I was hoping that
your lack of emotion

497
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:22,172
was a symptom of something
you could have passed on

498
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,120
to your first son.

499
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,536
You know Emory.

500
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:30,978
We belong to the same club.

501
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,238
He wants to relive this.

502
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:33,315
I don't.

503
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:35,143
So I heard.

504
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:44,509
Emory was a wonderful man.

505
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:47,023
Never afraid to show
his emotions.

506
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:48,739
Which is great,
most of the time.

507
00:26:48,846 --> 00:26:50,842
But when drew died...

508
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:54,105
It overwhelmed him.

509
00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:56,029
I vowed I wouldn't
let that happen to me.

510
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:58,213
That's why you left him?

511
00:26:58,247 --> 00:26:59,753
<i>I left because of his eyes.</i>

512
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,761
He had drew's eyes.

513
00:27:07,762 --> 00:27:09,332
Who used to babysit drew?

514
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:11,321
My father, but...

515
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:12,467
His place or yours?

516
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:17,256
There are two types of people.

517
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:18,770
<i>Those who can move on,
and those who can't.</i>

518
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:20,941
<i>My father keeps up
a good front,</i>

519
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:22,607
<i>but he's just like Emory.</i>

520
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,596
<i>You need to leave him alone.</i>

521
00:27:24,632 --> 00:27:27,456
So he has two types
of people inside of him.

522
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:39,903
Mra was normal.

523
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:41,040
Yeah, how did...

524
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,365
I found out where
your boyfriend lives.

525
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:45,382
When I paid him a visit,
he took off.

526
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,293
Ran in front of a car.

527
00:27:47,413 --> 00:27:48,506
You're lying.

528
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,357
He's down in the E.R.
right now.

529
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:51,905
Shut up, you lying
sack of crap.

530
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:53,608
Iris!

531
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:55,585
How do you know I'm lying?

532
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:57,510
<i>How do you know
your boyfriend's okay?</i>

533
00:27:57,638 --> 00:27:59,879
'Cause I'm right here,
you dick.

534
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:08,763
Iris has dissociative
identity disorder.

535
00:28:08,797 --> 00:28:11,158
Also known as multiple
personality disorder.

536
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:14,549
Are you saying I'm crazy?

537
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,434
It's the mind's response
to a severe trauma.

538
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,835
A person experiences something

539
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:19,639
<i>that's too difficult to accept,</i>

540
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:20,915
so they create
alternate personalities

541
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,276
that don't have to accept it.

542
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,791
Some think it's quite
a natural reaction.

543
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,938
Iris hasn't had
any severe traumas.

544
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,053
The car accident?

545
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:29,920
I was two.

546
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:32,155
I don't remember anything.

547
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:35,593
These personalities
that I'm supposed to have...

548
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:36,827
Where are they?

549
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:38,845
They only come out
when you're afraid or anxious.

550
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:41,455
That's why House used
the hurt boyfriend story.

551
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:42,515
<i>But if there's no boyfriend,</i>

552
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:44,020
<i>where did
the bruises come from?</i>

553
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,263
The pregnancy?

554
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:49,022
When you say
your boyfriend hit you,

555
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,400
<i>it means you actually
hit yourself.</i>

556
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:54,041
<i>And the pregnancy...</i>

557
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:56,052
<i>Doesn't take a boyfriend.</i>

558
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:57,785
<i>Just a boy.</i>

559
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,505
<i>You may not be aware</i>

560
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,321
of half the things you've done.

561
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,267
How could this be happening

562
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:12,317
<i>to my own daughter
without me knowing it?</i>

563
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,904
Diazepam was masking it.

564
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:15,988
Taking her off
made it more apparent.

565
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,824
But I... I wasn't on...

566
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:18,969
"Diazepam"?

567
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:20,857
What is that?

568
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:30,734
That's what those
vitamin pills were.

569
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:34,378
<i>Iris... I am so sorry.</i>

570
00:29:34,498 --> 00:29:36,475
<i>I just... I thought
you were moody.</i>

571
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:40,905
<i>I didn't want you to think
you needed medication.</i>

572
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:44,736
Oh, my God.

573
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,896
I n't believe
how stupid I've been.

574
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:52,020
We need you to help us
with something.

575
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:55,132
Different alters can he
different apparent symptoms.

576
00:29:55,182 --> 00:29:57,720
<i>Allergies, paresthesia,
vision loss,</i>

577
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,473
changes in blood pressure.
Do you think I'm making this up?

578
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:01,853
Your symptoms are real.

579
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:03,216
But some are physiological,

580
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,927
and others are psychological.

581
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,578
So there's something
wrong with her...

582
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:09,483
In addition
to the multiple personalities?

583
00:30:09,548 --> 00:30:11,139
Yes, but we won't know what

584
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:14,560
until we access her alters
and compare their symptoms.

585
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,747
Well, how do you do that?

586
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,558
Hypnosis.

587
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:22,304
Foreman's nogonna back down.

588
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:24,616
He's not an idiot.

589
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,694
Yes, he is.

590
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,179
Just like you.

591
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:28,203
If you keep being stubborn,

592
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:29,757
he will keep being stubborn.

593
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,796
Eventually,
you will screw something up.

594
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,716
Which will be bad news
for both of you.

595
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:38,755
But... Only one of you
will be in prison.

596
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:42,402
It just isn't worth it, House.

597
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,059
Okay.

598
00:31:45,757 --> 00:31:47,277
Uh, y-yes, sir.

599
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:49,100
I... yes,
I know I told you

600
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,111
that I had a chiropractor's
appointment,

601
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:54,366
but, uh, I got a flat.

602
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:56,493
I know, right?

603
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:58,000
So...

604
00:31:58,034 --> 00:31:59,994
You know,
don't send out the marines.

605
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:03,347
I should be back on the road
in a few minutes.

606
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,595
Okaybye.

607
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:11,930
Dr. James Wilson,
county coroner.

608
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:13,385
I'd like to ask you
about your grandson,

609
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:15,697
drew lemaine.

610
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,462
What did he do
when he was here?

611
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:34,670
Where did he play?
What did he eat?

612
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,590
We watched lot of TV.

613
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,150
And ate biscuits.

614
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:43,123
<i>Did you give him sidewalk chalk?
No.</i>

615
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:45,487
Finger paints?
No!

616
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:46,962
A sandbox?

617
00:32:46,996 --> 00:32:48,732
It's like I said.

618
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:50,848
We watched a lotta TV.

619
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,311
You expecting someone?

620
00:32:58,388 --> 00:32:59,631
What?

621
00:33:03,686 --> 00:33:05,904
Dr. Wilson my ass!

622
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:07,868
I told you to leave him alone,
you son of a bitch!

623
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:10,042
Temper trigger.

624
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:16,688
<i>Who am I talking to now?</i>

625
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:19,364
<i>Nobody.</i>

626
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:22,048
<i>You must be somebody.</i>

627
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:24,571
I'm too little.

628
00:33:24,574 --> 00:33:27,488
Nobody sees me.

629
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:30,207
Nobody knows I'm here.

630
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:34,432
<i>BP just went to 140 over 90.</i>

631
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,023
What is it?

632
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:37,770
My arms.

633
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,116
You can't feel them?

634
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:44,460
It's okay.
We can fix that.

635
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:46,251
Do you hurt anywhere else?

636
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:48,900
Not right now.

637
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:51,489
<i>But you used to hurt?</i>

638
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:56,488
When I ate strawberries.

639
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,527
And when I remember...

640
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,618
<i>Do you remember being hurt?</i>

641
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,185
I remember everything.

642
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:25,100
<i>Baby...</i>

643
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:28,730
It's going to be okay, baby.

644
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:55,345
Iris?

645
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:57,583
Why didn't you ever tell me?

646
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:02,171
It was my fault daddy died.

647
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,573
Oh, no. No.

648
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:05,182
Yes, it was.

649
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:07,349
I was crying
and he couldn't drive.

650
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:08,473
It was my fault daddy's...

651
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:10,503
Oh, no.
No, no, honey.

652
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes.
You were just a baby.

653
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,260
It wasn't your fault.
No, shh.

654
00:35:14,284 --> 00:35:15,692
Oh, baby.

655
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,263
It was my fault.

656
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,063
I'm sorry, mommy.

657
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:20,651
<i>Shh.</i>

658
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,224
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

659
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,662
<i>It wasn't a miscarriage.</i>

660
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:36,975
Test shows
she's still pregnant.

661
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:40,850
<i>Okay, cross out everything</i>

662
00:35:40,884 --> 00:35:42,292
<i>that doesn't appear
in every alter.</i>

663
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:45,560
When she opened
the magic 8 ball,

664
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,543
that triggered a switch
to a personality

665
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:48,733
<i>with a strawberry allergy.</i>

666
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,852
Pregnancy, vaginal bleeding,

667
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:50,889
and elevated b.P.

668
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:52,111
Could be pre-eclampsia.

669
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:54,023
Worst case, could be
an ectopic pregnancy.

670
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:55,606
We need to ultrasound.

671
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:07,016
Not seeing an embryo
in the fallopian tube.

672
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,469
I'm not seeing
an embryo anywhere.

673
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:13,811
Which idiot
did the egnancy test?

674
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:15,318
I did one of them.
Chase did another.

675
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:18,201
Taub did a third.
Three tests, three positives.

676
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,232
What happened to your eye?

677
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:21,542
I grabbed park's ass.

678
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,284
Exoplanets.

679
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:26,087
I think he said exoplanets.

680
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:27,385
Wait for it...

681
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,719
We can't actually see them...

682
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,429
But we infer their existence

683
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:33,604
because of the effect they have
on the star they orbit.

684
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,507
Pregnancy test only
infers an embryo's existence

685
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:38,785
because of elevated hcg levels.

686
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,157
Which could also be caused
by choriocarcinoma,

687
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:42,453
which affects the placenta,

688
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:43,744
<i>mimics pregnancy,</i>

689
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,590
<i>and causes elevated BP
and vaginal bleeding.</i>

690
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:46,976
Occult choriocarcinoma,

691
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:49,846
which is why we didn't
see it on the ultrasound

692
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,981
tell all the alters

693
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:53,088
that they have cancer.

694
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:06,604
<i>Mom or dad?</i>

695
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,073
Mom, dad, and mom's dad.

696
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:12,106
The good news is,

697
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:15,081
made me realize
that you were right.

698
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:16,356
I can't drop it.

699
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:20,311
But now that I accept that,

700
00:37:20,345 --> 00:37:21,969
I feel much less conflicted.

701
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:25,093
I've ruled out wegener's,
Berger's, heavy metal poison...

702
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:26,686
Two trains
are about to collide,

703
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,553
and I'm trying
to talk them out of it.

704
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,732
Feels like
I'm missing something.

705
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:30,749
<i>No, no.</i>

706
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:31,898
You don't want to listen to me,

707
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:33,995
then I don't want
to listen to you.

708
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:35,343
<i>That is so fifth grade.
I agree.</i>

709
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,076
And you know why?

710
00:37:37,108 --> 00:37:38,481
Because I'm just as bad as you.

711
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:39,992
I knew ts would fall
on deaf ears,

712
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:43,025
but I just kept
talking and talking.

713
00:37:43,218 --> 00:37:45,404
You're right.

714
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:49,250
You don't even know
what I just said.

715
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:50,666
That is ridiculous.

716
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,989
You said, "blah blah
blah blah blah, deaf ears,

717
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:54,212
blah blah blah blah blah."

718
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,579
Absolutely essential
information.

719
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:12,853
Ray...

720
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:14,521
Ray!

721
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:15,997
Leave him alone.

722
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,949
What are you doing to him?

723
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,947
It's okay.

724
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,674
<i>Mickey...</i>

725
00:38:20,705 --> 00:38:22,045
You? You brought him.

726
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,244
I asked him to meet me here

727
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:24,692
for a family reunion.

728
00:38:24,714 --> 00:38:26,382
Ray!

729
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:27,597
Let's just get
out of here, okay?

730
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,944
I know what killed your son.

731
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,948
You don't get it, do you?

732
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:31,064
I don't care what killed him!

733
00:38:31,098 --> 00:38:32,437
It's called alport syndrome.

734
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:33,654
It's a genetic condition

735
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,625
characterized
by kidney failure,

736
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,077
bronchial myomas, mees' lines,

737
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:38,726
and deafness.

738
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,175
Idiot. Drew wasn't deaf!

739
00:38:40,393 --> 00:38:41,799
<i>House...
Son of a bitch!</i>

740
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:42,801
Get away from them!

741
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:44,175
House, House!

742
00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:45,732
It's a genetic condition!

743
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:47,398
Shut up!
Genetic!

744
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:53,065
Your father has the gene.

745
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,210
So do you.

746
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:57,455
It's grandpa's slight deafness

747
00:38:57,489 --> 00:38:58,594
that gave the game away.

748
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:00,497
You're apparently asymptomatic.

749
00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:04,013
You could still pass
the gene onto your children.

750
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,497
Plural.

751
00:39:10,322 --> 00:39:11,629
You're lying.

752
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,896
He has high-frequency
hearing impairment.

753
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,841
And so did drew.

754
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,104
That's why drew
made up his own words.

755
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,276
'Cause he couldn't
hear properly.

756
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:31,460
It's okay.
Now that we know what it is,

757
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,006
he'll need treatment,
but he'll live.

758
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,017
You know, there are platitudes
that can help you with that.

759
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:14,872
I miss him too.

760
00:40:52,005 --> 00:40:53,755
She's responding well.

761
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:12,984
Cuddy threatened him
with clinic duty.

762
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:14,560
I thought
threatening him with jail

763
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:15,721
would be different.

764
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,462
Not an irrational thought.

765
00:41:19,496 --> 00:41:22,789
I'm still sending him back.

766
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:24,442
He saved two lives.

767
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:26,425
Which means it's too late
for me to back down.

768
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:28,050
<i>It's no longer my choice.</i>

769
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,801
It's just me telling him
he can get away with anything.

770
00:41:32,568 --> 00:41:35,649
I have to send him to prison.

771
00:41:42,913 --> 00:41:47,048
Your job is to keep
this machine running.

772
00:41:47,182 --> 00:41:50,051
It's your choice
to make House a useful tool

773
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:51,708
or a monkey wrench.

774
00:41:51,745 --> 00:41:54,519
Cuddy's way didn't fail

775
00:41:54,521 --> 00:41:56,584
because she didn't
try to control House.

776
00:41:56,618 --> 00:41:58,466
She managed him.

777
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:04,513
She knew better than anybody
what a tool he could be.

778
00:42:36,461 --> 00:42:39,000
What would Cuddy have done?

779
00:42:42,696 --> 00:42:44,735
Ten clinic hours.

780
00:42:48,943 --> 00:42:50,984
Cuddy's not here anymore.

781
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:53,251
You got 30.

782
