1
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,588
You have a patient waiting.
See?

2
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:46,330
- I'm waiting for a follow-up.
- If you're talking about Mr. Casdin,

3
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:48,620
he has a "deceased"
sticker on his file,

4
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:52,176
as do all the other follow-ups
you have scheduled for today.

5
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,731
I had colds all winter.

6
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:10,092
Well, I've been in this room awhile,
but it's spring now, right?

7
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:11,426
I feel run-down

8
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,031
like maybe something big
is coming on.

9
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:16,663
Run-down.
Come on, give me something.

10
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:18,433
- Sore throat?
- No.

11
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:20,782
- Runny nose?
- No. I know it sounds weird,

12
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:24,786
I'm a nurse, but could you run
maybe a CBC or thyroid up.

13
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,930
Dr. Cuddy, I need a consult.

14
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:42,532
Until she stops seizing,

15
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:44,984
I may as well go back to my office
and get my diagnosis on.

16
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,564
She's urinating on herself.

17
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,983
She's having a seizure.
If she hadn't peed...

18
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,201
It's green.

19
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:55,902
Interesting.

20
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,037
House - Season 5 Episode 18
" Here Kitty"

21
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:09,101
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm

22
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:27,396
The HTeam's AnonymHouse

23
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:30,177
35-year-old woman.

24
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:33,065
Head of nursing at an old-age home.

25
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,446
Neurological symptoms and "P"?

26
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:40,117
Oh, green pee.
I get it.

27
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:41,330
Nice.

28
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:44,174
"Neuro" is also written in green.

29
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,891
Does that mean she has green
neurological symptoms as well?

30
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,865
From now on,
I'm gonna use two colors.

31
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,226
- Green indicates irony.
- Pseudomonas infection.

32
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:53,019
She'd have a fever.
Toxins?

33
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:54,799
Why are we taking this case?

34
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:56,926
Welcome, your lordship.

35
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,094
We were just preparing
your morning briefing.

36
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:00,495
Sorry I'm late.

37
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,848
And, yes, green pee does meet

38
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:06,452
the only diagnostic requirement
you care about, it's interesting.

39
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,270
But is it worth us taking this case?

40
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:10,564
"Us" aren't taking anything.

41
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:12,399
I'm taking.
You're accepting.

42
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:14,819
Okay, I accept.

43
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:16,946
She has adult-onset epilepsy,

44
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,197
and she really likes
those St. Patrick's day beers.

45
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:23,685
Go check out the house and the office
for toxins and infections.

46
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,459
Her neuro exam was normal.
No subsequent seizures.

47
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:29,041
It's not life-threatening.
It's not important.

48
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:31,557
Luckily neither are you.

49
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:41,859
You okay?

50
00:03:42,326 --> 00:03:43,222
I'm fine.

51
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,070
You and House this morning,
the way you were arguing.

52
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:50,768
Airing disagreements
doesn't qualify as arguing.

53
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:52,572
Come on, man.

54
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,734
I'm just trying to help.
We're friends.

55
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:59,661
There are 400 Japanese teenagers
you were playing Halo with last night

56
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:01,413
you're better friends with.

57
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:04,838
Your avatar should ask
their avatars how they're doing.

58
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:07,037
I consider you a good friend

59
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,047
even if we don't hang
that much outside work.

60
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:14,044
- I wasn't arguing with him.
- You kinda were.

61
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:16,469
Fine, I was.

62
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:19,087
And you know what, I was right.

63
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:21,950
You got conned.
Methylthioninium chloride.

64
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:24,386
Notable side effect, green urine.

65
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:27,588
She's a nurse. She knows the dosage.
Knows how to fake a seizure.

66
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:30,150
She pees pea soup and gets
the warm attention of doctors

67
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,347
all week long.

68
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,152
She's a Munchausen,
and you're her mark.

69
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:35,143
So you're insight
is based on discovering

70
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:37,568
an anti-alzheimer's drug
at an old-age home.

71
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,433
No reason
it'd be sitting in her desk.

72
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:42,378
You ever tried to pee on yourself
in public? It's not easy.

73
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:44,783
Sorry, I rushed the jewish frat.
We peed in private.

74
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:46,361
For good reason.

75
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,377
I can spot a fake seizure.

76
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:51,238
Which means this was real.
Which means...

77
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:52,875
her problem is phenol.

78
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:54,960
Carbolic acid?

79
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:58,088
Yeah, maybe she
accidentally inhaled some

80
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,923
at a gout treatment facility
circa 1890.

81
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,075
It's still in some
antiseptic throat sprays.

82
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,304
She's been chugging it
all winter for her colds.

83
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,429
Phenol explains the seizure
and the urine.

84
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,231
She'd have to drink 5 bottles a day.

85
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:11,616
I'm sure you won't have trouble
discovering evidence of it

86
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,401
when you search her house.

87
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:14,438
Bye.

88
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:19,107
And you can start her on
charcoal hemoperfusion

89
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:20,982
for the phenol poisoning.

90
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,364
Seriously?

91
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:27,215
You were lying
about the throat spray.

92
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,744
That does make more sense.

93
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,580
So why are you wasting Taub's time?

94
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,081
I don't want him to know that

95
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:36,448
I'm wasting my time disproving
his fake seizure theory.

96
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:37,573
Zip.

97
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:45,407
Chris?

98
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:47,846
Chris Taub, right?

99
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:50,672
Neil Zane.

100
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:53,500
I was two years under you
at Collegiate High, remember?

101
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,550
Sure.

102
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:56,438
So you're some big doctor here now?

103
00:05:57,228 --> 00:06:00,025
I'm a doctor.
You?

104
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,922
I was speaking at an Econ course
over at the University.

105
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:04,947
I tripped and banged my leg.

106
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:08,215
I have some time.
Come with me.

107
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,124
Hi.
Tests back?

108
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,457
Head CT was negative.

109
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:20,435
What about a thyroid up take
or abdominal ultrasound?

110
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,585
Sure.

111
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:24,591
How'bout I flash some lights
in front of your face first?

112
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:26,670
You want me to have another seizure?

113
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:29,304
We're gonna have to give up the room
unless we can confirm a problem.

114
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Okay.

115
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:55,414
Damn it.

116
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:56,879
Oh, God.

117
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:59,668
Please forgive me.
I'm so sorry.

118
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:01,343
What are you worried about?

119
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,406
Maybe a night in jail for fraud.

120
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,507
I've to go tell one
of my employees he was right.

121
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:08,361
I'm not a Munchausen.
I'm gonna die unless you help me.

122
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:10,539
You'll have to come up
with something more original.

123
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,480
A cat predicted my death.

124
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:18,081
Cats make terrible doctors.

125
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:20,253
Oh, no, wait, that's women.

126
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:21,628
You're screwed.

127
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:26,401
How'd you slip?

128
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:29,876
I've had this dizziness
problem for a while now.

129
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,595
You get checked for labyrinthitis?

130
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,297
On antibiotics for a week.

131
00:07:33,422 --> 00:07:34,622
No difference.

132
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:37,345
- Lie down a sec.
- I'm dizzy.

133
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:39,153
That's normal.

134
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,134
- So what are you teaching?
- Entrepreneurship.

135
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,211
I'm a CEO, Osttech Industries.

136
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:46,590
We make medical devices.

137
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,708
All right, you can sit up.

138
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,772
So did that tell you anything?

139
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:52,992
Did I...

140
00:07:54,753 --> 00:07:55,803
Oh, my God.

141
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,666
The... you just cured me.

142
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,843
I figured you had
a tiny calcium deposit

143
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,222
in your inner ear;
I just shifted it around.

144
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:05,964
I've seen three doctors for this.

145
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,376
I'm buying you dinner.

146
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,036
- Forget it.
- Come on.

147
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:12,635
I'm also in investor in a club.
We'll make it a night out.

148
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,035
No, I'm married, boring.

149
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,762
I know some married
people who aren't boring.

150
00:08:19,462 --> 00:08:21,812
A few years back, I was one of them.

151
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:23,627
Good luck.

152
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:33,902
If you're gonna kill me and rape me,
please do it in that order.

153
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:36,572
This is the cat, Debbie.
Have you heard of her?

154
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:37,539
Debbie.

155
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:40,408
- Sorry but without a last name...
- She was in the news.

156
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,102
We found her as a kitten.
She lives in the nursing home.

157
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:45,649
She only sleeps next to people
when they're about to die.

158
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:47,651
Ten patients in the last year.

159
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:49,820
And then yesterday she did it to me

160
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,025
while I was sitting on my couch.

161
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,491
Please, the whole staff,
the doctors even,

162
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,201
we all know this is real.

163
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:57,870
Can you come back later?

164
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:00,497
I have some business I'm conducting
with the Prince of Nigeria.

165
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:04,334
Just watch this video.

166
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,211
It'll prove I'm not lying.

167
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:10,714
Dr. House, I'm begging you.

168
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:19,230
Chest.

169
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,175
Quick!

170
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,689
Before she goes without
attention for eight seconds.

171
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:33,864
She's faking.
The cat told me.

172
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Listen.

173
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,192
Soft breath sounds.

174
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,830
Means it's bronchospasm.

175
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:46,293
Can't fake that.

176
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:04,234
When Debbie climbs on a patient's bed
and goes to sleep,

177
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,345
we call the loved ones
and tell them to come in.

178
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,274
- You want to treat her?
- She's a nutjob.

179
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,192
Don't we all have quirks?

180
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:14,038
Aren't those eccentricities
what make us human?

181
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,949
It's like Debbie's here on earth
to bring people to the other side.

182
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,482
The doctors we spoke to
also agreed the cat...

183
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:21,157
Nutjobs get sick too.

184
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:24,185
So you think...

185
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,911
this cat story is nonsense.

186
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,762
And you admit she faked
her earlier symptoms.

187
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:32,172
But you still think
she's actually sick now?

188
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:35,384
Well, anything would sound ridiculous
If you said it in that voice.

189
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:38,679
Confirm she's faking
or I'm gonna have to kick her out.

190
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:41,682
- There's that voice again.
- I'll give you 24 hours.

191
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:45,102
Consecutive?

192
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:53,442
What are you doing?

193
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,383
No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.

194
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:59,523
- Bronchospasm, go.
- Bronchitis.

195
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:01,074
No cough, no fever.

196
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:03,527
- And Blofeld didn't smoke a cigar.
- He might have.

197
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,647
Dude had a lair.
Means he was rich.

198
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,161
Rich people enjoy a good stogie.

199
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:11,628
Sometimes send them as gifts.

200
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:14,837
Hey, Taub, did that sound
like I was awkwardly

201
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:17,009
trying to segue into making a point?

202
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:19,209
Yes.
Emphysema.

203
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:21,102
Lungs were clean on the CT.

204
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,342
Dogs can be trained
to predict diabetic comas,

205
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,606
epileptic seizures;
they can smell cancer.

206
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,613
It is possible there's
something in this cat.

207
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:29,942
It's more possible
that it was just a coincidence.

208
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,819
10 million nursing homes.
100 million pet cats.

209
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:34,738
One of them was bound
to pick a few winners.

210
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:37,573
Debbie was able to predict there was
something wrong before you were.

211
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,984
Is that a coincidence too?

212
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:41,161
Maybe the cat
didn't predict anything.

213
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:44,450
- Might have caused the deaths.
- We shoulda listened to Ted Nugent.

214
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:47,962
Yeah, it could be cat scratch fever
or visceral larva migrans.

215
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,105
Maybe he didn't kill everyone
at the nursing home,

216
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,599
but it may be killing Morgan.

217
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:54,478
The worms hop from the cat
to the cat lady's lungs.

218
00:11:54,603 --> 00:11:57,007
- I could buy that.
- Those cigars were for me.

219
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:00,354
Hey, that reminds me,
why is some fancy CEO

220
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,729
sending you a box of Cuban cigars?

221
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:06,016
- Is it related to your money worries?
- What money worries?

222
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:09,391
Extrapolating from the fact that
he's been skipping his morning muffin,

223
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:13,273
I'd say that he lost almost all
his money on the market last year.

224
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:15,275
I'm on a diet.

225
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,631
I'm also extrapolating
from the online portfolio

226
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:21,856
you forgot to log off,
but it's mostly the muffins.

227
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,368
Scope her for worms in the lungs.

228
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:32,791
We could help out in there.

229
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:33,837
Yeah,

230
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,214
it takes at least four people
to look inside a crazy woman's lungs

231
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,779
for imaginary worms.

232
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:40,926
So you're in a good mood again.

233
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,096
You need another speech about
what a great friend I am?

234
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:49,757
I'm telling my wife
we don't need to downsize,

235
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,672
but maybe we do.

236
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,082
- You really lost all that money?
- I don't care about the money.

237
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:59,209
- I just feel bad for Rachel.
- She married a guy in one situation

238
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,352
and ended up with another;
that's hard on anyone.

239
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:02,269
Thanks.

240
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:04,652
Makes me feel much better
hearing my wife's a gold digger.

241
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,868
No, I just meant she married
this master of the universe,

242
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:10,420
successful surgeon,
and now he's basically,

243
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:12,999
you know, a flunky
for this mad scientist...

244
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,235
who saves lives, so that's good.

245
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,736
There are no worms in the lungs.

246
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:26,727
- What else could cause bronchospasm?
- Severe acid reflux.

247
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:30,089
- No esophagitis. It's not reflux.
- Why are you pushing a crash cart?

248
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,258
Because patients sometimes crash.

249
00:13:32,383 --> 00:13:34,415
And they haven't yet invented
a crash tractor

250
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,482
for me to drive
wildly around the hallways.

251
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:41,278
Why are we in
the coma patients' room?

252
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:48,452
You actually think the cat
is going to predict someone's death?

253
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,039
No, I know the cat the not going
to predict anyone's death.

254
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,119
Then I will have
scientifically disproved...

255
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:56,219
You didn't keep
this patient despite the cat.

256
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:58,051
You kept this patient
because of the cat.

257
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,203
You're scared
there's something to it.

258
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:04,194
If I could prove the non-existence
of an omniscient God

259
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:06,428
who lovingly guides us
to the other side, I would.

260
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,646
Cat version's gonna have to do.

261
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,977
- Are you scared?
- Cats brains are always in alpha mode.

262
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,454
The scientific tests
that have seemed to confirm

263
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,857
physic phenomena,
that's where it takes place.

264
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:21,721
Please tell me that you were kidding
so I won't have to fire you.

265
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:22,945
I was kidding.

266
00:14:23,827 --> 00:14:26,442
We still have a human patient, right?
Airborne allergens possible?

267
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,700
- Skin test was negative.
- Lungs may be more sensitive.

268
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:30,979
Or House just screwed up.

269
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:34,443
If you misinterpreted the breath sounds
as soft instead of loud,

270
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:36,791
it's laryngospasm instead
of bronchospasm,

271
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,653
which you can get from a simple panic
attack, which she was having.

272
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:43,757
- I also heard the lung sounds too.
- You saying I screwed up?

273
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:47,418
"Screwed up"
is maybe too harsh, but yes.

274
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:51,348
- Don't you want to check their charts?
- Of course not.

275
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,058
This is a double-blind.

276
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,337
I don't want to even
subconsciously signal

277
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,988
to Teddy which one's the sickest.

278
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,405
Her name's Debbie.

279
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,331
Are those welts on that guy's arm?

280
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,146
Were they here when we got here?

281
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,720
He has a severe cat allergy.

282
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,655
That never happened.

283
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:17,439
Look at Debbie.

284
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,339
Good news, mister...

285
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Limpert,

286
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,238
when you don't die tonight

287
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,341
you will finally have done
something good for the world

288
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,267
as opposed to your life as a...

289
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,018
fireman.

290
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:40,816
Foreman's airborne allergen
theory makes the most sense.

291
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,358
Do a methacholine challenge
on catgirl to check it out.

292
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,072
I told you to get rid
of "death cat".

293
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:56,973
- Do you see a cat?
- I see a litter box.

294
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,666
This is a disability, Dr. Cuddy.

295
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:03,149
- Can't make it to the toilets on time.
- On the mice too?

296
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,496
Well, now you see the mice
actually prove that I don't have a cat.

297
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:08,996
Are these...

298
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:13,554
are these the genetically
modified lab mice from oncology?

299
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,787
Genetically modified for tastiness.

300
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:21,790
Get rid of the cat,
and get rid of your patient.

301
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,156
My team's doing
a methacholine challenge.

302
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:26,526
Your team just completed
a methacholine challenge,

303
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,126
which came up negative.

304
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:30,496
Who told you about the test?

305
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,949
I'll never say, but yes.

306
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:35,702
Her airways clamped down.
I heard it.

307
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:38,406
We kick her onto the street,
it could happen again.

308
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,816
I wish there was a lawsuit cat.
It could warn you.

309
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:43,091
I'm sorry,
but if you won't escort her out,

310
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:45,516
I'll have to get security to do it.

311
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:57,114
You're joining me
for a good-bye smoke.

312
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,439
I don't smoke.

313
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,101
Fine.

314
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,950
If you don't want the seventh graders
to think you're cool.

315
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:10,744
I went through your purse.

316
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,207
Horoscopes.
Good luck charms.

317
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,932
You went to a good college,
good nursing school.

318
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:18,203
So you weren't always
a superstitious idiot.

319
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:21,011
- I'm not a super...
- How'bout four years,

320
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,080
that sound right?

321
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,752
That's when you switched
from a family insurance plan

322
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:28,672
- to the one you're on now.
- I was married. I got divorced.

323
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:31,633
Two years before that,

324
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:33,832
you got chicken pox shots,

325
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,684
which you only get in adulthood
when you have a kid.

326
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,307
Or I should say when you had a kid

327
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,992
because no kid
has come to visit you.

328
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:44,824
Which all makes me think
something bad happened.

329
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,940
It was my stepson, Timothy.

330
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:57,040
What happened?

331
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:58,705
He was in school.

332
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,413
He was having his morning snack.

333
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:02,837
And he choked.

334
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,510
And the teacher saw it,

335
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:08,122
and they did everything
that they were supposed to.

336
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,379
He shouldn't have died.

337
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:13,717
You want to make it make sense.

338
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,805
What's wrong with that?

339
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,725
It's meaningless, is what's wrong.

340
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:26,061
What's wrong is that it doesn't do
a thing to bring your kid back

341
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,445
or put you and your ex
together again.

342
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:35,196
Rash on your neck.

343
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,014
Probably not enough for Cuddy.

344
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:43,269
I can't breathe.

345
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:44,394
Hey, doc.

346
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,297
Breath sound soft to you, doc?

347
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:53,633
Hooray!
You're officially sick.

348
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:02,140
Churg-Strauss fits best.

349
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,894
Here's the plan...
Taub, you change the litter box.

350
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:08,469
This is pathetic.

351
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:12,567
You're still punishing me for calling
you out on the green urine lady?

352
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,360
This is for ratting me out to Cuddy.

353
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,239
I'm not asking you to apologize,
just scoop some poop out of a box.

354
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,101
Just clean it.

355
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,819
- Let House do it.
- Yeah, that'll happen.

356
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:26,729
He won't just continue to let
our room smell like cat pee.

357
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:29,188
I'll clean it next time.

358
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:31,837
I'm outta here.

359
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:42,642
Now that you've delivered
that important lesson,

360
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:44,557
I'm gonna go test the patient.

361
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:50,260
What, you think your bag's
gonna die now?

362
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:51,853
Now you're punishing me

363
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:54,129
because you think I'm superstitious?
What do you care?

364
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:56,306
It's not so much
about me caring per se.

365
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,263
It's more about me wondering
why you're such a credulous idiot.

366
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:02,740
Thirteen, start the patient on steroids
for the Churg-Strauss.

367
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:05,593
Unless we have something
we need to argue about.

368
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:13,744
This is good stuff.

369
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:15,116
The best.

370
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:18,651
It's made from the distilled sweat of
recently laid-off hedge fund managers.

371
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,885
- Aren't you happy you came out tonight?
- Yeah.

372
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:25,162
I wasn't actually going to,
but not the greatest day at work.

373
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:29,058
I used to have an office like this.

374
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:32,228
- Used to?
- When I was a plastic surgeon.

375
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:34,731
But one day I took stock
of my life and...

376
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
screw it.

377
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:43,420
I had an affair with the daughter
of one of my partners.

378
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,510
They signed a non-disclosure.
I signed a non-compete.

379
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:48,445
And the funny thing is

380
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,540
I wound up telling my wife anyway.

381
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:56,113
You like your job?

382
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:57,921
Same as you.
Same as everyone.

383
00:20:58,428 --> 00:20:59,757
It has its ups and downs.

384
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,000
You're lying to make me feel better.

385
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:06,996
Yeah, it's the best.

386
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:08,827
I'm in charge, you know?

387
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,544
I'm a kid with toys.

388
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:13,397
Speaking of which,
what do you think of the prototype?

389
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,672
It's amazing.

390
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:17,474
Gotta make it
a half-inch smaller though.

391
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:20,231
- You serious?
- I got small hands,

392
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:23,448
6.5 gloves, like women surgeons,
which are your fastest-growing market.

393
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:27,705
Meaning the girls would have to use
two hands to hit the switch.

394
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:31,544
Why do I bother paying
the idiots that work for me?

395
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:35,196
Put down that crap you're drinking,
because I am

396
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,993
breaking out the really good stuff.

397
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,970
What's wrong?

398
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,658
I went to the bathroom.
My urine...

399
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:57,690
- green again?
- It's brown.

400
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,774
I didn't do anything, honest.

401
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:09,987
"I'm just a girl who can't say no."

402
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,285
It is possible she's still faking.

403
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,187
She didn't fake
the for the bronchospasm.

404
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:18,337
You think she's faking
some stuff but not other stuff?

405
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,671
Maybe she's "unchausen".

406
00:22:19,887 --> 00:22:22,693
I'm just saying the brown
urine doesn't make sense.

407
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,159
- What?
- Nothing.

408
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:36,020
We've ruled out every
possible cause for brown urine.

409
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:39,087
No blood in the urine.
Liver and kidneys fine.

410
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,388
- Brown could be fecal. A fistula...
- we checked.

411
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:44,516
How do we know the urine
is still brown?

412
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:46,781
Had to be.
Once you've gone brown...

413
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:51,708
if we've ruled out everything
that can make the urine brown,

414
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,625
what if it just looked brown?

415
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,750
If the green dye never left her system,
what plus green makes brown?

416
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:00,332
Purple.

417
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,840
Strep bovis infection
from colon cancer.

418
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,493
Paraneoplastic syndrome
would explain the bronchospasm.

419
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,553
We scoped her
when we checked for the fistula.

420
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,071
There's no tumor.

421
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:14,683
I wasn't scared
by the umbrella either.

422
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:18,383
What? Not everything's
about you, kutner.

423
00:23:18,508 --> 00:23:21,300
I realize it's stupid.
I just... I don't know everything.

424
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:23,197
- I don't want to invite...
- Great,

425
00:23:23,322 --> 00:23:26,112
'cause I thought your superstitiousness
had to do with your folks being killed.

426
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:28,438
But "you're stupid"
works just as well.

427
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:33,102
Why is there a ladder here?

428
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:36,525
Forgot that one.

429
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:39,427
Scopes don't work as well
as pillcams.

430
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:42,061
Give her one.
Find the tumor.

431
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,923
Come with me, tiny Taub.

432
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,132
Sorry I was late again.

433
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,426
I've got a long commute
from the poor house.

434
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,030
Knew it when I hired you.

435
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:11,480
You'd eventually Miss the money,

436
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:14,441
being the big shot
like your new CEO friend,

437
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:17,795
if that nightclub stamp on your hand
is any indication.

438
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,860
- Don't worry, I'm not quitting.
- I know.

439
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,779
Guy who signs a non-compete instead
of just telling his wife that he cheated

440
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:26,911
- doesn't have the guts to quit.
- Bad example. I did tell her.

441
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:29,151
From guilt, not from courage.

442
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:32,315
And bravely running to Cuddy
behind my back.

443
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:35,627
Arriving heroically
to work every day.

444
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:37,892
Cowards make lousy employees.

445
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:40,532
Maybe you're a coward,
maybe you're quitting.

446
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:42,491
Either way, I'm screwed.

447
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:55,461
You will note how
faster pussycat kill, kill

448
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:58,086
has snuggled up
by coma guy over there.

449
00:24:58,642 --> 00:25:01,592
And more importantly,
she did yesterday as well.

450
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:03,793
And he's still breathing.

451
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:05,681
We done?

452
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,179
Thank you for showing me this.

453
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:27,032
But maybe she's just confused
in this new environment.

454
00:25:30,176 --> 00:25:33,352
In 1844, a preacher
in upstate New York

455
00:25:33,477 --> 00:25:37,077
added up some dates in the bible
and predicted Jesus' return.

456
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:39,745
His followers gave away
all their possessions

457
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:41,815
and showed up in a field.

458
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,457
Guess who didn't show.

459
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,832
So the preacher said
that he miscalculated,

460
00:25:45,957 --> 00:25:48,729
and they went right back the next month
but with more followers.

461
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:51,039
Every time he was
irrefutably proved wrong,

462
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:52,800
it redoubled everyone's belief.

463
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:56,241
I know I sound just like them.

464
00:25:57,616 --> 00:26:00,128
But I also know you're wrong.

465
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,465
Something terrible's
gonna happen to me.

466
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:19,778
You trying to prove
to her she's not dying?

467
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:22,366
That would be dumb,
as she might be dying.

468
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:23,974
This woman lost her kid.

469
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:26,718
Why are you attacking beliefs
that give her a little bit of comfort?

470
00:26:26,843 --> 00:26:29,049
I don't care if her superstitions
make her feel better.

471
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:31,218
I just want her
to think more clearly.

472
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:34,050
Maybe that could make
her as happy as you are.

473
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,484
Where are we going?

474
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:40,952
Experimenting.

475
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:46,562
Stop it, Dr. Wilson.
It's just not cute anymore.

476
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,573
You already experimented
on the coma guy.

477
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:54,047
- Haven't you proved your point?
- Not to the patient.

478
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:56,247
And not to the millions
of idiots who drooled

479
00:26:56,372 --> 00:26:58,088
over that news item
about the magic cat.

480
00:26:58,213 --> 00:26:59,810
Why are you so obsessed with this?

481
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:02,286
Can't you just call her an idiot
and leave everyone alone?

482
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,743
Hey, look, kids, therapy cat.

483
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:05,831
You're a liar.

484
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,613
Therapy animals are dogs, not cats.

485
00:27:08,884 --> 00:27:11,334
Aren't you feisty?
This one's special.

486
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,587
If she likes you,
interesting stuff happens.

487
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,972
Kids, playtime's over.

488
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,575
This is a good thing.

489
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,086
Because either you're starting to doubt
yourself which is healthy, or...

490
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:31,565
I don't believe in the legend
of good-bye kitty.

491
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,360
Or you're starting to give
a crap what other people think,

492
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,110
which is just another way of saying you
give a crap about other people.

493
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:40,283
I'd love to hear more of your theory,
but I don't give a crap.

494
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:43,438
Also the pillcam's back.

495
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:47,331
Polypoid.

496
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,786
- Raised edges.
- Raised edges are actually necessary,

497
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:52,783
since that's the opening
to the appendix.

498
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,013
How many times are we gonna watch this?
There's no tumor.

499
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:59,635
Oh, my God.
The death cat is attacking your legs.

500
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,261
You're gonna die.

501
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:04,348
Maybe it has something
to do with that little red dot

502
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,070
dancing around down there.

503
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:09,025
Oh, my God, the death laser
is attacking your legs.

504
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,015
- You're gonna die.
- We're wasting time looking for cancer.

505
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,425
She's still walking around.
She's still pretty healthy.

506
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,220
Maybe it's something minor.

507
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:17,986
Maybe we're not wasting time.

508
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:21,119
We wouldn't have seen a flat lesion.

509
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:24,696
Skin cancer could have
metastasized to the intestines.

510
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:26,036
Cool.

511
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:28,629
Check for melanomas.

512
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,942
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

513
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,094
Come here.

514
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,817
Here, kitty.

515
00:29:07,636 --> 00:29:09,079
- What?
- It's not cancer.

516
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:12,625
We found spider veins on her back.
They weren't there when she came in.

517
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,747
Spider veins means Cushing's.

518
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:17,356
Could cause
an abdominal disturbance,

519
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:19,900
- brown urine...
- But the bronchospasm?

520
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,419
Cushing's myopathy.

521
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,420
It's uncommon but...

522
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,033
wait a second.

523
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:32,691
You didn't wake me up to tell me
a symptom that's not killing her.

524
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:34,416
What else is going on?

525
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:35,856
I think she's dying.

526
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:38,490
I just told you it's Cushing's.
Treat...

527
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:40,559
I don't mean
because of the spider veins.

528
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:41,904
Mr. Limpert died.

529
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:45,349
- If that's my gym teacher...
- it's your coma patient.

530
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:48,327
He was stable for a year and a half,
and he just died.

531
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:50,764
The cat was right, House.

532
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:57,336
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss.

533
00:29:57,506 --> 00:30:00,339
Say "puss" one more time.
It's the 6th "puss" that really does it.

534
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:03,957
You're right.
Sulking will solve everything.

535
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,172
That cat sat on my lap,
and that cat knows something.

536
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:09,781
- You believe it now?
- Yesterday it was all a coincidence.

537
00:30:09,906 --> 00:30:11,206
Yesterday it was

538
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:13,294
until I unintentionally
proved it wasn't.

539
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:14,909
Patient must have cushing's.

540
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:17,911
- We have to figure out whether it's...
- Cat's nose is powerful.

541
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:20,415
- It can smell liver or kidney failure.
- Exactly,

542
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,779
except if you'd glanced at the nursing
home files I had faxed this morning,

543
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:26,462
you'd know that most of the patients'
livers and kidneys were fine.

544
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:28,928
- What else?
- MRIS aren't telling if the cushing's

545
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:31,680
- in her adrenals or her brain.
- So check her A.C.T.H.

546
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:35,040
- A cat's vision is at the blue end...
- A.c.t.h. Is 11.7.

547
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,315
It's too close to tell.
We can't treat the wrong organ

548
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,907
'cause that won't solve anything.

549
00:30:39,032 --> 00:30:40,992
She could have a cortisol storm,
could kill her.

550
00:30:41,117 --> 00:30:43,402
Maybe as the senior fellow
you could have made sure

551
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:46,177
that my doors were closed, so that
I could be concentrating on the cat

552
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,445
instead of looking for the cat.

553
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:51,774
You all right?

554
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:54,894
Your nose.

555
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:04,552
What'd he say?

556
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:08,407
Sounds like he said,
"Do you like cranberry juice?"

557
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,534
Crap.

558
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:12,153
Cheaper than fake blood.

559
00:31:12,527 --> 00:31:14,025
And more cran-tastic.

560
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,475
Don't ever leave my door
open like that again.

561
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,205
You're playing pranks,
and this woman could be dying.

562
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,139
So have Chase do a venous sampling
in her brain.

563
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:25,633
If he finds something, it's there.
If he finds nothing, it's the adrenals.

564
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,566
I'm not who I used to be.

565
00:31:34,202 --> 00:31:35,252
I'm scared.

566
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:37,602
That's not a way to live.

567
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,066
I want to come work for you.

568
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:45,999
Jeez, Chris, you didn't think...

569
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:49,089
I didn't mean to imply
that I could hire you right now.

570
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:52,848
- You said you needed guys like me.
- I know,

571
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:55,038
but you don't have an MBA.

572
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,193
And I just hired
a chief medical officer.

573
00:31:57,318 --> 00:31:59,643
Let me invest
in that laser scalpel start-up.

574
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:03,152
- I got money saved. Not a ton but...
- We put in a $2 million minimum

575
00:32:03,277 --> 00:32:04,993
for the first round financing.

576
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,286
Look,

577
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:12,827
I guess I could take you on
at a smaller number.

578
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:16,433
But you have to understand,
it wouldn't be some quick payoff.

579
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,531
I know, I know it's not gonna change
my life overnight.

580
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:20,937
I just

581
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:23,203
need to start changing it.

582
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:26,819
Okay, then let's start.

583
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:35,024
What exactly are you hoping to find
inside your dead coma guy?

584
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:36,912
Catnip.
Chew toy.

585
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:39,423
I don't know.
That's why I'm looking.

586
00:32:40,104 --> 00:32:43,001
Your patient had cardiac arrest
during the venous sampling.

587
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:45,545
We got her back,
but her heart's still tenuous.

588
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:48,319
- That tell us anything?
- She's weak, possibly dying.

589
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,347
So nothing.
What about the A.C.T.H. ?

590
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:52,553
Slightly elevated.

591
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,344
That confirms the Cushing's
is in the brain... go.

592
00:32:55,469 --> 00:32:57,384
Are you sure that it's Cushing's?

593
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,192
You'd expect central body obesity.

594
00:32:59,317 --> 00:33:01,486
- She's in good shape.
- If it had a normal presentation,

595
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,861
- there wouldn't be a cat involved.
- So it's the brain.

596
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:06,817
The next question is whether to remove
the pituitary right now...

597
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,485
That's not a question for me.

598
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:10,701
That's a question for the patient.

599
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:13,174
You'll present both sides
and let her decide.

600
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:14,299
All right.

601
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,123
I've gotta stop telling you my theories.
You always just try to prove me wrong.

602
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:24,168
You mean the theory about Cuddy's ass
getting bigger at the full moon?

603
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,061
I confirmed that one.
Photo's on my blog.

604
00:33:27,186 --> 00:33:29,915
Normally, you'd be up in the patient
room hectoring her on what to do.

605
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,300
Instead you're up

606
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:35,220
in some irrelevant dead guy who may or
may not be connected to a magic cat

607
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,190
because you want to prove
to me that you don't care.

608
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:39,465
Case is over.

609
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,518
I'm exploring a scientific mystery.

610
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:46,000
I put up with your obsessions.
I even encourage them, for one reason...

611
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,425
they save lives.

612
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:50,901
I don't know what you're doing now.

613
00:33:58,321 --> 00:34:01,750
Cushing's means you're overproducing
a hormone called cortisol.

614
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,792
The recommended course of action
is to suppress it with drugs.

615
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:06,835
And that will cure it?

616
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,700
Just treat it.

617
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:10,497
It could come back.

618
00:34:10,904 --> 00:34:12,383
The only permanent solution

619
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,565
is to cut into your brain
and remove your pituitary gland,

620
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,590
but the surgery's dangerous.

621
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:20,177
Your heart stopped on the table
once already.

622
00:34:21,815 --> 00:34:23,102
I want the surgery.

623
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:27,272
This thing is gonna kill me
if I don't kill it first.

624
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,235
Because of the cat?

625
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:35,839
Do you want to tell me
what an idiot I'm being?

626
00:34:38,638 --> 00:34:42,345
I really believe that there are things
that science can't understand,

627
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,871
that there is a role
for faith and prayer,

628
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,946
but it's in the waiting room,

629
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:50,117
not the O.R.

630
00:34:54,568 --> 00:34:56,468
There's a reason I got sick.

631
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:00,264
There's a reason for all the bad things
that have happened to me.

632
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:05,267
I don't know what that reason is,
but I know that if there isn't one,

633
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,204
if there's no greater
purpose in the world,

634
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,202
then it's not a world
I want to live in.

635
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:18,221
I'll schedule an operating room.

636
00:35:40,364 --> 00:35:41,364
Early.

637
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:44,969
I'm not staying long.
I'm quitting.

638
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:50,182
You got a new job?

639
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,735
Well, then you're not quitting.
See you back here tomorrow.

640
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,697
You're not accepting my resignation?

641
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:01,740
Easier this way. It voids
the whole thing where you panic,

642
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:05,212
run back and grovel,
and I punish you and then take you back.

643
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,126
Bye.

644
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:14,914
Bring donuts.

645
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:16,840
Everyone loves those bear claws.

646
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:58,215
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss.

647
00:36:58,999 --> 00:36:59,999
Puss?

648
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,599
I've been waiting 15 minutes.
Where's Neil?

649
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:50,434
Neil doesn't work here anymore.

650
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,938
- He's the CEO.
- I'm sorry. I wish I could help you.

651
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,108
Sorry.

652
00:37:56,978 --> 00:37:59,704
This is crazy.
I'm investing with his company.

653
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:01,528
He doesn't have a company.

654
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:04,907
He worked here,
but he was a receptionist, a temp.

655
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,772
Where is he?
He's in custody.

656
00:38:06,897 --> 00:38:09,115
I really am not supposed
to say anything else.

657
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,662
I went to high school with him.

658
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,248
That's what everyone else
thought too.

659
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:16,501
I'm guessing you also
cured his ear problem.

660
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:19,338
Did you give him the money yet?

661
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:33,846
I was right.

662
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,746
And more satisfyingly,
you were wrong.

663
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:39,136
It was a coincidence.

664
00:38:39,261 --> 00:38:41,511
The cat was not predicting deaths.

665
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,426
It was trying to keep warm.

666
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:46,109
Yes, dead people are renowned
for their warm glow.

667
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:48,309
They are if they're feverish,

668
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:50,306
like three of the patients were.

669
00:38:50,431 --> 00:38:53,080
Or if they're wasting away,
like the other eight.

670
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:55,248
- Wasting doesn't...
- It does.

671
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:58,228
If it means someone sticks
a heating blanket on you.

672
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:03,483
Congrats. Because of your crazy
obsession with this cat,

673
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,383
you've solved
a completely trivial mystery.

674
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:06,984
Completely trivial?

675
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:08,997
My God.

676
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:11,736
It's clearly only partially trivial.

677
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:15,442
Debbie climbed on Morgan too,
which means she was overheated.

678
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:18,438
So what causes flushing and
mimics every cushing's symptom

679
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:20,953
except central body obesity?

680
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:24,064
Cancer.

681
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:27,635
A corticotropin-producing
carcinoid tumor of the intestine.

682
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,163
But your pillcam
didn't find anything.

683
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:33,453
Means it must be somewhere
the pillcam couldn't go.

684
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:35,789
The appendix.

685
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:38,750
Congratulations,
you probably saved her life.

686
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,579
You definitely saved
her needless surgery.

687
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:44,535
Yes, I did.

688
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:47,592
What's the O.R. Extension number?

689
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:49,197
Just curious.

690
00:39:59,156 --> 00:39:59,980
Thank you.

691
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,556
I wouldn't come here for thanks.
That would be ungracious.

692
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:08,808
It's more about gloating.

693
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:12,444
You were about to cut out
a piece of your brain

694
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,641
just to chase
some crazy superstition.

695
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:19,952
- But I didn't.
- You "didn't" didn't do anything.

696
00:40:20,077 --> 00:40:21,227
I stopped it.

697
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:24,356
And what made you do that?

698
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:26,823
Science, logic, reason.

699
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,383
Pick any three.

700
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:32,422
A cat chooses that exact moment
to sit on your computer.

701
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:37,098
Maybe that's science and logic
and reason or maybe it's something else.

702
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:42,691
You're an idiot.

703
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:48,446
I looked up the preacher
from New York state.

704
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,407
His followers never faded out.

705
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:54,908
They became
the seventh-day adventists,

706
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,546
a major religion.

707
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:58,413
That man changed
the course of history.

708
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,875
Because his followers
were as deluded as he was.

709
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:07,714
Maybe he just gave them
something to live for.

710
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,141
Feel better.

711
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,307
Cat pee on my chair?

712
00:41:59,905 --> 00:42:02,018
- Blood on my face?
- Fake blood.

713
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:08,799
You pay for the dry cleaning.

714
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:18,141
Why are you still alive?

715
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,442
I'm not sure.

716
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:21,611
I guess he was impressed
you stood up to him.

717
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:24,119
And got a cat to pee on his chair.

718
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:26,658
A cat.

719
00:42:37,844 --> 00:42:39,077
See you tomorrow.

720
00:43:12,398 --> 00:43:15,577
