1
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:13,733
Am I gonna have to give a speech?

2
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:17,079
- You're the publisher. Can't you do it?
- I can warm them up.

3
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:19,602
But you are gonna have to get over
this fear of public speaking

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,187
before the book tour.

5
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:23,689
Everybody.

6
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:26,150
Can I have your attention?
Thank you.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,066
Tim has a few words to say.

8
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:31,026
There you go, Tim.
They're warmed up.

9
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,121
Well,

10
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:37,703
what do you say at a time like this?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,126
Seriously, what do you say?

12
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:42,501
You could thank people for coming.

13
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:44,515
Thank you, Nick.

14
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:47,254
Actually, I'm always thanking Nick,

15
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,341
A man not only famous
for his ruthless editor's pen,

16
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,361
but his patient hand-holding
of crazy authors.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,551
You'd think that after three novels,

18
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:57,959
I'd start to develop
a little confidence, but...

19
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:01,167
for a book like this,
we are happy to supply the confidence.

20
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:02,624
Best-seller.

21
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:05,977
That's not gonna happen.

22
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:07,086
What?

23
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:09,068
Come on.
Short stories don't make money.

24
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,332
Short stories weren't making
money back in 1908.

25
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:14,198
You'd'have to be illiterate
to think they'd do as well as a novel.

26
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:16,826
Okay, Nick, let's step away
from the champagne

27
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:18,794
before somebody gets hurt.

28
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,997
You slaved over this book
right next to me.

29
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,217
Why would Northrop even publish
if it's only going to tank.

30
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:28,253
Have you failed to notice
you're our star author?

31
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:30,655
Obviously, Elaine wouldn't want
to offend you.

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,780
Honey.

33
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:37,355
I... I'm sorry.

34
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:39,974
I don't... I don't know
why I said that.

35
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,096
He's joking.

36
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,738
Nick knows as well as anyone
what you have done is art.

37
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,582
Is folding paper into animal shapes,

38
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:47,440
you don't expect
to make a living off it.

39
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,772
- What is wrong with you?
- You think someone who goes

40
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:53,053
through 10 assistants a year and doesn't
return her own children's phone calls

41
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:55,573
would give a damn about the state
of the American short story?

42
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,991
Please, be quiet.

43
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:04,241
I think something's wrong.

44
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:07,036
That title was a mistake too.

45
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,636
People are gonna compare you
to Salinger,

46
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:12,811
and, boy, are you gonna come up
short on that one.

47
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,650
Honey!

48
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:22,457
Call 911.
Help! We need help!

49
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:28,481
House - Season 05 Episode 17
"The Social Contract" (v. 0.90)

50
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:35,444
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak

51
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:53,881
The HTeam's AnonymHouse

52
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:58,894
Cameron brought this up
from the E.R.

53
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,355
Doesn't look
like a friendship bracelet.

54
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,993
It's Phineas Gage.

55
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,017
The most famous case study
in medical history.

56
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:08,537
 This patient got a railroad spike
drilled through his frontal lobe?

57
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:11,190
No. No trauma, but he does
have frontal lobe disinhibition.

58
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:12,860
Just like Gage.

59
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,796
Gage was a different person
after the spike.

60
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,153
Argumentative. Impulsive.

61
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,240
Whereas our guy became
a different person after chardonnay.

62
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,199
He was sober
when they brought him in.

63
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:23,361
There's also the nosebleed,
the collapse.

64
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,024
- MRI show anything?
- Nothing.

65
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:27,373
Good.
What fun would that be?

66
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,291
The tumor's not
in the cool neighborhood.

67
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:30,953
It's cool neighborhood adjacent.

68
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,462
A well-placed tumor in the nasal cavity
eroding into the brain

69
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:36,175
- could do the damage.
- Go stick a scope up Phineas's nose.

70
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,833
See what you find.

71
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:47,726
Daddy, I'm always gonna win if you keep
telling me what your cards are.

72
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:50,646
Well, then suppose
I tell you... while I tickle you.

73
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,907
Mr. Greenwald, I'm Dr. Taub.
This is Dr. Kutner.

74
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:56,467
We're here for another test.
Sorry about that.

75
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:58,368
You don't look sorry.

76
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,739
No offense.

77
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:03,784
- Although you do look kind of cheerful.
- It's a little creepy.

78
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:06,078
Should I want doctor who's
excited about how sick I am?

79
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:08,532
- I'm not...
- We're going to put this up your nose,

80
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:10,171
scan for any problems.

81
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:13,127
I can assure you that we are
completely unexcited about that.

82
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:15,112
Excuse me, sweetie.

83
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,851
She has an auditory
processing disability.

84
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:20,457
Marika-beleeka,
you have to get off the bed.

85
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:24,471
This might be
slightly uncomfortable.

86
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,669
Honey, do you mind if I step out?

87
00:04:26,794 --> 00:04:29,935
I've to make sure the final arrangements
are in place for the breast cancer walk.

88
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:33,022
Yeah, you do that. I'll pretend
to be macho while a guy stuffs

89
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,982
three feet of plastic up my nose.

90
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,907
It's too bad it's not your nose.

91
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,987
Lots more room to maneuver.

92
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,157
I guess the walk
can wait ten minutes.

93
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,326
Or in a sensible world, even longer.

94
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,174
Just how does tying up traffic
for six hours stop breast cancer?

95
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:50,129
You know how it works.
People donate...

96
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:53,542
Why not spend six hours building
houses for Habitat for Humanity?

97
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:56,170
Or is it wrong to help
two groups of people at once?

98
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,006
I bet there are those who have
breast cancer and no home.

99
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,717
It's my job, Nick.

100
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,344
- You walked yourself last year.
- To be supportive.

101
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,449
And because I knew you wouldn't
have sex with me if I didn't.

102
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,184
I'm gonna make my call.

103
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,060
Make this go away.

104
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:18,054
God, that honker really is huge,
isn't it?

105
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:23,074
Wednesday night.

106
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,800
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie
versus the Incinerator.

107
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:27,001
I can't.

108
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:30,078
Let me rephrase.
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie.

109
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,300
I understand monster truck code.

110
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:33,795
Do you understand "can't"?

111
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,620
Not when it follows
"Low-Down-Blue-Meanie."

112
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,088
Is the world coming to an end
Tuesday night?

113
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,065
- Otherwise, Wednesday...
- All right,

114
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,479
it's not "can't."
It's "don't want to."

115
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,237
The fact is I just don't like
monster trucks.

116
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:52,183
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

117
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:54,025
You've always liked monster trucks.

118
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,200
No, you've always liked them.
I've tolerated them.

119
00:05:57,947 --> 00:05:59,341
Seriously, I can only watch

120
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:02,387
so many hyped-up dune buggies
crush so many motor homes

121
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:04,768
without feeling the urge
to go see "La Boheme".

122
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,443
And I hate opera too.

123
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:09,073
What are you hiding?

124
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:10,447
I'm not hiding it.

125
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:13,693
I'm saying it loud and proud.
Death to monster trucks.

126
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:15,343
No nasal cancer.

127
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,088
And no marriage either
if our patient keeps saying

128
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:21,151
everything that comes into his head
without regard for the consequences.

129
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,507
You always led me to believe
you were one of a kind.

130
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:26,010
Luckily, jerkiness is
a temporary condition for this guy.

131
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,415
No, it's not.

132
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,420
We may be able to fix
his impulse to say

133
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:32,408
his thoughts out loud, but he always
gonna be the guy who thinks them.

134
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:35,182
But he's also gonna be
the guy who doesn't say them.

135
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:37,855
If he spent his whole life constructing
this nice guy persona,

136
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,899
isn't that as much who
he really is as anything else?

137
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,277
You would argue that.
You're all persona.

138
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:46,404
I agree with Wilson.
This guy's a Harry Potter.

139
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,404
The sorting hat was going to put Harry
in Slytherin based on his nature.

140
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:52,286
He refused,
so he ended up in Gryffindor.

141
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,620
Through choice.

142
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,290
There's damage somewhere in his brain.
Find it.

143
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,711
Are you sure you understand?

144
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:03,162
No, I'm lying.
Except I can't.

145
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,264
You ask me questions.
While I talk,

146
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:09,845
you look at my brain activity to see
where it's screwed up.

147
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,344
Then you're gonna cut the
screwed up part out to test it.

148
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,359
It's depressing,
but it's not rocket science.

149
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:17,061
I think he understands.
I don't mean to be abrasive.

150
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:20,553
Especially since you're such
a pleasure to imagine naked.

151
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:22,356
- Again, sorry.
- It's okay.

152
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:24,359
Thank you for understanding.

153
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:26,055
I'd do you, though.

154
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:29,473
- Really, my apologies. This stuff...
- It's okay.

155
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:31,386
House paged.

156
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:34,453
I would do her in a minute with fudge
and a cherry on top.

157
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:38,242
Would someone please explain
to this woman?

158
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:41,253
- There's only so many apologies...
- He has frontal lobe disinhibition.

159
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,705
I've already embarrassed
myself with one doctor,

160
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,090
whom I am at this moment
imagining with you

161
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,284
in a king-sized bed
with a mirror on the ceiling.

162
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,509
I'm so...

163
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:51,751
so sorry.

164
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:54,145
But if I couldn't have
both of you together,

165
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,240
you definitely would be
my first choice.

166
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:57,277
Where's House?

167
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:59,291
It's like trying not
to think of an elephant.

168
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:03,019
You're not an elephant. Your breasts,
in fact, are all Homo Sapiens...

169
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:04,480
House isn't here.

170
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:06,860
He wouldn't have paged me
if he couldn't

171
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,709
watch and enjoy the...

172
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:17,663
Your tush is like the pistons
in a Ferrari.

173
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:29,236
You're welcome.

174
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:30,986
That was for my benefit.

175
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,891
- You're 40 years old...
- 38.

176
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:35,147
- The administrator of a hospital...
- Dean of Medicine.

177
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:37,045
People don't get personal with you.

178
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,060
Except for me, and you dismiss me
as a jerk who's jerking you around.

179
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:42,104
But that guy can only tell
the truth.

180
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,523
He prefers your body to that
of a smokin' young hottie.

181
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:48,360
So that was your way
of saying I look good today.

182
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:52,092
You didn't get
the slightest kick out of that?

183
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,658
Don't be ridiculous, House.

184
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,040
I hope you know
your pistons are second to none.

185
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:06,295
I'm okay. I'm not jealous
of Cuddy's pistons.

186
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,235
Starting baseline activation.

187
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,048
You sure?
You looked upset.

188
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:13,844
- What he was saying was obnoxious.
- You've never been called attractive?

189
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:17,222
- He didn't call me attractive.
- He cast me in his mental porno.

190
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:20,475
That's what attractive means.
"I'm attracted to you, sexually."

191
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:23,979
Attracted can also mean "I'm attracted
to the whole package. To who you are."

192
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,311
Slight elevation at transaxial 60.

193
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:28,529
It could.

194
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:31,091
It never does. It's what women
choose to hear, not what men say.

195
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:33,996
Actually, it's exactly what men say
if they have any brains.

196
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:36,845
We have enough for a baseline.
What can we ask him that's indiscreet,

197
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,884
but that he won't hate us
for knowing?

198
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:42,235
Nick, do you vote
the same way as your wife?

199
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,578
God, no.

200
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:45,712
Good. He's spiking at 30.

201
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:49,087
She believes I voted for Hillary Clinton
in the primary and Obama in the general.

202
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,383
You're thinking I'm secretly
a Republican, right?

203
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,423
Wrong.

204
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:55,127
I secretly don't vote.
Ever.

205
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:59,139
Wait, you're 46,
and you've never voted?

206
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,643
Your voice is no longer attractive to me
with that note of disapproval.

207
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,645
Although I'm sure that will pass.

208
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,784
Look at that.

209
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,613
There's a spot in the Cingulate
Gyrus that's not lighting up.

210
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:10,377
One vote makes a difference?

211
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:12,361
- Not mathematic...
- We've got what we need.

212
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:14,696
We can't biopsy that.
It's too close to the brainstem.

213
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:17,241
Could be neurosarcoidosis.
At least it's treatable.

214
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,737
We give him steroids,
if we're right, we should start seeing

215
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:22,057
his symptoms improve
within half a day.

216
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,388
What are you looking at?

217
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:29,490
I find your strong attachment

218
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,672
to a working democracy
to be extremely sexy.

219
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:33,872
Ooh, you smooth talker.

220
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,619
Do you think my nose is too big?

221
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:41,690
Relax, he also implied my
bedside manner was a little off.

222
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,725
You don't agree with that, right?

223
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,851
No.

224
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,499
No one's ever mentioned
your nose before?

225
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,483
- You're a plastic surgeon.
- They tell me it suits my face.

226
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:52,795
- It does.
- Maybe.

227
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,728
Maybe that's just
the social contract.

228
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:57,781
You tell me I look great,
I tell you you're a people person.

229
00:10:58,064 --> 00:11:01,110
- How can you know the truth?
- You could ask for the truth.

230
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,912
What do you think of my nose?
Please tell me the truth.

231
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,372
It's fine. It's a nose.

232
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,600
Just proving a point.

233
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,675
Anyone sitting here?

234
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,052
Just my persona.

235
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,700
You know, it's amazing the
way people cling onto insults.

236
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:27,172
Or what they think are insults.

237
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:29,603
So that wasn't an insult?

238
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:32,422
I'm not suggesting
that, like our patient,

239
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:34,769
you hidding a dark sarcastic core.

240
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,195
Beneath a candy shell
of compulsive niceness.

241
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,937
I'm not always nice.
I'm not nice to you.

242
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:41,688
Because you know nice bores me.

243
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:43,213
Hence, still nice.

244
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,121
No, I'm suggesting
that you have no core.

245
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:49,333
You're what whoever you're with
needs you to be.

246
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:52,655
Okay, I guess
that could be insulting.

247
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,379
The interesting question is why.

248
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,591
Why do you think the world will end
in chaos and destruction

249
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,134
if you're not there to save it?

250
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,694
Because when my parents
put me in the rocket

251
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,023
and sent me here, they said,
"James, you will grow

252
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:05,596
to manhood under yellow sun."

253
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,559
Why'd you lie about monster trucks?

254
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:08,976
I didn't.

255
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:11,128
I checked your appointment book.

256
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:14,358
You got tomorrow night marked off, but
you didn't put down what you were doing.

257
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,984
You thought someone might look...

258
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:19,571
I'm playing racquetball
tomorrow night with Taub.

259
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:23,737
- Why would you hide that?
- Because the world revolves around you.

260
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:25,273
I devote time to anyone else,

261
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:27,662
you'd end up stalking me
and harassing them.

262
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:29,748
You say that
as though it wouldn't be fun.

263
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,866
And maybe I didn't want
to rub your nose

264
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:34,771
in the fact that we'd be doing
something you can no longer do.

265
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,772
Because I'm nice.

266
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,475
I thought you said the
steroids were gonna help him.

267
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:48,103
What... is it his heart?

268
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:50,901
EKG says heart's fine.

269
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:53,897
It's gotta be the kidneys.
I need to get him on dialysis.

270
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,738
He's on dialysis, and he's stable.

271
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,740
We know it's not systemic sclerosis.

272
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,460
Cyrano de Berkowitz.

273
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:09,623
Let it go.

274
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,084
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
could explain brain and kidney problems.

275
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:16,811
The CBC showed
normal white blood cells.

276
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:20,465
So how long have you been
playing racquetball with Wilson?

277
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,181
Four, five times.

278
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:26,256
- Could be diabetes.
- Or a congenital metabolic disorder.

279
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:29,531
Congenital disorders generally
don't wait till you're 46 to manifest.

280
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,333
So he's a late bloomer.

281
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,272
His daughter has
a neurological condition.

282
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,648
First of all, Wilson played tennis
on his college team,

283
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:38,909
and you are a Jew.

284
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:41,541
You're not athletic.

285
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,744
Run to the end of the hall and back.
I'll time you.

286
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:46,637
Sandy Koufax is Jewish. Greatest
left-handed pitcher of all time.

287
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:49,071
Sandy Koufax is all you Jews
go on about.

288
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:52,687
Sandy Koufax and the holocaust.

289
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:53,665
Gets old.

290
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:56,967
There are dozens of congenital
conditions that fit our parameters.

291
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:59,463
We can't spend time gene testing
for all of 'em, especially

292
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,333
when we're only guessing
it's congenital.

293
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,675
Is a z-shot offensive or defensive?

294
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:05,058
It's both.

295
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,464
You suspected
that was a trick question.

296
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,431
But I could have said neither.

297
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,333
Diabetes makes more sense.

298
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:14,519
We can narrow the testing down
to 40 likely candidates.

299
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:17,035
- Test for peripheral nerve damage.
- He's got brain damage.

300
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,779
He's likely to have peripheral
nerve damage no matter what the cause.

301
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,820
That's why we should not
test him for it.

302
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,345
Test the daughter.

303
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,303
Kutner runs the nerve test.

304
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:27,339
Taub, you might be right
about the diabetes.

305
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:30,768
Take supper away from our patient
and run a glucose tolerance test.

306
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,073
Oh, and the nurses have been
working so hard.

307
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:35,959
You can do the blood draws yourself.

308
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,001
They have to be done
every couple hours.

309
00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:40,307
You're punishing me
because you're jealous.

310
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:43,136
- I'm spending time with your friend.
- That would be petty.

311
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:46,510
I'm punishing you because you've joined
my best friend in lying to me.

312
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,732
Let me know when you're ready
to confess everything.

313
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,066
These can become either hot or cold.

314
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:04,310
As soon as it starts to feel
uncomfortable, I want you to tell me.

315
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:08,620
- There's something wrong with me?
- No, they're testing you to help Daddy.

316
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:10,575
Yes, what you're doing
is very important.

317
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,959
It's like the better you do,

318
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:14,913
the better we know your dad is.

319
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:21,912
I'll start with heat.

320
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:29,664
I know it's not his fault.

321
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,168
I know what he says is involuntary,

322
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,474
but it doesn't help.

323
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,906
Inside, he's still the same man.

324
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:40,481
That's the problem.

325
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,718
Apparently he's been thinking
this stuff all along.

326
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:46,762
Whoever that "same man" is, it's not
the person I thought I was married to.

327
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,579
You okay?

328
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:54,426
She should be feeling
something by now.

329
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,622
What does that mean?
Is she sick too?

330
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,228
You're burned. Why didn't you tell me
it hurt?

331
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:05,785
I wanted to help Daddy.

332
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,516
You said the better I do,
the better Daddy has to be.

333
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:09,641
Sorry.

334
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:15,032
- I'm starving.
- Only way we can do the test.

335
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,802
Good thing it's you
and not Dr. Hadley.

336
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:20,076
Could you keep her away from me?

337
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:24,273
I have a rich imaginative life.
I'd rather not share it.

338
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,256
We all have thoughts.

339
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:28,817
I know we all have sexual thoughts.

340
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,447
We have ignoble thoughts.

341
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,066
I just don't want those
to be who I am to people,

342
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:35,178
- especially not to my wife.
- I understand.

343
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:37,787
I don't think it would be fair
to define me by my passing thoughts.

344
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:39,576
My real choices are my actions.

345
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,875
And I've never done anything
to hurt her. I've never cheated.

346
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:47,257
- You're kidding me. You've cheated?
- What?

347
00:16:49,894 --> 00:16:53,177
- Why would you say that?
- Because you look guilty as hell.

348
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:54,664
Are you serious?

349
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:58,168
- Of course you're serious.
- Yes, everyone knows.

350
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:00,593
God, they must think you're a creep.

351
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,796
They might not know.
They might be idiots.

352
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:05,774
I just say these things.

353
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:17,757
Why'd you page me here?

354
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:21,578
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition.

355
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:24,917
Seems to be dead.
Why'd you page me here?

356
00:17:25,757 --> 00:17:28,807
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition

357
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:31,287
while hitting this against the wall.

358
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:36,012
- This is the only place we can do both.
- I finished the last blood draw.

359
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:39,933
I expect the people who work for me
to rise to a challenge.

360
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:43,407
Unless they don't expect
to work for me.

361
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,123
Last blood draw was at 6:00 A.M.

362
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,925
Sugar levels never rose
above 120 all night.

363
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,673
So the glucose was normal.

364
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,042
Means you were wrong about diabetes.

365
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:20,223
I still think it's the endocrine system.
Maybe I just got the wrong gland.

366
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:24,292
So you're going for thyroid
instead of pancreas?

367
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:25,726
Makes sense.

368
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,778
Fine.

369
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:34,813
I'm not playing racquetball
with Wilson.

370
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:36,728
I was never playing racquetball
with Wilson.

371
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:39,110
I have never played racquetball
with Wilson.

372
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:44,230
I thought it would be helpful
if a department head owed me a favor.

373
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,998
But it's not worth this.

374
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:48,453
Not bad.

375
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,309
You put on a good show.

376
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:53,172
You studied up.
Wilson actually booked a court.

377
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:55,925
If you were really
a racquetball player,

378
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,258
you'd know that you were holding
a squash racket.

379
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,514
Tell Kutner to do
a thyroid re-uptake scan,

380
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,226
Then go grab a nap
in one of the on-call rooms.

381
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,631
We're taking you to do
a thyroid re-uptake scan.

382
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:11,550
- We think your...
- I'm not going anywhere

383
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:14,152
until you explain why my daughter
has a bandage on her hand.

384
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:16,029
You said you wanted
to run some test.

385
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:19,150
I'd known it would involve pain,
I'd have said, "hell, no."

386
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,407
It's a mild burn.

387
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:22,750
Since Marika has a neurological
disability like you,

388
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,163
- we needed to make sure...
- She has no disability.

389
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,624
Nick, you know about her problem
with auditory processing.

390
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:29,798
"Auditory processing"?

391
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:32,962
That's code for "I can't stand thinking
my daughter's not perfect."

392
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,100
The therapist said
Marika's test scores...

393
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,035
were indeterminate.

394
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,960
She doesn't have a disability.
She daydreams.

395
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,492
She gets below-average marks in school
because she's below average.

396
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:47,936
Every parent thinks their child
are above average.

397
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,654
Do you have any idea
what the word average means?

398
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:53,815
- Somebody has to be under it.
- Nick, shut up.

399
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:00,571
Honey...

400
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,701
I'm not saying you're stupid.

401
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,962
Your mother's not the sharpest
crayon in the box,

402
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:09,537
and she does great.

403
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:15,180
See, this is why I told
your mother to keep you at home.

404
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:17,173
Didn't want you here.

405
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,427
Marika, wait!

406
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:25,442
- Get her...
- You're burning up.

407
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:30,311
And your lungs are full of fluid.


408
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:34,190
I need 200 milligrams of furosemide
and two milligrams of morphine, stat.

409
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:39,028
- His temperature is 103.
- Infection.

410
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,327
- The steroids must have forced it.
- What kind It could be anything.

411
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:44,411
Staph Aureus,
tuberculosis, strongyloides...

412
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,118
Go back to Phineas, get a history.

413
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:48,174
We've got one.
He hasn't been out of the country.

414
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,445
- Get a detailed history.
- No one at home is sick.

415
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,270
No one at work is sick.
There's no sign of ticks or mosquitoes.

416
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,721
Get a more detailed history.
Ask him again.

417
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:58,533
And again until he remembers something.
Not you.

418
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:00,102
Kutner can do it.

419
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,260
You're gonna be busy.

420
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:11,187
I'm here to invite you to lunch.

421
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,146
Why?

422
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:18,720
I've been made.

423
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,404
House sent me back to you
as a double agent.

424
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:29,829
- Anything wrong?
- Eyes are a little red.

425
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:31,372
There's a shocker.

426
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,417
I haven't had a good night's sleep
since this thing started.

427
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,336
You should get some rest yourself.

428
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,355
That's a good idea.

429
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,633
This is going to take some time.
It'll be pretty exhaustive.

430
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,694
Are you afraid
of what you might say while I'm here?

431
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:48,264
Are you telling me there's something
worse than what I've already heard?

432
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:51,282
No, I don't know what I'm gonna say.

433
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,103
I don't know
how I'm gonna hurt you next.

434
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:57,231
I think we should be around each other
as little as possible right now.

435
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:03,821
This is pathetic.

436
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:05,127
I know.

437
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:09,397
Tell Marika I love her very much.

438
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:12,080
She understands that.

439
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,120
I don't think she does.

440
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:17,989
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

441
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:36,914
Guy leads a boring life.

442
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,343
They stay home a lot.

443
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:41,484
No travel, no exotic pets,
no nearby standing water.

444
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:43,987
You sound pleased about something.
Can we get to that part?

445
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,155
His wife rescues dogs.

446
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,208
Among others, a big Rottweiler
who's taken over the house.

447
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,308
- Our patient hates it.
- Was the wife there to hear is?

448
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:53,621
Too bad. Keep going.

449
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,553
The dog marks his territory
all over the living room.

450
00:22:56,678 --> 00:22:58,837
I asked what the odds were
that he would have put down

451
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,638
food or drink
where the dog could reach.

452
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,631
He said he put a glass on the floor
while he was fixing the television.

453
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,499
The dog was fixing the television?

454
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,168
- The patient's eyes red?
- I'm thinking Weil's.

455
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,723
Bacterial.
He lucked out.

456
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:14,475
Start him on doxycycline.

457
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,728
If he improves,
we'll know we were right.

458
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,984
I told Wilson you sent me
to get information.

459
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:23,592
And now you're telling me.

460
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,996
What does that make you,
a quadruple agent?

461
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,100
He let me print out his e-mails.

462
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:31,993
Excellent.
Information he wants us to have.

463
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:34,614
Did he let you print out
his deleted e-mails?

464
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:36,914
- Then go back there...
- As long as I was sitting there,

465
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:40,821
I thought I'd print 'em anyway.
Top one's the one you're looking for.

466
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,756
"Writing to confirm Wednesday
at 7:00 P.M."

467
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:48,602
It's outgoing
to jgonzalez@nymercy.net.

468
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,263
There's a Joan Gonzalez in oncology.
It's a consult.

469
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:55,516
Secret consult, 7:00 P.M.?

470
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,728
Joan is perky.

471
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:01,606
You're wrong. There was
a patient file attached.

472
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:04,024
- Where?
- It was password-protected.

473
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:08,910
Wilson doesn't password-protect
his patient files.

474
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:11,126
I'm the only one he'd expect
ever to look there,

475
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:13,986
and he knows there's only one
patient I'd want to check on.

476
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:16,652
You think Wilson's sick?

477
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:20,196
If Wilson had cancer,
there'd be no reason

478
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:22,168
for him to drive 3 hours
to Manhattan.

479
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,420
He could pull strings here
and get the best treatment.

480
00:24:24,545 --> 00:24:26,547
Six articles by Gonzalez.

481
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:30,051
"Managing suicidal thoughts
in oncology patients,"

482
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,880
"Suicidal ideation
in children with leukemia."

483
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,460
I don't want to ask this,

484
00:24:34,585 --> 00:24:37,850
but have you ever had reason
to think he might be depressed?

485
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:40,812
No.
Get out of here.

486
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:55,034
Your fever's down
and your lungs are clearing.

487
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:58,236
How long before
this brain thing goes away?

488
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:01,290
The infection's gone,
but the damage the infection did...

489
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:03,475
you'll have to live with.

490
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:07,504
You're telling me you can't fix this?
There's gotta be a way.

491
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:10,757
We'd need to remove the damaged area
in our Cingulate Gyrus,

492
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:14,144
- but it's too close to the brainstem.
- You can't risk it.

493
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:16,555
But I could shop around,

494
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,932
and maybe some better doctors
at a better hospital...

495
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,736
The brain stem controls
the body's involuntary systems.

496
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,646
The slightest mistake
could kill you.

497
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:27,942
Even if you survive, you may never
be able to breathe on your own again.

498
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:30,031
You may never...
- I get it.

499
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,655
I know this seems like a lot to deal
with right now.

500
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:36,617
But people have adapted to living
with all kinds of neurological deficits.

501
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:40,122
At least we can promise you
it won't get any worse.

502
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,192
Get the hell out of my room.

503
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:57,347
Your assistant said
that you were out of the hospital,

504
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,672
taking a walk.

505
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,924
Is there an emergency?

506
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,638
I don't know.
Is there?

507
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:05,712
You never take a walk
unless you've got something

508
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:08,002
- you need to think about.
- Maybe you just don't have

509
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:10,727
a good statistical sampling
of my walks.

510
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:13,320
The other thing you do
when you need to think

511
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,068
is you come to my office.

512
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:19,118
Apparently, this is something you can
only discuss with Gonzalez at NY Mercy.

513
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:28,293
Taub. Another graduate
of the House school of being a dick.

514
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:29,804
Private Dick.

515
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:33,382
I'd love to stay for the full
inquisition, but I need some hot coffee.

516
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:40,180
Of course you need hot coffee.

517
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,750
It's 45 degrees outside,
and you left your coat upstairs.

518
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:45,353
Why?

519
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,419
You're going to tell me
why I forgot my coat?

520
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:51,437
Once you get outside, the cold
would have reminded you.

521
00:26:51,562 --> 00:26:53,653
You could have come back,
but you didn't.

522
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,778
You chose to be uncomfortable.

523
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:59,158
Why would someone choose that?

524
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:03,038
Because they hate themselves?

525
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,516
Has it ever occurred to you
that when I don't share something,

526
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,375
it might not be meant
as a challenge?

527
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:08,667
It might just mean

528
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,104
that I'd like there to be
one molecule of my life

529
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,130
that goes unexamined
by Gregory House.

530
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,220
Nick Greenwald.
I hear you're the guy in charge.

531
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,859
I'm the patient
with the disinhibition.

532
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:37,946
If you're here to say thanks,
you're welcome.

533
00:27:38,152 --> 00:27:40,575
- Now go away.
- I'm not thankful. I'm pissed.

534
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:43,201
All the more reason to go away.

535
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:45,538
They're talking
about sending me home.

536
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,607
To what? A life where I'll continually
drive away anyone

537
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,671
who might for a second
care about me?

538
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,034
Those are the breaks.

539
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:00,208
You could operate.

540
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,130
You could die.

541
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,380
So I'm either better or dead?

542
00:28:07,537 --> 00:28:08,987
I'm okay with that.

543
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:16,539
I've always been kind of a...

544
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:18,438
an impatient guy.

545
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:22,004
But I've worked hard
to keep my mouth shut.

546
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,153
I've made my wife happy.

547
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:26,180
I've made my little girl happy.

548
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,766
I want that back.

549
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:32,515
Otherwise, it's no life.

550
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:43,763
I want you to remove
a small problem.

551
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,060
I'm not a neurosurgeon.

552
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,354
But your boss is.
You could assist.

553
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,966
I'm sure you'd like
to add to your resume.

554
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:56,566
It's too near the brain stem.

555
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,755
- Nobody's gonna touch it.
- Your boss would.

556
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,655
He's an egomaniac. I know
'cause I keep seeing him at the club.

557
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:04,407
He just needs a little push.

558
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:07,243
I'm sure by now you've kissed
his ass sufficiently.

559
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:13,096
Would you like me to phrase it
as "you're politically gifted"?

560
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:14,677
I can do that.

561
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,387
You want me to help you?

562
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,028
Tell me why.

563
00:29:23,284 --> 00:29:25,184
- Why what?
- Why you care.

564
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,985
The puzzle's solved.
The guy's alive.

565
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,227
The odds of coming out of this surgery
with that same status aren't that great.

566
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:34,613
My patient has
a quality of life issue.

567
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:38,056
He says awful things.
Hardly a medical condition.

568
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:42,946
When he leaves here,
he's going to lose his family.

569
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:45,353
He's gonna alienate
the people he works with.

570
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:47,015
And if he ever finds a friend

571
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,805
who's willing to put up
with his crap,

572
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,180
he'll be lucky.

573
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:54,362
Until he drives them away too.

574
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,796
I'll see what I can do.

575
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:29,869
You've apparently got
this whole coat thing backwards.

576
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:33,118
I may have overreacted.

577
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:35,833
You definitely overreacted.

578
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,211
- I knew you'd meet me halfway.
- It made me think.

579
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:41,872
You only snap on one subject:

580
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:43,382
losing people.

581
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,218
So I went back to the intel.

582
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:49,555
It's true there's only one doctor
named Gonzalez at New York Mercy,

583
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:53,517
but there's a Javier Gonzalez
who's a nurse in the psych ward.

584
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:57,062
And who could you lose
who'd end up there?

585
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:01,150
Maybe the reason I don't always open up
to you is because it's redundant.

586
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:02,869
Daniel wilson.

587
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:05,586
Once you got a name,

588
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:08,750
it's amazing how much stuff
you can learn on the phone.

589
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,978
I mean, if you're a doctor
and you lie freely.

590
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:13,940
They found your brother sleeping

591
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:16,457
in the lobby of an office building
in Manhattan.

592
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,429
Got aggressive
when they asked him to leave,

593
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:20,813
and the cops took him
to the Mercy psych ward.

594
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:23,631
There have been new anti-psychotics
developed since he ran away.

595
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,008
He's been on them for
a couple of days. And by tonight,

596
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,802
he should be in shape to talk to me.

597
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:30,763
But you're not sure if he wants to.

598
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,683
I'll be in New York in a few hours.

599
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,451
I guess I'll find out.

600
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,521
Why wouldn't you tell me this?

601
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:40,323
House, you and I...

602
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:44,401
We don't have
the normal social contract.

603
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:46,654
I don't expect you
to tell me the lies...

604
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,132
I am fully capable of lying to you.

605
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:50,658
I've lied plenty of times.

606
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:52,815
I mean, collaborative lies.

607
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:56,288
Giving someone a hand who maybe
needs to deceive themselves

608
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:57,942
just a little.

609
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:03,295
For two days I've been thinking about
how Danny's gonna react when he sees me.

610
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:06,034
If I said that to anybody else,
they'd say,

611
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:08,397
"don't worry.
It'll all be all right."

612
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:10,094
You wouldn't.

613
00:32:11,756 --> 00:32:13,722
Because it might
all go horribly wrong.

614
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:17,690
Yeah.

615
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,689
Yeah, it might.

616
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,605
In which case,

617
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:25,317
you might want some company.

618
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:34,477
Your heart's beating.
First hurdle past.

619
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,037
Now we need know
if you can breathe for yourself.

620
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:42,585
Oh, thank god.

621
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,214
Now, do you know who you are?

622
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,175
Nick Greenwald.

623
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:52,301
Former S.O.B.

624
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:55,012
Thank you.

625
00:32:56,836 --> 00:33:00,352
Now I can go back to my beautiful
life with my beautiful wife.

626
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,248
Maybe she'll stop whining
and cut me some slack

627
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:06,191
now that I've risked my life.

628
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,671
Doesn't make sense.
We removed the problem.

629
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:12,239
We removed the damage. Maybe
we were wrong about the problem.

630
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,366
I need to believe
we can get through this.

631
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,881
Temperature's 94.5.

632
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:18,245
Do you really think i'm stupid?

633
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:20,541
Honey, you're not stupid.

634
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,625
You'just...
Please don't do this.

635
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,835
- Could be the surgery.
- Do you respect me,

636
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,442
Nick, what do you think of
what I do for a living?

637
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:30,733
I think people who publicize
important things

638
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:33,882
are people who can't do
important things themselves.

639
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:35,095
Honey, stop.

640
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:37,319
- Don't.
- Do you regret marrying me?

641
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,683
- 94.2.
- Sometimes.

642
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,844
- Everybody wonders...
- Get me a heating blanket.

643
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:43,812
- Do you even love me?
- Yes.

644
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,106
I don't know why.

645
00:33:47,296 --> 00:33:48,025
Wait.

646
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,110
Let me...

647
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,112
V-tach. Get me the paddles.

648
00:33:58,091 --> 00:33:59,091
Clear.

649
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:04,632
Echo says his heart
is structurally fine.

650
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:07,294
But his temperature is still dropping.
He's headed for hypothermia.

651
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,755
I can't reach House.
It just goes to voicemail.

652
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,091
We were wrong about infection.
His temperature's going

653
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,506
up and down because something's
playing with his thermostat.

654
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:16,450
Which means the brain
damage is spreading.

655
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:19,515
What causes brain damage and nose bleed,
involves the lungs, heart and kidneys?

656
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,382
Cancer?
We could text him.

657
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:22,477
It's not cancer.

658
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,187
Normal psa, normal blood smear,
colonoscopy normal.

659
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,816
- Do a full body scan.
- House hates full body scans.

660
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,859
- House isn't here.
- House is right.

661
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,113
Everybody's got 3 or 4 meaningless
anomalies that'll come up on a scan.

662
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,191
Chasing each one will take time
we don't have.

663
00:34:36,316 --> 00:34:38,117
Feel free to send him an im.

664
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,194
You told me
you saw your brother once.

665
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:27,583
After he disappeared.

666
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:29,019
13 years ago.

667
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:31,586
I used to go to Princeton
whenever I could.

668
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:34,548
I must have hit every
homeless shelter in town.

669
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,639
And then one day,
I'm just sitting at this deli,

670
00:35:36,764 --> 00:35:38,640
having a sandwich,
I look out the window,

671
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:40,021
and there he is.

672
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,039
He was gone
by the time I got outside.

673
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,185
That's why you were so eager when
I told you there was a job at Princeton.

674
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,815
I thought it was just my charm.

675
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,024
That's the team.
Shouldn't you answer?

676
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,902
They already texted me to say
they're doing something stupid.

677
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:58,947
- There's a small abdominal aneurysm.
- Irrelevant.

678
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,408
- What else you got?
- Cyst in the pleura around the lungs.

679
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,790
Also irrelevant.
Couldn't cause any of the symptoms.

680
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:06,747
There's a density in the liver.
Could be vascular malformation.

681
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:10,012
If he's got multiple avms, screwed-up
blood flow would explain everything.

682
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:11,805
We can only spot
them with angiography.

683
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,572
We'll have to do targeted scans with
contrast and then embolize each one.

684
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:17,836
- Can we do that before he freezes?
- We'll find out.

685
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:22,721
The spell-correct on Kutner's phone
has got a hair trigger.

686
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:25,035
Either that, or the patient has

687
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,541
a cyclone in
the floral of his lungs.

688
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,075
You took a walk
in 45-degree weather,

689
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
and you left your coat behind.

690
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:38,904
Go ahead.

691
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:41,469
I think you were punishing yourself.

692
00:36:42,106 --> 00:36:46,110
I think you wanted to feel what it would
be like be homeless a New Jersey winter.

693
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:49,478
That tells me guilt.

694
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,459
That tells me something happened.

695
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:57,965
The schizophrenia started
when he was a teenager.

696
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,957
When he was in college.

697
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,051
He was on meds,

698
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:05,180
but he'd still think a professor was
out to get him because he got a b,

699
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,707
or he'd fight with his roommates
because he never showered.

700
00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:09,959
- Where were you?
- Med school.

701
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:14,267
He called me every day.

702
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:17,651
Talked for hours.
I didn't have hours.

703
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:19,400
Interesting.

704
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:23,407
Later for that.
Go on.

705
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,217
I was tired of being the guy
that everybody counted on,

706
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:28,995
so one night, Danny called...

707
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:32,951
One night, Danny called, crying,
upset about something.

708
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:36,295
I had to study for an exam.
So I...

709
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:38,041
I hung up...

710
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:39,664
Took my things.

711
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:42,092
Went to the library so I wouldn't
have to hear the phone ring.

712
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:44,177
I wonder how that turned out.

713
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:46,321
My mother called me the next day.

714
00:37:46,446 --> 00:37:48,646
Danny had run away
and left his meds behind.

715
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:50,492
Which I knew meant

716
00:37:50,617 --> 00:37:54,046
that he would never be able
to choose to come back,

717
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,334
because he'd be so detached
from reality.

718
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:02,195
So you made your one effort
to live a normal, selfish life

719
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,771
and the universe immediately
smacked you down.

720
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:08,365
And because we're wired to find
meaning in semi-random events,

721
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,537
you decided never
to be that careless again.

722
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,916
You don't think that's
a little facile?

723
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:16,251
Actually, I don't.

724
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,719
I think you did it consciously.

725
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:20,607
You developed your...

726
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,717
people-pleasing talents
the way an olympic athlete

727
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,844
develops his muscles.

728
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:28,138
Talk about an overreaction
to a single event.

729
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,265
It was a pretty big event.

730
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:32,017
Hanging up the phone?

731
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:34,060
That's what you're
blaming all this on.

732
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,230
That's the behavior you've been
trying to correct.

733
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,858
As though nothing else went wrong
in your brother'life.

734
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:43,041
Of course,
he overreacted too, but...

735
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:47,532
His glucose was normal.

736
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:51,781
We're not talking about
my brother anymore, are we?

737
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,250
It's House.

738
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,214
Adms don't explain his glucose.

739
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:03,382
Since this is significant moment
in my life and all...

740
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:04,591
Yeah.

741
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:07,052
- I think I'll just go in then.
- Explain that.

742
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:08,323
Right.

743
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:12,808
You'd given him steroids. His
glucose should have been elevated.

744
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,142
That wannabe cyst you found
in the whole body scan,

745
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:18,271
without the glucose,
it's an irrelevant cyst.

746
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,816
With the glucose,
it's a relevant fibroma.

747
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,693
He has doege-potter syndrome.

748
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,754
His fibroma is secreting
human growth hormone,

749
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,948
which acts like insulin,
lowering his glucose.

750
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:30,950
It doesn't explain the organ failure
or the brain damage.

751
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:33,612
This whole thing is an overreaction.

752
00:39:33,737 --> 00:39:35,576
That one small fibroma.

753
00:39:35,931 --> 00:39:39,167
It's benign, but his body's acting
like it's an invader.

754
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:41,296
His antibodies went
to war against it

755
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,672
and got carried away,
attack his other systems.

756
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,592
Take out the fibroma,

757
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:48,555
he'll be a happy hypocrite
again in no time.

758
00:39:56,174 --> 00:39:57,602
Maybe I should call a cab.

759
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:59,640
Your wife's probably just late.

760
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:00,793
Yeah.

761
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:04,833
I'm...

762
00:40:05,147 --> 00:40:06,736
sorry about...

763
00:40:07,445 --> 00:40:08,545
You know...

764
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,881
The things I said.

765
00:40:12,964 --> 00:40:14,807
I have a...

766
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:16,246
conspicuous nose.

767
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,998
It suits your face.

768
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,048
I'm sorry I'm late.

769
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,510
Traffic.

770
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:36,994
I have some good news.

771
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,110
I was gonna tell you,
and then you got sick.

772
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:41,435
It didn't seem like the best time.

773
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,376
I've been offered a better position.

774
00:40:44,923 --> 00:40:48,204
I'd be coordinating cancer
awareness walks in three cities.

775
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,863
That's great.

776
00:40:50,341 --> 00:40:51,740
Congratulations.

777
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:54,367
I know you've worked hard for this.

778
00:40:55,434 --> 00:40:56,434
Thank you.

779
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,108
Is Marika okay?

780
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm sure she's moved on.

781
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:13,206
Kids are so resilient.

782
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:34,553
You okay?

783
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,804
I'll be seeing Danny
again next week.

784
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:40,749
- I'd like you to meet him.
- Sure.

785
00:41:41,387 --> 00:41:42,916
He sounds interesting.

786
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:45,627
Go on.

787
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,922
I thought seeing him again
would change everything.

788
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:50,632
It would be wonderful or terrible.

789
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,212
Instead...

790
00:41:53,934 --> 00:41:55,137
We're just strangers.

791
00:41:56,131 --> 00:41:58,055
It's kind of anticlimactic.

792
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:01,108
Which is better than terrible.

793
00:42:06,814 --> 00:42:07,987
Go on.

794
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:10,242
Does it bother you...

795
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,595
that we have no social contract?

796
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,615
My whole life is one big compromise.

797
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,951
I tiptoe around everyone like
they're made of china.

798
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:21,288
I spend all my time analyzing: what
will the effect be if I say this?

799
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,106
Then there's you.
You're a reality junkie.

800
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:27,351
If I offered you a comforting lie,
you'd smack me over the head with it.

801
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:29,923
Let's not change that.

802
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:34,059
No, see, this...

803
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,476
If you were implementing
the social contract,

804
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:39,381
you'd say that,

805
00:42:39,506 --> 00:42:41,396
but only because...

806
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:43,551
It makes me feel better...

807
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:48,219
It is kind of fun
watching you torture yourself.

808
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,616
Do you think things will
work out with my brother?

809
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:52,741
No.

810
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:57,053
But when it does go wrong,
it won't be your fault.

811
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,560
Thanks, House.

812
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:03,192
You do actually like monster trucks.

813
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:04,483
Absolutely.
