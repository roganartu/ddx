1
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:22,146
This sucks.

2
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:25,154
This is why we need
to make a statement.

3
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:26,668
You know?

4
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:28,747
- I don't think that...
- What?

5
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:31,005
You afraid we'll end up
in detention?

6
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:33,906
Yeah, that's...
that's what teachers do.

7
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:37,641
They're not going to send
all of us to detention.

8
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,272
Mr. Henderson is totally lame,

9
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:41,675
this is our best chance
to inform him of that fact.

10
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,126
You don't think he's lame?

11
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:45,321
Well...

12
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:48,049
- Yeah, but...
- Then what's the problem?

13
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:51,925
Okay.

14
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,971
The Camden hills
local jazz ensemble.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,151
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

16
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,735
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

17
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:14,240
yuletide carols
being sung by a choir

18
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,410
and folks dressed up like eskimos

19
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,866
everybody knows

20
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:20,681
Mr. Henderson's a stupid...

21
00:01:26,557 --> 00:01:28,339
Why... why'd you do that?

22
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:39,271
I don't feel so...

23
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,378
So good.

24
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:57,116
House - Season 05 Episode 11
"Joy to the world"

25
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:04,267
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak

26
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:22,516
www.house-fr.com

27
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,353
16-year-old female

28
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:29,732
gets pranked, also gets
visual hallucinations and vomiting.

29
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:32,109
Turns out to be a failing liver.

30
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,154
Why have Foreman's breasts
suddenly started to droop?

31
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,823
Large breasts are a classic symptom
of you letting Foreman

32
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,232
take vacation days so
he can finish his F.D.A. Reports

33
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:42,995
- before the end of the year.
- When are you taking vacation?

34
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,013
Hepatic and neurological
involvement...

35
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:48,083
So I understand Foreman's absence.
Your presence, not so much.

36
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:50,611
I'm bringing in a case.
You have noticed me doing that before.

37
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,458
I've noticed you a lot recently.

38
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,299
It's almost as if you have
a sexual interest in someone here,

39
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:56,670
Like, say...

40
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:58,761
- Taub.
- Well,

41
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,804
Taub might think I like him

42
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,933
if I stayed, which is why
I'm gonna do this.

43
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:07,853
Somehow I don't think
that was really about me.

44
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:10,856
- Wilson's disease.
- Ceruloplasmin's normal.

45
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:12,942
You've got a christmas present.

46
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:16,654
"Greg, made me think of you."

47
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:27,337
That's funny.
Usually explodes after I do that.

48
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:28,457
Alcohol abuse?

49
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:29,803
She's 16.

50
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:33,212
The kind of boozing that destroys
your liver that early, parents

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,778
or teachers would notice.

52
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:38,342
Manual of the operations of surgery
by Joseph Bell.

53
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,386
- You're throwing that away?
- Twice.

54
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,571
- Someone's screwing with me. Forget it.
- Yeah,

55
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:46,327
gifting antique medical texts.

56
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:48,963
- Oldest gag in the book.
- Handwriting's kinda girly.

57
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:51,897
- You got an admirer?
- I said forget the book!

58
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:55,401
Why'd they pick on her?

59
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:56,941
She's an overachiever.

60
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,091
High grades. She volunteers.
She's a big target.

61
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:00,472
I'm assuming literally.

62
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:03,000
Depending on where this school falls
on the heathersscale.

63
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,662
You think the kids slipped her
something? Their teachers grilled them.

64
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,664
When do teachers ever know
how to motivate their students?

65
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,302
What did you do to Natalie?

66
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,917
It's all my fault.

67
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:14,409
I didn't stop her
from being a total pig.

68
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,396
- What are you...
- Your friend's liver is failing.

69
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,412
We're doing what we can,
but she still might need a transplant.

70
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:24,618
She could die unless you
tell us what you gave her.

71
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,777
- Just tell him.
- Shut up.

72
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:29,852
We gave her some'shrooms.

73
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,256
We took some ourselves, we just...

74
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,565
Wanted to make her
loosen up a little.

75
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,967
How thoughtful of you.

76
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,536
You got any left?

77
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:40,696
They're in Simon's locker.

78
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:43,699
- This was your idea?
- No way.

79
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:45,494
I didn't give her.

80
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,557
Right, you just knew about it
and let them do it.

81
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:49,747
Poisonous mushrooms
and hallucinogenic are different.

82
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:51,793
Not if they don't dry correctly.

83
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,874
Get back to school.
You better hope we got to her in time.

84
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,997
- What?
- Am I going to get in trouble?

85
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,059
Should we apologize or something?

86
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,544
Yes, you should.

87
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:14,192
Natalie's on the third floor.

88
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:16,267
- Who's down there?
- Mr. Robins

89
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,153
Where's the woman
I spoke to last week?

90
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,073
The trial patient,
with the advanced symptoms.

91
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,992
- She dropped out.
- Is she okay?

92
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,161
Not health-related.
She...

93
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,581
just wants to drop out.

94
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,539
- Why?
- She didn't say.

95
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:35,056
I only break into the houses
of very special patients

96
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:36,460
to understand them better.

97
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:43,031
I do good today, boss?

98
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:45,059
No rigidity, no cog wheeling.

99
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:46,804
Absolutely i'd call that good.

100
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,514
Great. Thanks.

101
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:53,166
- Your clipboard.
- Keep it.

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,784
This place actually smells of evil.

103
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,279
Where do you work, again?

104
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,895
Why would House throw out
a book worth hundreds of dollars?

105
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,549
To make you ask that question.

106
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:10,927
Can you really put a price tag
on screwing with people?

107
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:13,648
Can you get us into Natalie
soellner's locker while we're here?

108
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:16,718
House always has an agenda.

109
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,199
- Just screwing with us isn't...
- Yeah, he'd never do that.

110
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:20,754
Wait, he already did last year.

111
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,516
The secret santa gift
he got himself?

112
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:25,059
He was making us fight
over who could get him the best gift.

113
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,089
This time
he's just making us wonder.

114
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:30,055
No animosity, no ugly competition.

115
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,890
I think it's a real present.

116
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,245
If it's real, then House
really was freaked.

117
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:37,354
And if it affects him,
eventually it'll affect us.

118
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,692
Maybe it wasn't those kids
who poisoned Natalie.

119
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:43,796
Maybe it was Natalie herself.

120
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:49,003
I didn't try to kill myself.

121
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:51,151
Then why'd you have
all those painkillers?

122
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,192
In case I get a headache.

123
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:55,205
Maybe you took a few too many.

124
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,855
- Do you have any kids?
- No.

125
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:01,617
But high school

126
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:04,476
wasn't all that different
when I was your age.

127
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:06,592
Teenagers can be incredibly mean.

128
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,375
I know what you're going through.

129
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:11,852
I bet you were cool.

130
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:15,320
- You're pretty.
- You're pretty, too.

131
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,371
I'm fat.

132
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:19,536
I'm a loser.

133
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:21,777
They all hate me.

134
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:25,200
You know what they did last year?

135
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:28,655
They took these photos of me
for the yearbook...

136
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:30,711
But it wasn't.

137
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:33,757
It was for this website.
Making fun of me...

138
00:07:34,783 --> 00:07:35,954
Calling me a pig.

139
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:37,567
Forget about them.

140
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,027
Let's just make you better.

141
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,295
What's the point?

142
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,759
Acetylcysteine could save her liver.
But we have to act fast.

143
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,845
- If she took all those pills...
- There's no chance.

144
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,437
She was the happiest,
sweetest little girl

145
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:00,771
And a year ago she hits puberty,
and it's like this

146
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,024
secretive little stranger
moved into her room.

147
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,027
I try to talk to her about
what she's going through.

148
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:12,574
Give her the treatment.

149
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:15,509
- You can't really think that she...
- I don't know what to think.

150
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,587
If it's a subpoena,
he's gotten that kind of present before.

151
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:26,994
It was a book.

152
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:28,423
That narrows it down.

153
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:31,927
Just look for someone who knows
how to read or has been to a bookstore.

154
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:35,016
Most bookstores don't carry
Joseph Bell on surgery.

155
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:42,312
- Did it have a note?
- "Greg, made me think of you."

156
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,314
Green wrapping paper?

157
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,327
How did you know that?

158
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:51,337
What is it?

159
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:54,700
It's nothing.

160
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:59,151
Yes, when something's nothing,
the natural response is to guess

161
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:02,722
the color of the paper it's wrapped in
and then descend into stunned silence?

162
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,255
Irene adler.

163
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,146
Christmas, 2001.

164
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,283
Sarcoid symptoms, but

165
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,512
she didn't respond to methotrexate.

166
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,985
I've never seen him so obsessed.

167
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:23,100
He saved her with a last minute
Wegener's diagnosis, but

168
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:25,939
the hours he put in,
I thought it would kill him.

169
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:28,789
And then...

170
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,042
Well,

171
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,728
he fell for her.

172
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:36,366
But it was too soon
after Stacy and...

173
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:38,927
It sounds silly, but

174
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:40,558
Irene was

175
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,574
the one who got away.

176
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,011
Really?

177
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:49,630
No, you idiots.
House is just screwing with you.

178
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,841
You think there's some woman
with a mysterious green

179
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,366
- wrapping paper trademark?
- Then how did you guess...

180
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:55,795
I could be wrong.

181
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,510
It's possible a secret admirer
gave House the same book

182
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:01,272
I gave him last christmas.

183
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:04,019
And the same paper I wrapped it in

184
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:05,854
and the note I wrote.

185
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,307
We gotta go.

186
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,134
Heartbeat?

187
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:15,421
150.

188
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:17,282
B.P. 180 over 110.
Crackling.

189
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:18,962
3/4 of the way up.

190
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:23,329
Guess this means
she didn't try to kill herself.

191
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,071
Well, scratch the hallucinations.
That's from the mushrooms.

192
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:35,669
Leaves liver failure
and now pulmonary edema.

193
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,594
And you,

194
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:40,555
Standing there, beseechingly.

195
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:44,142
I was going to stalk you at home, it was
a busy week, your office is closer.

196
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,336
Thirteen and Foreman
were busy drug trialing

197
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,827
and we needed an answer on the overdose,
so we called her in.

198
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,554
She's just updating us.

199
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,857
- Convenient.
- Update's done.

200
00:10:57,015 --> 00:11:00,187
This is a good experience for me,
as my parents never got divorced.

201
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:02,202
- Theories?
- Glue sniffing.

202
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:04,288
Effects on the lungs
would have been immediate.

203
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,006
House, we all know
what's going on here.

204
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:09,209
Cuddy gave you that present.

205
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,555
No.

206
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,048
Infections?

207
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,024
No fever, no polys in the sputum.

208
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,193
I think...

209
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,093
She loves you.

210
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:20,273
I told you to lay off the present.

211
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:21,971
And the L.S.D.

212
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:24,546
We got distracted
by the painkillers.

213
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,894
- Toxins are still the most likely...
- Just tell her how you feel.

214
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,939
If you won't, then I will.

215
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:32,691
I'll walk right down there.

216
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:35,295
Damn it.
Love like this

217
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,654
needs to fly free.

218
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:45,040
You talked to Wilson.

219
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,539
He has very girly handwriting,
by the way.

220
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:50,000
I knew I should have
just wrapped a new present.

221
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,840
You said the patient volunteered.
Where?

222
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,212
Pleasant valley.

223
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,809
Soup kitchen in trenton.

224
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,850
Thirteen and Kutner,
search the home and the school.

225
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,430
You take the anal swabbing

226
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:06,641
of the fragrant and contagious
homeless man.

227
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,117
Why don't you hang out
in the video store

228
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:14,946
and tell everyone
Kevin Spacey's keyser soze?

229
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,708
And by the way, that ending
really made no sense at all.

230
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:21,839
You had my present for a year
and didn't even open it?

231
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:24,284
I had no way of knowing
there was an expensive book inside.

232
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,180
Completely meaningless prank,
even for you.

233
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:29,909
Stealing your ice cream
is a completely meaningless,

234
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,599
albeit delicious, prank.

235
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,113
Observing my team's reactions
to unexplained phenomena

236
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:35,543
could've been pretty useful.

237
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,846
Of all the ways to mess with people,
why

238
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:40,387
give yourself an imaginary present?

239
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:43,012
Have you checked the prices
for fireman strippers recently?

240
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:44,240
Yes.

241
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:45,942
The holidays...

242
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,183
They're hard for you. I get it.

243
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:50,685
You see the people around you

244
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,210
giving and receiving gifts,
having sustained,

245
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:55,357
meaningful relationships,
and since you can't,

246
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,067
something deep in your subconscious
makes you create

247
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,130
the appearance of a gift.

248
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:01,988
Sad.

249
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:04,366
You really passed
your psych rotation?

250
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,210
It's too bad you can't just
be nice to people.

251
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:09,246
You could get
a real present that way.

252
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:10,989
If I wanted gifts,

253
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,404
I would just look deep into
my patients'eyes and act like you.

254
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:18,052
"Oh, I'm so sorry you're dying,
mrs. Moron.

255
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,093
"Of course I'll sleep with you.

256
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:22,050
What I lack in skill
I can make up for... "

257
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,512
you'd just wind up insulting her,
perhaps calling her mrs. Moron.

258
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:28,473
Right, 'cause I'm physically
incapable of being polite.

259
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:32,072
Being kind in a sustained,
meaningful way?

260
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:33,928
No.

261
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:35,592
Oh, I get it.

262
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,923
You're trying to get me
to prove you wrong,

263
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:41,070
then I'm gonna be nice to my patients
all through the holiday season,

264
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,956
and then Mr. Potter won't
steal tiny tim's porridge.

265
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,521
- I'm totally on it.
- Yeah,

266
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:47,325
that actually
is what I'm trying to do.

267
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:50,657
And the pathetic part is,

268
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:52,426
it's not gonna work.

269
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:55,123
You're right.

270
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:58,169
I gotta stop being such a jerk.

271
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:04,967
Just kind of undercut myself, there.

272
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:19,900
Janice?

273
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:23,072
- I'm Remy. I'm...
- Yeah, I remember you.

274
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:28,950
I heard you left the trial.

275
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,584
If there's some way I could help...

276
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:36,757
It... It was that doctor.
He...

277
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:39,628
- The one that was runnin'the tests.
- Dr. Foreman.

278
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:42,469
He's a great neurologist.
He is

279
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,675
- a great guy.
- You... you like him?

280
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:47,604
Why don't you?

281
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,851
I told him that those injections

282
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:54,419
were making me sick in my stomach,
and he just

283
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,075
gave me antacid.

284
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,089
We were warned
that nausea's a side effect,

285
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:00,805
and giving you antacids
is all he really could do.

286
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,239
He told me,

287
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:05,554
"get over it."

288
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,139
With or without the use of drugs,

289
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:11,668
I don't have

290
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:13,537
a long time.

291
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:19,209
I'm not gonna spend it
bein'his guinea pig.

292
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:26,825
It's tuberculosis.

293
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,343
You got that from an anal swab?

294
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,895
- Man, you're good.
- There was a more subtle clue.

295
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,308
Homeless guy,

296
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,514
uncontrollably hacking up blood.

297
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,978
Cough's lasted two months,
he was cachectic.

298
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,404
Unless you can
tie him to the patient...

299
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,006
Yes, again, if only
there was some subtle clue,

300
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:46,608
like the fact that he was standing next
to her in the soup line for a week.

301
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:49,114
- I hate spunk.
- T.B. can cause liver failure,

302
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,947
lung symptoms...
Fits.

303
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:53,743
Start her on the standard regimen.

304
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,453
You don't have clinic duty today.

305
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:58,039
Who says it's a duty?

306
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:03,302
- Hi. I'm Greg.
- Hi, I'm Whitney.

307
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,711
Hi, Whitney.
How can I help you?

308
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:08,452
I have a...
A terrible headache.

309
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,552
Sorry to hear that.

310
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,670
I'll get you fixed up.

311
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,570
Is there anything else you need?

312
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:16,309
Bottle of water?
Coffee?

313
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:18,633
- Mint tea?
- No, but that's so nice.

314
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,342
Usually the clinic doctors
are kind of rushed.

315
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,649
If you can't be nice,
why be a doctor?

316
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:27,698
So where do you feel the pain?

317
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,537
In the back of my head here.

318
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,325
That's beccaria's sign.
That'll be gone by your third trimester.

319
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:35,660
I'm not in school.

320
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:39,289
Neither is your fetus.

321
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:43,793
- Oh, God.
- You didn't know you were pregnant?

322
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,254
How do... you know that
just from the headache?

323
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,703
How do I know?

324
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:53,110
I missed my period,
I got fat, threw up,

325
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:55,766
No, wait...
That's how you know.

326
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:56,640
What?

327
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,891
I know because of the tight shirt
stretched over the swollen boobs,

328
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:02,019
the salt craving you've
imported into the clinic,

329
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,314
the motion sickness patch
that doesn't do anything

330
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,483
for the sickness
that you feel in the morning.

331
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,250
Yeah, I'm a virgin.

332
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,695
So is my fiancé.

333
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,067
I believe him.

334
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:15,111
Aren't there other ways
I could get pregnant, like...

335
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,327
sitting on a toilet seat?

336
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:18,984
Absolutely... there

337
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,197
It would need to be a guy
between you and the seat,

338
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:22,715
but yes, absolutely.

339
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,076
I was doing so well.

340
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:37,105
- Oh, God. Natalie.
- She's having a seizure.

341
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:40,108
- Put her on her side. Nurse!
- Is this from the T.B.?

342
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,602
Not with the supple neck.
I don't know what this is.

343
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:44,479
Four milligrams lorazepam.

344
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:51,611
Liver, lungs, and now brain...

345
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,556
Which has mysteriously reappeared.

346
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,493
Speaking of mysteriously reappeared.

347
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,453
Her A.L.T. is 20 times normal.

348
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,689
Transaminases and P.T.'s way up.

349
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:05,500
She's gonna lose her liver.
We gotta get her on the transplant list.

350
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:07,251
You keep showing up.

351
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,837
You also keep leaving.

352
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,797
It's possible that you
have the hots for me,

353
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,799
but really, really hate this kid.

354
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,816
It's also remotely possible
that I have that reversed.

355
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:18,513
She's a nice kid.
I wanna make sure she's okay.

356
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,138
- Hepatic fibrosis?
- Normal complement level,

357
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:24,097
- normal-sized liver.
- She remind you of... You?

358
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,009
You weren't a loser in high school.

359
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:30,039
You had every Tom, Dick,
and Hershel wet-dreaming about you.

360
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:33,075
But she could be making you
think of another helpless,

361
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,330
chubby little girl you recently met.

362
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:38,700
You are not really making this
about the baby I tried to adopt.

363
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:40,818
It's been a few weeks.

364
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:43,288
Just enough time
to get over hurt feelings.

365
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:44,954
Natalie's 16.

366
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:49,004
I think you're confusing
being maternal with being human.

367
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:53,423
- If we hadn't ruled out mushrooms...
- Maybe we shouldn't have.

368
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,682
Forget toxic...
Think allergic.

369
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,259
Severe mold allergy
could cause liver failure,

370
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,418
respiratory arrest,
and encephalopathy.

371
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:03,079
She ate the'shrooms days ago.
There's no way she'd still be sick.

372
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,602
Unless it also gave her
a fungal infection.

373
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:08,208
Give her a prick test
in antifungals.

374
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:19,595
Thank you for the gift.
I really appreciate it.

375
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:21,873
I spoke to janice.

376
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,536
She okay?

377
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:29,375
Her nausea...
She said you told her to, like,

378
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:30,585
get over it?

379
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:31,792
And?

380
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:36,841
Nausea isn't something
you can overcome with sheer willpower.

381
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:39,698
Which is why I didn't
prescribe willpower.

382
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:41,025
I prescribed antacids.

383
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,785
If she can't handle that,
she'd have to leave the trial anyway.

384
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:47,101
Just call her, say you're sorry.
She'll come back.

385
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:51,105
God, you're acting like House now.

386
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,019
No, I'm not acting like House,

387
00:19:53,144 --> 00:19:55,068
which is exactly why
I don't need to apologize.

388
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,982
- I'm not being cruel, manipulative.
- You said the same thing

389
00:19:58,107 --> 00:20:00,899
- when I told you I had a hard time.
- And it worked.

390
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:03,759
She's a 40-year-old woman
who's falling apart

391
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:05,660
physically and emotionally.

392
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:06,746
She's dying.

393
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,549
Look,

394
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,376
I know seeing the ghost
of your Christmas future is tough.

395
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,081
But the only way I can help her
is to make sure she follows her regimen,

396
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:16,831
not by becoming her life coach.

397
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:19,517
You're not acting like House.

398
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,669
You are like him.

399
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:31,257
This is my fiancé geoff.

400
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:35,900
She says you told her you can get
pregnant from sitting on a toilet seat.

401
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:41,447
I said those words,
but with a particular inflection.

402
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,275
- I knew it was untrue.
- Is there any other way?

403
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,613
Isn't it possible?

404
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:50,206
There was a reported case
of a civil war soldier

405
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,125
who was shot in the testicles,

406
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:56,212
and the musket ball
carried the non-musket ball

407
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:59,070
into the uterus of a woman working
in a neighboring field.

408
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:01,509
Nine months later,
a miracle child was born.

409
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:05,231
Also, maybe she cheated on you.

410
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:06,939
We made a promise.

411
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:09,290
We d... we do other stuff in bed.

412
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:11,769
Couldn't some of his sperm
have made it up there somehow?

413
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:15,440
More likely, it came from the guy
whose penis made it up there somehow.

414
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,320
- But sure, anything's possible.
- I want a paternity test.

415
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,947
Tell him that amnios are dangerous
this early on in the pregnancy.

416
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:25,477
- Are they?
- Well, who cares? He doesn't know.

417
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:29,254
Well, we'll...
we'll do the paternity test.

418
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,836
No reaction.

419
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:38,569
That's bad?

420
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:40,844
If you had mold allergy,
it would explain symptoms.

421
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:42,853
We'll find out what's wrong,
don't worry.

422
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:43,780
And, uh,

423
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:46,763
I know some things are hard
to talk about with your parents around,

424
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,427
but kids can be really mean.
There are people you can talk to...

425
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:51,225
- Programs...
- I'll... I'll be okay.

426
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,526
You're in good spirits.
You feeling better?

427
00:21:57,301 --> 00:21:59,412
I was just doing my homework.

428
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:01,885
I'm such a dork,
I guess that cheers me up.

429
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,141
Parents brought it?

430
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:04,485
No, Simon did.

431
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:07,165
The jocky kid in your class?

432
00:22:08,508 --> 00:22:09,576
He just left.

433
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:14,147
Security.

434
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,886
- I was just bringing her her homework.
- You helped bully this little girl

435
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:20,088
and completely refuse
to accept responsibility.

436
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:22,664
No way you came here out of compassion.
That only leaves guilt.

437
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:24,092
- What'd you do?
- Nothing.

438
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,965
Stop lying. Or I'll take the drugs
I found in your locker down to the cops,

439
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,493
you slimy little jerk.

440
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:33,444
- He didn't do anything to you.
- This isn't about me.

441
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:36,636
I get it. You were bullied yourself
when you were in school.

442
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,646
- Take it easy.
- I wasn't bullied.

443
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:41,359
Right... The Indian foster kid
whose parents were shot in front of him.

444
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,532
You were clearly homecoming king.

445
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:48,533
Let's try this again.

446
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:50,952
- Just tell me...
- Honestly, you don't understand.

447
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,237
We used to be friends.

448
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,742
And I'd be friends
with her now if, you know,

449
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,458
people wouldn't make fun of me.

450
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,508
There's nothing you could
tell us that'll help?

451
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,613
Did she mention
she used to drink a lot?

452
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:09,252
How do you know that?

453
00:23:10,144 --> 00:23:12,057
Look, don't tell anyone, all right?

454
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:14,727
I had my brother's i.d.
And I kind of supplied people.

455
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,895
I used to get her
a few bottles of vodka each week.

456
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,469
Why'd you stop?

457
00:23:19,862 --> 00:23:22,391
She got her own i.d.
Said it was cheaper buying it herself.

458
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:24,072
You can go.

459
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,117
I think we got our diagnosis.
Our little girl's a drunk.

460
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:37,092
I don't drink.

461
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:40,988
- I did back then, but...
- You could die.

462
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:45,256
We can't get you on the transplant list
until we know why your liver is failing.

463
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,124
Alcohol abuse would explain that.

464
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:52,597
- The seizures could be from withdrawal.
- I haven't drunk in six months.

465
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:55,293
I didn't even drink
that much back then.

466
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:57,351
A couple of vodka bottles a week?

467
00:23:58,183 --> 00:23:59,974
I didn't open half of them.

468
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:02,832
I just bought them because...

469
00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:06,415
You know, 'cause Simon
was selling them.

470
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,737
We used to be friends.

471
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,198
And that's the only way
I could get him to even talk to me.

472
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,955
Then why did you stop buying from him?
He said you got your own i.d.

473
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:16,091
I don't know.

474
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,447
See, that's not a good answer.

475
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:21,515
Remember when you asked me
if I had any kids?

476
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,514
I don't. I don't know, maybe it
has nothing to do with it,

477
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:28,771
but I was good at school,
good at work, lousy at life.

478
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:31,274
I screwed up every
relationship I ever had.

479
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,383
And I thought,"why would I
want to bring a child into this?"

480
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,802
But then I got older.

481
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:38,122
And...

482
00:24:42,143 --> 00:24:44,440
How you feel now will pass.

483
00:24:45,232 --> 00:24:47,447
Don't let it screw up
your whole life.

484
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:50,696
It's already screwed up.

485
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:54,625
My asthma.

486
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:56,463
They said they'd fix it,

487
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:58,496
but it didn't make
any difference at all.

488
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:01,833
Well, sometimes
doctors make mistakes...

489
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,139
Anna, and then you have to try
twice as hard to fix them.

490
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:08,214
- Are you using your inhaler?
- All the time.

491
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,908
Go through one a week.

492
00:25:10,627 --> 00:25:12,437
You sure you're using it right?

493
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,573
Do I look like an idiot?

494
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,383
Why don't you show me
how your inhaler works?

495
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:30,430
Jerk.

496
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:37,040
- What was that all about?
- Jamaican chicken recipes.

497
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,325
The parents said no to the benzos,

498
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,813
but I still think Natalie's
not being honest with me.

499
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:44,375
So she's willing to die
to cover up some boozing.

500
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:45,581
She's depressed.

501
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:48,546
She feels like she deserves
what the kids are dishing out on her.

502
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:50,670
I think she either wants to die

503
00:25:50,795 --> 00:25:53,362
or she wants the attention
that dying gives her.

504
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,643
I have no idea why you care so much.

505
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:57,555
Tell Kutner to start her on benzos.

506
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,288
House, the parents just...

507
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,859
Not the alcoholism.
Seizures. Totally different.

508
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:03,644
Don't need their approval for that.

509
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:11,319
You sure you want to know?

510
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:14,155
If it makes it any easier,
I'm gonna tell you anyway.

511
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,527
We want to know.

512
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:23,756
What does it say?

513
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:36,828
Don't leave.

514
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,091
You go home last night?

515
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,315
I meant to.
Started reading this file,

516
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,876
just couldn't put it down.

517
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:52,305
Let me ask you...

518
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:55,061
That patient that dropped out,
the one I told you about...

519
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,458
You think I should pursue it more?

520
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,701
No, patients drop out.
That's why we start with hundreds.

521
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,181
Well, I just thought

522
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:05,597
there's an easy way to make the people
who drop off come back, then why not...

523
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:07,934
- They're not people.
- Really?

524
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,753
I thought the zombie trials
were all completed during phase two.

525
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:13,714
You can't see the patients as people.
You can't even see them as patients.

526
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,903
- They're numbers.
- Look...

527
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,096
- A friend of mine has this disease.
- I don't wanna know.

528
00:27:20,658 --> 00:27:22,928
There's a reason
if this is double-blind...

529
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:24,999
Any personal stake
we have skews the studies.

530
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:27,895
Science is not about
human relationships. It's about results.

531
00:27:28,117 --> 00:27:30,080
Now, you know that.
You work for House.

532
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:32,431
Why do you think I
brought you on as my partner?

533
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:37,647
She was talking to me
and she passed out.

534
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:39,971
- Her heart's slowing down.
- Can you fix it?

535
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,159
- Can you fix it?
- I'm trying.

536
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,510
Pushing one amp atropine.

537
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:56,154
We've been waiting
here for six hours.

538
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,306
Am I the father or not?

539
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,763
No. But...

540
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:05,868
She also didn't cheat on you.

541
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:13,957
Normally, sperm meets egg,

542
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,527
DNA meets DNA,
goes back to her place,

543
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,838
cells divide, nine months later,

544
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:20,781
joy is bundled.

545
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,206
That's normally.

546
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:25,536
Abnormally, an egg could have two...

547
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:29,540
naturally occurring gene mutations
that don't naturally occur together.

548
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,832
A spontaneous calcium spike could prep
the egg for fertilization without sperm,

549
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:38,315
and a division mistake
could let the egg split up

550
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,968
without ever needing
male DNA at all.

551
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:42,838
Parthenogenesis.

552
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,847
A baby without a daddy.

553
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:48,708
In humans, it's only ever been
theorized, but it was never proved.

554
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:51,609
Until now.

555
00:28:53,944 --> 00:28:55,633
- Mommy.
- Baby.

556
00:28:55,758 --> 00:28:58,986
Your daughter has only maternal DNA.

557
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:00,863
I personally checked
this five times.

558
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,143
In seven months,

559
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,492
you will have...

560
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:09,044
a virgin birth.

561
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:12,570
Merry christmas.

562
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,935
Gotta tell you about
this clinic patient.

563
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:30,434
Natalie's liver is continuing to fail.
And now bradycardia.

564
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:32,354
Atropine isn't keeping
the heart rate up.

565
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,390
We're gonna have to
put her on a pacemaker.

566
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:38,224
Alcohol withdrawal would
cause her heart to race, not crawl.

567
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,283
There's nothing
wrong with her heart.

568
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:42,488
EKG, echo, electrolyte panel
are all normal.

569
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:45,518
- Multiple endocrine syndrome?
- Free t-4's normal.

570
00:29:45,643 --> 00:29:48,650
- Hypothalamic brain tumor?
- Didn't come up on the CT Scan.

571
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:51,602
It's hitting all her organs.

572
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:53,912
Could be the blood.
What's her alk phos?

573
00:29:57,986 --> 00:29:58,754
300.

574
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,725
It can't be leukemia.

575
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:09,702
High alk phos could
also be from liver failure.

576
00:30:09,827 --> 00:30:12,986
She's a teenager, means bone growth
and destruction could throw it off.

577
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:15,187
Maybe, but it's higher
than you'd expect.

578
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,013
Start her on chemo.

579
00:30:18,976 --> 00:30:20,901
We'll do a bone marrow
biopsy to confirm.

580
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:23,028
Why are you ordering
tests instead of treatment?

581
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,989
Her heart and liver
are about to give up.

582
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,449
Do whatever you need to.

583
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,743
Why are you so
attached to this girl?

584
00:30:33,142 --> 00:30:34,414
It's your call.

585
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,824
He doesn't want us to treat her.

586
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:42,131
If it's leukemia, even if we kill
every cancer cell,

587
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,592
- her heart and liver are too far gone.
- Double transplant.

588
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,062
With brain involvement?

589
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:48,332
The committee won't
even open the file.

590
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:51,070
There's no reason
to put a dying girl

591
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:53,603
through a painful treatment
if it can't save her.

592
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:58,689
He's being kind.

593
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:01,897
I'll arrange a biopsy.

594
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,104
Mrs. Burke?

595
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:17,513
We are conducting another
trial in tandem with yours.

596
00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:19,590
Same drug, lower dose.

597
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:22,379
The nausea will be less.

598
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:25,302
I did some checking.

599
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,967
I can switch you.

600
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:31,348
Here's the forms
if you want back in.

601
00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:40,498
What if we're wrong?

602
00:31:40,856 --> 00:31:43,357
Maybe we shouldn't have
overlooked autoimmunes.

603
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:44,769
High sed rate...

604
00:31:44,894 --> 00:31:46,331
we went over this.

605
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:48,171
Normal complement level.

606
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,240
So it isn't hepatic fibrosis.

607
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:51,949
Could still be...

608
00:31:52,074 --> 00:31:54,578
Microangiopathic vasculitis.

609
00:31:55,551 --> 00:31:58,415
With high-dose steroids,
we might be able to reverse...

610
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,679
you run a hospital that treats
thousands of patients every day.

611
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:04,245
Some of them die.
Every day.

612
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:07,404
If you're gonna get this
worked up over every one of them...

613
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:09,292
yes!

614
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:15,307
BRB!

615
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:18,229
- What is it?
- Thank you from a patient.

616
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:19,699
For you?

617
00:32:20,096 --> 00:32:21,993
I saved her marriage by showing

618
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:24,817
that her pregnancy was
the result of parthenogenesis.

619
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:26,860
Human parthenogenesis?

620
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,484
- You proved...
- Yep.

621
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:29,670
It's unbelievable.

622
00:32:29,795 --> 00:32:31,574
But I personally
checked it five times.

623
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,082
How did you check it five times?
The cycler's broken,

624
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:36,795
you would have had to send it out.
It would have taken...

625
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:39,832
That does sound impossible,
now that I think of it.

626
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,325
I guess the better explanation is that
the paternity test showed she cheated

627
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:45,546
so I faked the whole
parthenogenesis thingy.

628
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,798
- What?
- Why?

629
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:50,700
I win.

630
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:56,927
You faked a scientific miracle
just to win a bet with wilson?

631
00:32:57,365 --> 00:32:59,893
More an argument.
I realize it would have been simpler to

632
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:03,385
fake the paternity test, but hey...
Christmas spirit and all that.

633
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:07,276
I think you're confusing
nice and evil again.

634
00:33:07,577 --> 00:33:09,320
Letting a woman deceive her husband

635
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,162
by inventing a virgin birth
just so you can...

636
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:14,700
and it obviously would have been
more fitting if the baby

637
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,158
had been born on christmas,
not just invented then.

638
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,661
It's not leukemia.

639
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:23,375
Seizures, liver failure...

640
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:26,883
it's eclampsia.

641
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:32,514
This means we don't
have one dead patient.

642
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:35,638
We have two.

643
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:49,512
You have a disease called eclampsia.

644
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:51,022
It causes

645
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,489
liver failure, pulmonary edema,
and seizures.

646
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:56,922
It's also associated
with cardiomyopathy.

647
00:33:57,047 --> 00:33:58,661
That's a pregnancy disease.

648
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,114
You tested her when she came in.

649
00:34:02,455 --> 00:34:04,917
You can get eclampsia
up to a month after giving birth.

650
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:08,171
That's ridiculous.
How could she hide a pregnancy?

651
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,359
Loose clothes.
She's heavy to begin with.

652
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,091
It was probably premature.

653
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,302
If it was three weeks ago, they
could have missed it on a physical exam.

654
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,138
The baby's why you quit drinking,
isn't it?

655
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:22,231
Why you asked me if I had kids.

656
00:34:23,707 --> 00:34:24,853
Why you feel guilty.

657
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,210
I'm sorry.

658
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:34,807
Who did this to you?

659
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:36,406
Simon.

660
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,138
It wasn't bad.

661
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:43,455
We were like boyfriend/girlfriend
for a while, we just didn't tell anyone.

662
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,153
He doesn't even know about...

663
00:34:49,646 --> 00:34:51,213
what happened to the baby?

664
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,673
I was gonna give it away.

665
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:57,678
If they found out at school...

666
00:34:58,584 --> 00:35:01,014
I was at the soup kitchen
and she started coming.

667
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:04,558
There was this empty house down
the street, but...

668
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,395
then she wasn't breathing.

669
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,773
I tried so hard,
but I couldn't do anything.

670
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:13,547
I'm... so sorry.

671
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:20,014
If I had her in a hospital,
maybe she'd be alive.

672
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,223
Can you cure this?

673
00:35:24,425 --> 00:35:26,999
The damage to the heart
and liver are permanent.

674
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:29,793
I'm gonna die?

675
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:39,094
I'm sorry.

676
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:45,334
I didn't even bury her.

677
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:49,146
I just put my coat over her.

678
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:49,645
Get out of my house.

679
00:36:51,414 --> 00:36:52,334
I'm a doctor.

680
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:55,359
- I don't care who you are.
- Did you, uh...

681
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,381
find the body of a baby?

682
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,674
I said get out.

683
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:02,761
Michael?

684
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:06,118
Who are you?

685
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:12,844
That's not your baby.

686
00:37:14,302 --> 00:37:17,279
You're tiny. There's no way you
gave birth three weeks ago.

687
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,881
She's my sister's.

688
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,403
That baby is sick.
She needs clean water.

689
00:37:21,528 --> 00:37:22,823
She needs real heat.

690
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,919
She was probably born with
a partially blocked airway and...

691
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:28,996
might even have brain damage.

692
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:31,874
You can't take care
of her in a place like this.

693
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,148
Shut up.

694
00:37:35,154 --> 00:37:37,081
- I took care of her...
- I know.

695
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:40,101
You found her.

696
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:42,634
You saved her life.

697
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,309
Now you have to let her go.

698
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:24,885
Who is that?

699
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:26,383
It's your daughter.

700
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:28,132
She was alive.

701
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,380
People found her
and took care of her.

702
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:52,748
She's beautiful.

703
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:37,090
- No transplant?
- We appealed.

704
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:38,408
Too sick.

705
00:39:38,914 --> 00:39:41,712
- How much time does she have left?
- A couple of days at most.

706
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,060
What about the baby?

707
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:45,124
Seems healthy,
but it's too early to tell.

708
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:48,683
She's in the hospital for observation
for a few days, but after that...

709
00:39:48,808 --> 00:39:50,950
best case, winds up with
her teenage father

710
00:39:51,075 --> 00:39:54,027
who just got voted
captain of the varsity bullying team.

711
00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:55,308
He's just a kid.

712
00:39:57,717 --> 00:39:59,654
- You all right?
- I gotta go.

713
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:21,718
Jonathan.

714
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:25,589
It... it's, uh...
It's lawrence kutner.

715
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:29,276
Why are you here?

716
00:40:29,903 --> 00:40:31,094
I wanted to apologize.

717
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,472
For all of the horrible
stuff I did to you in high school.

718
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:36,683
I'm sorry.

719
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,220
What's gonna happen to her?

720
00:41:02,574 --> 00:41:04,829
I spoke to both
sets of grandparents.

721
00:41:06,428 --> 00:41:09,283
It's too painful.
They're putting her up for adoption.

722
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,223
What are you gonna do?

723
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,852
I already spoke to a lawyer.

724
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:23,563
I become a foster parent
and then I adopt.

725
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,236
Merry christmas, Cuddy.

726
00:42:06,752 --> 00:42:08,013
Where is everybody?

727
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:10,068
Down at the party.

728
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:14,034
I heard janice is back on the trial.

729
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:16,575
My christmas gift to you.

730
00:42:19,268 --> 00:42:20,431
I was wrong.

731
00:42:21,056 --> 00:42:22,163
You're not house.

732
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:26,560
Yeah, well,
that's my christmas gift to myself.

733
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,020
We should go to the party.

734
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,531
We should.

735
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,993
