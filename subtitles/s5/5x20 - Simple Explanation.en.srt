1
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,819
Bye.

2
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,862
i want to be alone...

3
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,598
with my wife.

4
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:48,448
I'm a selfish s.o.b.

5
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:53,153
I... i never got you to rio.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,392
There was always... one
more problem at the stores.

7
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,060
You deserve better than that.

8
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,498
I love you.

9
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,802
I always have.

10
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:16,209
I'm ready. It's okay.

11
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,351
I know...

12
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:53,313
somebody...

13
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:57,818
help her!

14
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,620
Help her!

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,755

Pour Tilyocean pour
docteur-house.niceboard.com

18
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,655
54-year-old woman with
acute respiratory failure.

19
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,291
No anaphylaxis, lung
issues, or tracheal lesions.

20
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,260
Tox screen was clean for
coke and amphetamines.

21
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,528
I will give you 30 reasons,

22
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,597
one for each pound that caused the apnea

23
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,400
which enflamed the epiglottis.

24
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,804
Why is our rainbow coalition
missing brown and bi?

25
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:52,306
Thirteen's with a patient,
and kutner's dog's sick.

26
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,241
He should be in by lunch.

27
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:56,643
No apnea because no sleeping
problems when she's sleeping.

28
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:58,979
She spent the last six
months caring for her husband

29
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,714
who's dying of heart failure.

30
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,716
Reason 31... whatever
whacked the husband's heart

31
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,984
is also whacking her airway.

32
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:05,485
And...oh, good.

33
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,688
I thought maybe kutner was
home nursing the rib you broke

34
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:10,691
when you elbowed your way in
for credit on the last patient.

35
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,359
I contributed.

36
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:14,195
And the patient's illness
wasn't caused by her husband

37
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,263
unless lung cancer's contagious.

38
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,798
Interesting. Not about the patient.

39
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,233
That was kinda dull.

40
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,101
I thought maybe you were
lying to cover for kutner,

41
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,636
which sounds noble,

42
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,472
except you're doing it out
of guilt instead of love.

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,210
She visited her sister in
hawaii about six months ago,

44
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:30,878
just before her husband got sick.

45
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:31,979
Could've picked up melioidosis

46
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,280
from one of the islands.

47
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:34,781
Would have jumped to the husband

48
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,451
and finished off him and
his lame immune system.

49
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,820
No tumors, no drugs, no bacteria.

50
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:41,655
Leaves viral... varicella zoster.

51
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,623
Start her on iv fluids and acyclovir.

52
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,726
Can't. She's demanding to be released

53
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,228
so she can get home to her husband.

54
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,730
How sweet. They can die together.

55
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,099
Instead of separately, 40 years apart.

56
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,768
She claims he got stronger

57
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:56,570
the mind can heal the body.

58
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,038
Seeing his wife in distress

59
00:03:58,106 --> 00:03:59,974
might have actually
slowed down his death.

60
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,508
Or he just had an adrenaline surge

61
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,978
when he saw his chance to
hit the singles' market.

62
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:07,514
Send her home. We don't need to.

63
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,017
I had an idea... all by myself.

64
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:17,824
Eddie?

65
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:19,826
Found him loitering in the lobby.

66
00:04:19,895 --> 00:04:21,461
You're still with me.

67
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,198
Where the hell else am i gonna go?

68
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,133
And now, with your permission,

69
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,369
we'd like to try to make you better.

70
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,777
The pageant starts in an hour.

71
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,178
You have to do something.

72
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:40,514
There's something wrong inside her head.

73
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,550
It's like she has no idea
what's going on around her.

74
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:46,753
I thought she was just flirting with me.

75
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:48,889
I can fix it, but it's gonna cost you...

76
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,891
$3.75.

77
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,962
I'm not just gonna give you my coffee.

78
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,565
Think of it as costa rican sober juice.

79
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,768
She's drunk?

80
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,337
That little minty scent

81
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:05,639
hiding beneath the rose petal perfume

82
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,474
and the cherry blossom moisturizer

83
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,776
and the morning dew hair spray.

84
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:13,680
You sneak into mommy's bathroom
and gulp some of her mouthwash?

85
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,383
Gotta be perfect.

86
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:21,221
You spit it out? Mommy doesn't.

87
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,622
Treatment worked.

88
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,358
Charlotte's breathing's back to normal.

89
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:25,759
She's being discharged.

90
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,561
She can resume her
vigil over her husband

91
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,728
who started fading again.

92
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,297
Win some, lose some.

93
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,566
And strictly speaking,
since he's not my patient,

94
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,068
win some.

95
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:35,469
Look at the time.

96
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,038
It's half past "taub
was lying about kutner."

97
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:40,607
He probably went to a comic book fest,

98
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:41,775
spent the night at some
wonder woman's lair.

99
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,143
I'm sure he'll...

100
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,379
find out what or who he's doing.

101
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:47,214
Either way, cuddy's
gonna want me to write it

102
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:48,482
under "reason for termination."

103
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,351
That kutner?

104
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:51,852
Charlotte.

105
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,888
02 sat and s-t are normal.
It's not her airway.

106
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,026
You're okay. Don't worry about me.

107
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:01,862
She's in pain.

108
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,031
Pulse is rabid and regular.
No fluid in her lungs.

109
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:07,567
What's happening? I don't know.

110
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:15,275
Kutner. It's foreman and thirteen.

111
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,743
Where are you going?

112
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,246
House didn't ask us to
find out where he wasn't.

113
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:21,615
If you wanna climb a
fifth floor fire escape...

114
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,251
this might be faster.

115
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,789
Kutner.

116
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,592
Man/boy heaven.

117
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,895
Surprised he ever leaves.

118
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:42,869
There's nothing on his calendar.

119
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:45,639
His pager's still here.

120
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,246
Oh, god.

121
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:01,055
I need an ambulance at 410 willis,

122
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:02,322
apartment 5c.

123
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,590
28-year-old
male.

124
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:04,925
Single gunshot wound
to the right temple.

125
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,593
No pulse!

126
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:09,496
Alert princeton plainsboro.
Have a trauma unit ready.

127
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,865
His pupils dilated. His head's swollen.

128
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,567
Still no pulse.  Come on, kutner!

129
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,235
Let me try.

130
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:28,348
He's cold.

131
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:32,352
Eric!

132
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:10,975
He didn't say anything... to any of you.

133
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:13,077
Family problems...

134
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:15,780
bad relationship, financial pressures?

135
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:19,150
His parents were shot
right in front of him.

136
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:20,685
Parents are ancient history.

137
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:22,519
Not to someone who actually cares.

138
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:26,523
He didn't slit his wrists and...

139
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:30,027
peacefully drift
away... he shot himself.

140
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:33,964
He didn't leave a
note. That means panic.

141
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,700
Which could have been preempted

142
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,601
if the idiots who worked alongside him

143
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,103
for 80 hours a week
had seen this coming.

144
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:41,538
You're blaming us?

145
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,307
Just trying to figure it out.

146
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,409
We would have helped him
if he had reached out to us.

147
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:47,178
He didn't.

148
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:48,813
We should have picked up on something.

149
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,148
This isn't our fault!

150
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:53,483
Something like 25% of suicidal people

151
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,452
show no outward signs of depression.

152
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,521
No. 25% of suicidal people

153
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:59,123
have friends who didn't notice anything

154
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,891
and don't want to feel guilty.

155
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,861
Killing himself also
kills all other options,

156
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:07,397
makes kutner an idiot.

157
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,834
So pity, yes, but guilt, no.

158
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,869
That's what you wanna tell yourself.

159
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:15,239
We still have a patient. Actually, two.

160
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:18,275
One worsening, one who
should be worsening.

161
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:21,011
You can't be in denial about
kutner and the husband  .

162
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:24,148
It's possible eddie's body
is willing itself to live.

163
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:26,250
Well, call the tabloids.

164
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,018
Tell them you just witnessed the miracle

165
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:31,521
of slightly increased kidney function.

166
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:34,024
Maybe we should pass this
file off to another doctor.

167
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:36,393
And the next one too?

168
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:40,497
The one after that?

169
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:43,868
How many files till it's
okay that kutner's dead?

170
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:49,974
Cardiac enzymes means she
didn't have a heart attack.

171
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,977
No vision problems means
no mitochondrial disease.

172
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:55,612
Could be a metabolic disorder, acidosis.

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,447
Blood ph was normal.

174
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:59,250
Polyserositis would
inflame the membranes

175
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:01,652
near her epiglottis and
the heart's pericardium,

176
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,453
causing the chest pain.

177
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:06,223
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,358
I've hired a grief counselor

179
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:10,027
whom i'm sure none of you will see,

180
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,528
and i'm offering time off,

181
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,664
which i'm sure none of you will take.

182
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:17,567
But just know it's available.

183
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,138
Polyserositis fits.

184
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:24,141
Start her on indomethacin.

185
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:29,780
If you'd rather not
deal with this case...

186
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:33,383
i'm fine... despite
what wilson will say.

187
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:34,919
He hasn't come to you?

188
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:37,654
Pretty sure he has
mah-jongg tuesday mornings.

189
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,124
I assume he thinks i will
work through this better

190
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:43,961
if i don't have to keep flicking
his wings off my shoulder.

191
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,032
You didn't even have an inkling?

192
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,767
I know his fantasy
football team cratered.

193
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:54,004
Figured he'd gotten over it.

194
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:56,373
Well...

195
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:03,180
sorry for your loss.

196
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:06,183
Thanks. But it's not my loss.

197
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:09,220
Then i'm sorry you don't think it is.

198
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:20,264
Patient's membranes aren't
gonna heal themselves.

199
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:23,000
Taub went to run the treatment.

200
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:26,703
We'd like to go see kutner's parents.

201
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,640
I'll join you.

202
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:40,251
Polyserositis damages
the protective covering

203
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:41,919
around tissue and organs.

204
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:44,088
The indomethacin is simply
an anti-inflammatory,

205
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:45,923
but it should fix it.

206
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:48,859
Just make the pain stop.

207
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:52,162
Charlotte...

208
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,100
close your eyes.

209
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:59,503
Now...

210
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,774
pretend you... finally
made it down to rio.

211
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:09,079
You're on the balcony of a...

212
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:12,449
some fancy hotel.

213
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:15,119
You never talk like this.

214
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:18,022
Yeah, just...shut up and let me do this.

215
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,090
And you're on that balcony,

216
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:22,759
and you're watching the mardi gras.

217
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:25,662
It's called carnival.

218
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,167
And i don't wanna go without you.

219
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:33,770
I want you to.

220
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:38,142
And i want it to be everything
you've ever dreamed of.

221
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,110
Sorry to interrupt...

222
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:42,846
but i'd like to run one more test...

223
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:44,448
on you.

224
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:51,055
This is the first day we got him.

225
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:53,023
He was six.

226
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:56,693
Sweetest little boy you ever met.

227
00:12:56,761 --> 00:13:00,497
Must have been scary...
going through a trauma

228
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:03,467
and then being handed
off to a new family.

229
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,837
We kept telling him to
call us richard and julia,

230
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:09,273
but it was always mr. And mrs. Kutner.

231
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:13,844
And on his ninth birthday,
we gave him a chemistry set.

232
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:18,115
Lawrence always loved blowing things up.

233
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:23,153
And he said, "thanks, mom. Thanks, dad."

234
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:25,522
That's who we were from then on.

235
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,694
He was pretty special.

236
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,130
We were lucky to have him.

237
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:36,333
You spent the most time with him.

238
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:39,336
He spoke so highly of all of you.

239
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:43,974
Do you have any idea?

240
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:46,676
Wish we did.

241
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:50,580
We all... it was his name.

242
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:54,118
He was conflicted, didn't
know where he fit in.

243
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:58,288
Being ripped out of his
world and stuck into yours.

244
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:01,258
We encouraged him to
hold on to his heritage.

245
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,427
It's hard to still be lawrence choudhary

246
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:05,729
when everyone sees
you as lawrence kutner.

247
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:07,864
It was his idea to take our name.

248
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,267
Then you should have said no. House.

249
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:12,002
All his anglo name gave him

250
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,637
was the illusion that
he was someone he wasn't.

251
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:15,906
You were being emotional, not rational.

252
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:17,441
You didn't understand him.

253
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:19,910
We loved that boy, you son of a bitch.

254
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:23,047
You wanted to make him happy
by shutting out his pain.

255
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:26,083
When he looked happy, you
assumed the pain had gone.

256
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:27,918
It just got buried deeper...

257
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:30,387
leaving him tormented about who he was

258
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:32,022
until finally he put a bullet...

259
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,291
house!

260
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:37,394
Go back to the hospital.

261
00:14:58,383 --> 00:14:59,649
I'm sorry about your son.

262
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:13,797
Indomethacin had no effect.

263
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:16,533
She's still in pain.
Rules out polyserositis.

264
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:17,767
I ran a hormone panel on eddie.

265
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,136
His prolactin's above normal.

266
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:22,973
Means he's actually improving.

267
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,609
Body chemistry changes
for all sorts of reasons...

268
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,377
stress, fear... why not love?

269
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,580
But maybe he's going into
some sort of remission.

270
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:31,915
You haven't asked if i
learned anything relevant

271
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,317
from the kutners.

272
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:35,619
If you had, i'm sure
you'd have mentioned it.

273
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,188
Or you're just afraid
there is something relevant.

274
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:39,856
Which would mean you
could have saved him.

275
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:43,059
I don't buy that suicide
is always a cry for help.

276
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:46,296
Sometimes you just don't want help.

277
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:49,566
Good thing you got some...

278
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:54,704
or you'd have tried
again and gotten it right.

279
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:57,674
She doesn't have wegener's.

280
00:15:57,742 --> 00:16:01,378
Kidney function's normal.
It's not byssinosis.

281
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:04,981
It's not mitral valve
stenosis. Nothing fits.

282
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:08,218
If it doesn't fit any diagnosis...

283
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:11,655
it just leaves one diagnosis.

284
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,794
I'm dr. House.

285
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:19,429
You have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

286
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,731
His heart is too weak.
Yours is too strong.

287
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,300
Good news is it's fixable.

288
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,001
We induce a massive heart attack

289
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,470
and kill off the extra muscle.

290
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:27,937
You wanna give me a heart attack?

291
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,340
It's only dangerous if
your heart is normal size.

292
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:33,143
But since all the... are you serious?

293
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:35,011
No.

294
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,880
This is actually very annoying,

295
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:38,815
and i'm getting really
bored of lying to patients

296
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:40,116
to scare them into telling me the truth.

297
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:41,718
She's faking.

298
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:44,054
And yes, if she keeps faking,

299
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:46,723
i'm going to eventually do
something that will kill her.

300
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,092
How could she be... the windpipe thing?

301
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,161
That was real. Treatment
made her better.

302
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:52,696
But good for her was bad for you,

303
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,998
which was bad for her,
so she made herself bad.

304
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:56,500
It's all so simple.

305
00:16:56,568 --> 00:17:01,438
She figured the sicker she
was, the longer you'd hang on.

306
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:03,807
Charlotte?

307
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:11,014
We haven't been this close for years.

308
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:13,717
I wanted to hang on to that.

309
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:18,655
Oh, please. People hate reruns.

310
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:20,857
It's my leg. I swear this is real!

311
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:23,026
What, you pinky swear,
or you just plain swear?

312
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:24,428
Because...

313
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:29,633
how can she fake that?

314
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:32,736
She can't.

315
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,943
so...what can shred an epiglottis

316
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,878
and make muscle disappear?

317
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:42,882
Mr. And mrs. Kutner.

318
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,651
They caused kutner's
death. Why not charlotte's?

319
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,419
Mourning period's over.

320
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,054
Foreman's sense of irony is back.

321
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:51,791
I was wrong about the ethnic reason.

322
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,461
Step one... change your name back.

323
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:56,529
Step two... if step one fails,

324
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:58,965
move to bangalore.

325
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:01,768
Step 14... if step 13
doesn't work, kill yourself.

326
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,070
So what now... you gonna insult
your way through his rolodex

327
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:05,572
till you find someone with an answer?

328
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:07,406
I've been polite to
the friends i've called,

329
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:09,976
all of whom were useless.
They weren't useless.

330
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:12,479
They just didn't know
anything more than we did.

331
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,013
Tomato, tomah-to.

332
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:16,415
M.s. Weakens myelin sheath,
compromises nerve conduction.

333
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,785
I'm talking about charlotte,
the one who's still alive.

334
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:21,020
You two, stick her in an mri.

335
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,322
Confirm m.s.

336
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,657
And you run the echo on eddie

337
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,593
that you're planning
to do behind my back

338
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,428
to see if his heart's improving.

339
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,733
Did you let me hire a pervert?

340
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:36,102
Well, it would
hypocritical of me not to.

341
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:39,171
Kutner's police background
check from when he started.

342
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:41,307
He was charged with indecent exposure.

343
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,643
Kutner streaked at the
penn-dartmouth football game.

344
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:47,179
Precisely the kind of thing
you'd expect him to do.

345
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:50,617
It's okay. You should be upset.

346
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:53,386
He thought like you,
pushed boundaries like you.

347
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:55,755
If he thought like me...

348
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:57,456
he would have known
that living in misery

349
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:01,260
sucks marginally less than dying in it.

350
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:05,231
Just a few more minutes,

351
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:08,267
then we'll get you back to eddie.

352
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:10,336
What's it like, 30
years with the same man?

353
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:13,105
Great for me.

354
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:16,308
Good for him, i hope.

355
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:18,144
You don't think he loves you?

356
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:21,147
I think he always loved me in his way.

357
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:24,116
Just not in the "spend
time with me or show emotion

358
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:28,154
or any affection for me" sort of way.

359
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:31,223
Why did you stay?

360
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,193
I didn't need him to feel about me

361
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,729
the way i did about him.

362
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:39,632
Love...doesn't...

363
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,569
charlotte?

364
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,008
I've heard stories

365
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:53,880
of cancer patients going
into spontaneous remission.

366
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:56,148
You think this might
be that sort of thing?

367
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:57,650
It's unlikely, but you never know.

368
00:19:57,718 --> 00:20:00,019
If i just had a little more time...

369
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:03,656
be with charlotte, try
and do better by her.

370
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,024
Yeah, maybe.

371
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:07,526
You don't think i mean it.

372
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:10,329
I think you mean it now.

373
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:11,564
I think it's much easier to mean it

374
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:13,633
than to do anything about it.

375
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,310
Chamber walls are barely moving.

376
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:26,846
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:43,362
He needs a friend.

378
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,266
I can't...deal with this and house.

379
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:48,835
You need a friend too.

380
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,970
You couldn't give a crap what i need.

381
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,107
You just want someone
to take care of him.

382
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:03,116
He told kutner's parents
it was their fault.

383
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:11,858
Ruptured spleen. Means it's not m.s.

384
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:13,793
What are you doing here?

385
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:15,762
Waiting for you to fix her spleen

386
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:17,630
so we can biopsy it for
rheumatoid arthritis.

387
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:19,431
I'll do it. Go home.

388
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:23,636
She's not your patient.
And kutner wasn't my friend.

389
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:27,273
Kutner wanted to die. Charlotte doesn't.

390
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,108
So in a contest for my
concern and interest,

391
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:30,810
she wins.

392
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:33,345
Okay, either you're
a cold-hearted bastard

393
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:34,881
or you're too miserable to face it.

394
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:37,150
Go home and cry.

395
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:40,053
It's not rheumatoid
arthritis. Her liver's scarred.

396
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,956
Whatever she's got, it's spreading.

397
00:22:01,075 --> 00:22:03,009
For the record,

398
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:07,814
i'm uncomfortable violating
a dead colleague's dignity.

399
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:15,688
It's only violating it
if you find something.

400
00:22:15,756 --> 00:22:18,758
Good to see you.

401
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:22,461
What are we looking for?

402
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:24,997
He was hiding.

403
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:26,298
Why?

404
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:29,769
Shame? Fear?

405
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:32,338
Are you okay?

406
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:35,241
It's okay not to be okay.

407
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:40,646
"Colonial warrior
blaster. Number one one."

408
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:43,449
He'd have spent months
tracking this down.

409
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:45,218
He had passions.

410
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:48,420
He was obviously in pain.

411
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:53,392
Does it really matter why?

412
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,028
He hung the bad with the good.

413
00:22:56,096 --> 00:23:00,466
His loss beside a reminder
of what he'd gained.

414
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:04,603
Means he was open about the pain.

415
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:06,305
Should mean that if it got worse,

416
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:08,540
he had no reason to hide it.

417
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:14,113
Here's how we're gonna
handle this, house.

418
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:17,183
We're gonna leave here
and go to the closest bar

419
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:19,385
and drink and tell stories

420
00:23:19,452 --> 00:23:23,055
about the time kutner
almost blew up an o.r.

421
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:26,159
And pass out in our own sick.

422
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:29,461
Sound like a plan?

423
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:52,952
What am i missing?

424
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,525
You've got that look.

425
00:23:59,592 --> 00:24:01,294
You figured this out.

426
00:24:03,763 --> 00:24:06,032
You're not here because
you care about kutner.

427
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:07,934
You're here because it's a mystery.

428
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:11,437
You're here for the puzzle.

429
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:13,306
What if i didn't miss anything...

430
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:18,510
'cause there's nothing to miss?

431
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:21,848
He didn't kill himself.

432
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:24,917
He was murdered.

433
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:45,549
Epiglottis muscle,
spleen, and now her liver,

434
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:48,818
which is operating at 20%
and deteriorating fast.

435
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:51,588
Autoimmune hepatitis?
Did you page foreman?

436
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:54,057
Took up cuddy's offer of time off.

437
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,393
Normal thyroid means no hepatitis.

438
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,261
Could be amyloidosis.

439
00:24:58,329 --> 00:24:59,796
Amyloid buildup hits
the organs, tissue...

440
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:01,064
her muscles wouldn't have atrophied.

441
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,899
You run the echo on the husband?

442
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,334
Heart's still failing.

443
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,570
The improvement was only temporary.

444
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:09,772
I prefer the less subtle
answer: you were right, house.

445
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,211
So...less time proving
why hubby isn't dead.

446
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:18,482
More time proving why kutner is.

447
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,517
Motives for murder.

448
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,120
House...it was a suicide.

449
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:24,721
The police have already investigated.

450
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:26,223
They investigated what they saw,

451
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,824
not what they didn't saw.

452
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:30,960
Talk to friends, classmates,
pizza delivery guy.

453
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,496
And draft foreman.

454
00:25:32,563 --> 00:25:33,863
He can make calls through his tears.

455
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,232
No.

456
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,267
Is that no, i'm not
calling my boyfriend,

457
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,468
who apparently called
my boss instead of me

458
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,936
to say he wasn't coming in?

459
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:41,238
'cause it's really not fair

460
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:43,039
to have that much
subtext in one syllable.

461
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:45,275
We all wanna know why kutner did it.

462
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:49,179
But we're not gonna
waste time chasing ghosts.

463
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:53,283
You're not remotely curious?

464
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,785
Only why a man who embraces the rational

465
00:25:55,853 --> 00:26:00,923
is suddenly pursuing the irrational.

466
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:04,127
She could have alpha-1
anti-trypsin deficiency.

467
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,164
Run her aat proteins.

468
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,337
I'd like to be with eddie.

469
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:16,739
It's too soon after your surgery.

470
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:19,142
You can ask that someone get your organs

471
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,743
if you die, right?

472
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:23,780
Even if the donor bank turned them down?

473
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:26,283
Individual donors can
bypass the registry,

474
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,219
but there are a lot of
other factors...blood type...

475
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,388
i've given him blood.

476
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:34,324
It's not just... please.

477
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:41,198
If i go before him, i want
you to give him my heart.

478
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:44,033
This isn't over yet.

479
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:49,673
For me. But it is for him, isn't it?

480
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,941
Yes.

481
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,681
Remy hadley. I also answer to thirteen.

482
00:26:57,748 --> 00:27:00,083
I sometimes sleep with you.

483
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,085
I know i should have called.

484
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,921
I just need some time.

485
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:08,157
Alone?

486
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,194
I've worked through a lot
of bad stuff in my life.

487
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,931
Always done it solo.

488
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:24,006
So i should go.

489
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:27,544
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,247
Okay.

491
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:44,794
I.t.'s been trying to close
out kutner's email account.

492
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:47,764
Apparently, someone's
still logged onto it.

493
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:51,434
It wasn't hard to figure out
that his password was kutner.

494
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:53,136
He did what they tell you not to.

495
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:55,305
He wasn't murdered.
But his parents were.

496
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,507
And the guy who killed them
is coming up for parole.

497
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,176
He's coming up for parole.
He's not out on parole.

498
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:03,713
Kutner testified at
every one of his hearings.

499
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:06,249
The guy wouldn't be the first
to see the clock ticking.

500
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,285
He was killed by his own gun.

501
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:10,920
Which he bought years ago,
obviously for self-defense.

502
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:13,055
In the temple. Cops found residue.

503
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:14,957
Right, the murderer would never try to

504
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:18,928
make it look like suicide...
that would be unethical.

505
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:24,334
You haven't asked about my patient.

506
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,670
You're waiting on aat protein results.

507
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:28,838
Means you checked up to
see that i'm still on it.

508
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:32,776
You wanna transfer the case,
but you won't because you think

509
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:35,345
it's the only thing
that's holding me together.

510
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,281
Relax. Either i'm right or i'm wrong.

511
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,982
We'll know soon enough.

512
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,552
Find what's killing your patient...

513
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,789
and then i'll find you another patient.

514
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,896
What happened? Nurses
found her like this.

515
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,163
She broke into the cart

516
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,032
and injected whatever she could grab.

517
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:56,500
Dumb way to look worse for eddie.

518
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,336
She wasn't trying to look worse.

519
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,006
She was trying to kill herself.

520
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,517
she's stable,

521
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:08,453
but whatever was left of her
liver is definitely shot now.

522
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,087
And there's no change in eddie.

523
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:12,923
So...thanks to her idiotic move,

524
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:16,060
she's dead in 24 hours if
she doesn't get a new liver.

525
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:18,429
It was selfless. She loves him.

526
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:20,431
How does that disagree
with what i just said?

527
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:22,300
Test was negative for aat deficiency.

528
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:24,101
Myelofibrosis fits,

529
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,103
but testing takes at least 48 hours.

530
00:29:26,172 --> 00:29:28,573
We should try a partial
donation from a live donor.

531
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,275
Damage is too severe. She
needs a whole new liver.

532
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:33,578
No diagnosis, no liver.
No liver, no living.

533
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,080
What do you know?

534
00:29:36,148 --> 00:29:39,083
It is myelofibrosis.

535
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:42,420
Says so right here.
Who wants to tell cuddy?

536
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,755
How many times have you lied
to the transplant committee?

537
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:46,891
Just twice. How many
times has it worked?

538
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:50,228
I...don't quite see how that's relevant.

539
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:56,100
Cheese it. It's the coppers.

540
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:57,935
We're not just gonna leave them to die

541
00:29:58,003 --> 00:29:59,370
while you fixate on kutner.

542
00:29:59,438 --> 00:30:01,573
Technically, he's not our patient.

543
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,974
So i'm really only leaving her to die.

544
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:05,776
We've already explored
the usual options.

545
00:30:05,844 --> 00:30:08,313
Shouldn't we at least
explore unusual ones?

546
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,147
Absolutely. Don't worry.

547
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:11,949
This is why god gave me two ears.

548
00:30:12,017 --> 00:30:15,353
Kutner would say we should
just come clean with cuddy.

549
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:19,757
If only he were here to say that.

550
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:22,627
I'm sure cuddy would be
bound to fall for the old,

551
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:26,264
"hey, the dead guy won't
mind if we're wasting... "

552
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:36,574
need an incurable romantic
to talk to incurable romantic.

553
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:38,175
Kutner wasn't murdered.

554
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:40,111
You deduce that by
removing your sunglasses

555
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:41,912
to the strains of a who song?

556
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,514
Suicide means you could have helped him.

557
00:30:43,582 --> 00:30:46,016
Murder lets you off the hook.

558
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:51,489
Needs a liver. Has a liver.

559
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:53,558
He can make a partial donation.

560
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:55,826
The faster he agrees,

561
00:30:55,894 --> 00:30:58,162
the faster she gets to not die.

562
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,298
Partial won't be enough.
She needs a whole liver.

563
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:04,201
And he'd never survive the procedure.

564
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,505
Nice symmetry, huh?

565
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:09,206
He dies on the table,

566
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:11,142
and you give her his whole liver.

567
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:14,979
If he's gonna do this,
he's gonna do this for love.

568
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:19,817
I thought he should talk to
someone who spoke the language.

569
00:31:19,885 --> 00:31:22,287
You want me to die on the table.

570
00:31:22,354 --> 00:31:26,957
We don't want you to.
Your wife needs you to.

571
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:29,093
My heart? Is still dying.

572
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:31,262
You have a couple days at most.

573
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,532
But this could buy us
enough time to save her.

574
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,702
When can i say good-bye?

575
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,704
You can't.

576
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:44,008
If she knew what we were
planning, would she be okay?

577
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:47,178
She'll resent me.

578
00:31:47,245 --> 00:31:50,047
She'll be alive. Nothing else matters.

579
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:14,838
You can't do the transplant.
Only if he said no.

580
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:16,840
But your urgent hovering
means he said yes.

581
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:18,475
His fingers have nodules.

582
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:20,311
I think his doctors misdiagnosed him.

583
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:22,813
Or you sprinkled too much
wishful thinking in your tea.

584
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,781
Obese man with lung cancer...

585
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:26,783
two easy explanations
for his heart failure.

586
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:29,019
Nodules can mean something
else, something curable.

587
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:30,720
Go back to the e.r.

588
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:32,689
My thanks to you and your cold feet.

589
00:32:32,757 --> 00:32:34,558
What's going on?

590
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,093
I'm giving you a shot
at a cool result...

591
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:38,062
better yet, a chance to
prove other doctors idiotic.

592
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:39,729
Except you're wrong.

593
00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:42,099
You figure that out by
taking off your sunglasses

594
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:44,734
to the strains of a who song?

595
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:47,037
The guy who killed kutner's parents

596
00:32:47,105 --> 00:32:49,273
died of an aneurism two months ago.

597
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:51,641
Kutner hid from everyone.

598
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:54,011
You didn't get a chance
to save him... no one did.

599
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,779
Run the tests.

600
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:59,316
Find out if you have
a chance to save eddie.

601
00:33:07,457 --> 00:33:09,793
Bad news.

602
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,195
Love can't save you.

603
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:17,233
On the other hand...

604
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:19,335
mold can.

605
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:22,638
Your heart failure was
caused by a fungal infection

606
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:25,241
called cardiac blastomycosis.

607
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:27,577
It started as nodules in your lungs

608
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:31,047
which every doc, except
one, mistook for cancer.

609
00:33:31,115 --> 00:33:33,149
It's very rare, very curable.

610
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:35,118
I'm starting you on itraconazole.

611
00:33:35,186 --> 00:33:37,520
But how come i was getting
better without the medicine?

612
00:33:37,588 --> 00:33:40,123
Your emotional state
bumped your catecholamines

613
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:41,657
which helped raise your prolactin.

614
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:42,792
My emotional state?

615
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,527
Three months of treatment,

616
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:47,663
you'll be back to your
buff, chiseled self.

617
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:51,134
I don't want the treatment.

618
00:33:51,202 --> 00:33:53,236
Do the transplant.

619
00:33:53,303 --> 00:33:56,072
But you'd be trading...

620
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,908
the certainty that you'll live

621
00:33:58,976 --> 00:34:00,777
for the uncertainty that she'll live.

622
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:03,579
I was ready to die anyway.

623
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:07,617
Now you get to be
nicer to your next wife.

624
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:13,422
If you won't do it... release me.

625
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,692
And when i get hit by a car

626
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:20,730
and show up in your morgue,

627
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:24,700
you can give her my liver then.

628
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:29,813
you're basically asking
us to commit murder.

629
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,414
I was yesterday too.

630
00:34:31,482 --> 00:34:33,683
There's a difference when
he has 20 years to live

631
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:35,284
instead of two days.

632
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:36,919
Not really. Not legally.

633
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,955
That's your way of
convincing us to do this,

634
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:40,724
by saying it's no more immoral?

635
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,759
The idiot is gonna do
this with or without us.

636
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,361
This way we can protect the organ.

637
00:34:44,428 --> 00:34:46,028
We should be protecting him.

638
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:49,031
So we strap him to the bed,
wait till his wife dies?

639
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:52,101
I'm not doing this.

640
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:58,842
I will.

641
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:02,645
We've already had one pointless death.

642
00:35:06,283 --> 00:35:09,586
Eddie...what's going on?

643
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:13,356
I don't know. He just came and got me.

644
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:15,892
Your husband has a curable disease,

645
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,194
but he wants to die so
he can give you his liver.

646
00:35:18,262 --> 00:35:19,529
Are you okay with that,

647
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:21,197
or would you rather
he take the treatment?

648
00:35:21,265 --> 00:35:23,433
You son of a bitch! Eddie, don't!

649
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:27,404
You have to let me do this.
Charlotte, can you hear me?

650
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:30,740
She spiked a fever.

651
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:32,742
Lp shows her white
cells through the roof.

652
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,878
She's infected everywhere.
I should fire you.

653
00:35:34,945 --> 00:35:36,513
Just did what you failed to do...

654
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,081
convince eddie to live
and let his wife die.

655
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:41,217
Infection means we have a new clue.

656
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:43,753
And a full two or three
hours to figure it out.

657
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:45,488
Sarcoidosis hits the
spleen and the liver.

658
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:46,756
She would have lung issues.

659
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:48,157
Scleroderma inflames the tissue.

660
00:35:48,225 --> 00:35:50,192
No skin or gi problems.

661
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,395
What is she hiding?

662
00:35:52,463 --> 00:35:53,963
You don't know...

663
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:56,198
either we have all the
clues and we're idiots

664
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,534
or we don't have all the clues.

665
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:02,104
Possible exposure, people, places.

666
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:03,840
Both.

667
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:08,912
Bad lie.

668
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:11,414
Did you really think
the beaches in hawaii

669
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:13,483
were just like the beaches in rio?

670
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:16,719
The disease bearing sand
flies are completely different.

671
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:19,689
She's never been to
rio. Who'd you go with?

672
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:22,992
Why are you doing this?

673
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,227
I don't actually need
to know who it was.

674
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:27,997
I just need to know that you went...

675
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:31,734
so we can know that you
have visceral leishmaniasis.

676
00:36:31,802 --> 00:36:35,171
But since lancelot there
was ready to die for you...

677
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:38,842
he might want the answer to both.

678
00:36:47,184 --> 00:36:50,453
Last year...

679
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:54,457
it was nobody you knew.

680
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:58,060
Rio was supposed to be ours.

681
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:02,131
I got tired of waiting.

682
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:06,636
I'm so sorry.

683
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:18,815
Start her on antimony.

684
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:21,651
And have cuddy find her a liver.

685
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:26,689
They were ready to die...

686
00:37:26,757 --> 00:37:28,925
but for guilt, not love.

687
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:32,762
You can't feel that
much guilt without love.

688
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:41,538
New york mercy's medevacing the liver.

689
00:37:41,605 --> 00:37:42,972
It should be here...

690
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,807
tell 'em to turn around.

691
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,276
Charlotte's treatment isn't taking.

692
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:50,813
We diagnosed it too late.

693
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,086
Everyone's heading over
to kutner's funeral.

694
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:58,888
You're welcome to ride with me.

695
00:37:58,956 --> 00:38:01,724
I'm gonna stay with charlotte.

696
00:38:03,894 --> 00:38:06,162
She bought you some time to save eddie.

697
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:08,932
It'll give her death some meaning.

698
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:12,501
No. It won't.

699
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,878
I was wrong about you. No, you weren't.

700
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:23,713
You're in pain.

701
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:26,215
And you're romanticizing... again.

702
00:38:26,283 --> 00:38:28,785
You worked with him
every day for two years,

703
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:30,219
and you never saw this coming.

704
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:31,788
No one saw it coming.

705
00:38:31,855 --> 00:38:33,856
But you see everything coming.

706
00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:35,825
This has never been
about what you missed.

707
00:38:35,893 --> 00:38:37,794
This is about why you missed it.

708
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:40,529
You're terrified that
you're losing your gift,

709
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:44,233
losing...who you are.

710
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:48,938
And i'm terrified of what you'd do then.

711
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:51,340
Unless you feel there's
more to do here to cure me...

712
00:38:51,408 --> 00:38:54,477
don't you have a funeral to go to?

713
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:32,148
I'm taking a ride ?

714
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:35,151
Off to one side ?

715
00:39:35,218 --> 00:39:39,488
It is a personal thing ?

716
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:43,626
Where when i can't stand ?

717
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:50,833
Up in this cage i'm not regretting ?

718
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:57,674
I don't need a better thing ?

719
00:39:57,741 --> 00:40:02,378
I'll settle for less ?

720
00:40:02,445 --> 00:40:08,017
It's another thing for me ?

721
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:16,358
I just have to wander
through this world ?

722
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:19,361
Alone ?

723
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:44,053
Stop before you fall ?

724
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:51,227
Into the hole that i have dug here ?

725
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:55,564
Rest, even as you ?

726
00:40:55,632 --> 00:41:03,072
Are startin' to feel the way i used to ?

727
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:08,711
I don't need a better thing ?

728
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:15,017
Just to sound confused ?

729
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:20,422
Don't talk about everyone ?

730
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:29,899
I am not amused by you ?

731
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:35,772

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:41,410
