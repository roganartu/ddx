1
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:23,609
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,655
Jeff.

3
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,985
Damn it. This is the last time
i'm turning around.

4
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,363
Next time you forget something,
you're gonna be on your own.

5
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,232
I can't play without a stick.

6
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:16,909
- Then I guess you won't play.
- I don't care.

7
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:18,323
I suck anyway.

8
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:21,366
- Don't say that.
- I'm the worst guy on the whole team.

9
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:23,391
- No, you're not.
- Then who's worse?

10
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,044
Don't worry about anyone else.
Just do your best.

11
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:27,920
See?
You can't name anyone.

12
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,333
Zach, stop it.

13
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:30,924
Then name someone.

14
00:01:32,702 --> 00:01:34,385
You can't, can you?

15
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,330
You really think I'm better
than those guys?

16
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:45,312
Yes.

17
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,938
Hurry up and get your stick.

18
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:12,965
Zach, get back in the car.

19
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:15,676
I need an ambulance
at 860 Oakwood avenue!

20
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:18,512
- Why is dad's car on?
- Get back in the car, Zach!

21
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:29,240
Come on!

22
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:34,361
Don't do this to me, Jeff!
Don't do this!

23
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:51,879
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:54,172
I just...

25
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,318
I couldn't take the pain anymore.

26
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,684
House - Season 05 Episode 12
"Painless"

27
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:12,676
Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak

28
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:31,085
www.house-fr.com

29
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,301
Either I need a new watch,

30
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:13,006
or mowgli is cutting
into your beauty sleep.

31
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,611
I was up all night
looking at finance reports,

32
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,407
and Rachel is doing great.
Thanks for asking.

33
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,352
Proving that you'rea better foster mom
than a homeless drug addict.

34
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:25,139
Departmental budgets
are due this week.

35
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:26,853
I'm gonna need an extension.

36
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:29,727
- Got some time next decade.
- Cameron already turned yours in.

37
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,689
That's nice of her.
Two questions:

38
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:36,077
why did she?
And why are you telling me?

39
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,193
Same answer.
Now you owe her a favor.

40
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:41,697
I'm gonna need an extension.
I got some time...

41
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:44,103
I've got a d. y. f. s.
home visit on friday.

42
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:46,123
And I've got a w-h-o-r-e visit on...

43
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:47,328
Mama's busy.

44
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,001
You two are gonna have to go
play outside for a while.

45
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:58,456
32-year-old male
with chronic pain all over.

46
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,112
This is the favor?

47
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:03,928
I was expecting something involving
whipped cream and tongue depressors.

48
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:06,381
He's seen 7 different
specialists over 3 years.

49
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,958
No diagnosis and no relief.

50
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,809
Oh, I am fascinated already.
It's like I'm treating myself.

51
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:14,611
He gets cured; I get to learn a valuable
lesson about the milk of human kindness.

52
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:16,941
If I thought you learned lessons,
I never would've quit.

53
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,985
- So you're wasting a favor because?
- I think you can help this guy.

54
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:22,870
Drug-seeking patients...

55
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:26,032
Don't attempt suicide with medicine
cabinets full of narcotics.

56
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:29,620
- Sounds like fibromyalgia.
- Sounds like you don't work for house.

57
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,645
Diagnosis that provides neither
an explanation

58
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,714
nor a cure is not a diagnosis.

59
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,004
American college
of rheumatology would disagree.

60
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,951
- There are specific criteria.
- Which this guy doesn't meet.

61
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:42,468
Putting pressure on his pain
helps, doesn't make it worse.

62
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,483
He's got abdominal pain,
severe headaches,

63
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:46,164
muscle cramps that come and go.

64
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,430
He tried to off himself.
He's mentally ill.

65
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,131
- Pain's probably psychological.
- It is not a sign of mental illness

66
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,518
to want to be pain-free.

67
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,636
It is if your solution
is sucking on a tailpipe.

68
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,474
Sane people don't attempt suicide.

69
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,788
Not ever?

70
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,787
So if you were being burnt at the stake
and someone handed you a gun...

71
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,424
I'd shoot the guys with the torches.

72
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:07,516
Not one doctor this guy has
seen in the past 3 years

73
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,482
has been able to find
what's wrong with him.

74
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:11,787
- What does that tell you?
- It means they're idiots.

75
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:14,079
It means
we got to start from the beginning.

76
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:16,583
We'll do a pain profile to rule out
psychosomatic pain,

77
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:18,585
search the home.

78
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:19,826
Go home.

79
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:21,416
Get a refill...

80
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,495
And a doughnut.

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,760
I'll help with the home.

82
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,672
"Choose a statement in each group
that best describes

83
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:44,159
how you've been feeling lately,
including today."

84
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:45,790
I'm not depressed.

85
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,490
I know what I did was stupid.

86
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:51,368
"I usually sleep well.

87
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:54,638
"I have some trouble with sleep.
I have a lot of trouble with sleep."

88
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:56,992
I have a lot of trouble.

89
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,873
It's up and down.

90
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:00,566
Between the pain and the meds,

91
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:02,379
his sleep pattern's pretty erratic.

92
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,897
"He's a calm person.

93
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:07,051
"He's more nervous than most people.
He's so nervous, he's miserable."

94
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,656
He's definitely calm.

95
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:11,889
Sometimes calmer
the worse the pain gets.

96
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:17,102
I think talking, interacting
with other people makes it worse.

97
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:20,097
- Interesting.
- Why? Does that mean something?

98
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:21,616
No, it's just...

99
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,161
we've seen that in other...

100
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:26,111
patients.

101
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:30,039
"He can do chores around the house.
With help, he can do chores.

102
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:32,105
He can no longer do chores."

103
00:07:32,394 --> 00:07:33,875
He helps all the time.

104
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,121
He's really strong.

105
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:37,923
He used to play hockey.

106
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,666
And he was really good too.

107
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:42,724
"I believe there's hope.

108
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,748
"Hoping for things to get better
is a struggle for me.

109
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:48,634
Most of the time,
I feel completely hopeless."

110
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:50,425
He still laughs...

111
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,214
All the time.

112
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,373
He was always optimistic.

113
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,201
He still is. It's just...

114
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:58,644
It's harder now.

115
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:00,936
I guess...

116
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,994
I pray for strength more than hope.

117
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,990
There's nothing in there but
a pharmacy's worth of pain meds.

118
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:14,785
This guy makes House
look like a Christian scientist.

119
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,070
He's also more compliant than House.

120
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,611
Kept all the inserts, had daily

121
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:20,833
pill dispensers to make sure
he didn't mix them up.

122
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:24,670
I guess if you're gonna go out in a car,
this ain't a bad one to choose.

123
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:27,923
If I ever did it,
definitely wouldn't be like that.

124
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:31,195
Don't worry.
I'm not making any plans.

125
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,764
I certainly wouldn't know.

126
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:34,794
Ever since we kissed,
you've been avoiding me.

127
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,114
- No, I haven't.
- Just been busy.

128
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:41,135
Metal polish could cause nerve damage
if he inhaled enough of it.

129
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,638
Judging by the shine on that car,
he used a fair amount.

130
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:47,109
Judging by the fact that he owns
a body shop and one of these,

131
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,255
i'd say he knew not to inhale.

132
00:08:50,638 --> 00:08:52,489
Busy tonight?
We can get some dinner.

133
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,556
I don't think so.

134
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:58,193
So making out, okay.
Meals, too intimate?

135
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:00,539
I don't want to kiss you
again either.

136
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:03,375
- Why? Because we work together?
- No.

137
00:09:04,182 --> 00:09:05,692
Because I like you.

138
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,832
- That makes a lot of sense.
- What doesn't make sense

139
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:11,466
is me getting involved with anyone.

140
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:15,304
I thought you'd gotten past that.
That's why you agreed to the drug trial.

141
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,267
- You can't give up on life because...
- I'm not giving up on life.

142
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:20,559
I'm just giving up on you.

143
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,331
I finally feel like I have a grip
on things.

144
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:24,772
I can handle this.

145
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:28,157
What I can't handle is dragging
anyone else down with me.

146
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:35,115
Does this look like quail to you?

147
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:40,643
You think he's had food poisoning
every day for the last three years?

148
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:42,164
Wild quail can be toxic,

149
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,582
cause rhabdomyolysis,

150
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,212
which would explain his pain,
as well as the elevated C.K. levels.

151
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,622
So would the carbon monoxide
he sucked out of his car.

152
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:52,060
It's not a toxic reaction.
It's a psychosomatic reaction.

153
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,552
The pain profile showed an excessive
concern about his physical health,

154
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:57,471
difficulty sleeping,
getting out of bed.

155
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,884
He's not in pain because he's depressed.
He's depressed because he's in pain.

156
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,041
Not according
to the pain profile you ordered.

157
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,479
It's not a diet issue. We should
start him on antidepressants

158
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,522
for his sake,
as well as his family's.

159
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,943
- We're not diagnosing his family.
- We're not diagnosing you either.

160
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,650
It's rhabdo.
Push I. V. fluids,

161
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:17,481
check his urine, do a muscle biopsy.

162
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:19,910
What muscle?
He says it hurts all over.

163
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:21,954
Then she'll biopsy all over.

164
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,206
- Where are you going?
- If Cuddy can come in late,

165
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:27,508
I can leave early.

166
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:30,712
If you need anything while I'm gone,
just ask Cameron to do it.

167
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,050
So if he just stops eating quail,

168
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,438
the pain will go away?

169
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:39,008
If we're right,
it's definitely treatable.

170
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,557
My arm!
It's starting to...

171
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:44,377
He needs more medicine.

172
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:46,938
B.P. is down. We need to get him
in trendelenburg position.

173
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,789
- Can you hear me?!
- He's arresting.

174
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,924
We need a crash cart in here!

175
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,786
He's not answering his cell either.

176
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:26,268
V.Q. scan showed
a pulmonary embolism.

177
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,461
Means the pain's not psychosomatic.

178
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:30,552
It also means it's not
rhabdomyolysis.

179
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:33,716
Untill now, his heart and lungs were
the only places he didn't have pain.

180
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:35,235
Means it's getting worse.

181
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:40,144
Got to let the phone ring
more than four times

182
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,809
when you're calling a cripple.

183
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,677
- Chronic pain, pulmonary embolism go.
- How'd you know...

184
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:47,164
You called after midnight.
It's got to be a heart problem.

185
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:49,082
Heart only would be consistent with

186
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:50,876
Rhabdo, which means 13 and Foreman

187
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,920
would be singing in the rain,
which means it has to be lungs as well.

188
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:56,214
Hypercoagulable state
could cause pain and A.P.E.

189
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:59,662
You think the blood clot was caused by
a clotting problem, that's helpful.

190
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,901
What if it's a cancer syndrome,
like Trousseau's?

191
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:05,119
Explains blood clots, multifocal pain,
lack of obvious physical signs.

192
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:07,392
And why he's gone three years
without anyone seeing it.

193
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,557
Check his chest, abdomen,
and pelvis for tumors.

194
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:15,368
Why did he think only you two
would be singing in the rain?

195
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:17,045
Bone windows are normal.

196
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,469
Checking for cancerous masses
in the lungs.

197
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,219
So, who do you know
who committed suicide?

198
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,972
Hemingway, Goebbels,

199
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,057
- Rromeo and Juliet.
- Your mom?

200
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:30,176
Dad?

201
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,184
Saying I wouldn't do it
under any circumstances

202
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:33,995
means my whole family was suicidal?

203
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,815
No, but categorically insisting
there are no circumstances,

204
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,197
means you've got baggage,
personal betrayal, abandonment.

205
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:43,029
Just because you grew up
in a Charles Dickens novel...

206
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:44,821
It's people like me who don't do it.

207
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:47,576
When your life sucks from the beginning,
there's nowhere to go but up.

208
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:51,163
Thorax is clear.
No tumors in the lungs.

209
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,920
The only betrayal comes from
father of the year in there.

210
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:57,085
He has a wife, a kid. People
who count on him to have a pulse.

211
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,711
Okay.

212
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,686
Switching to high-res cuts
of the abdomen.

213
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,630
My parents
live very happily in queens.

214
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:07,423
They never attempted, thought about,
or attempted to think about committ...

215
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:09,514
- What?
- There,

216
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:11,856
along his diaphragm.

217
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,254
That's not cancer.

218
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:23,306
No hurry.
I already bathed once this week.

219
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:24,905
I wouldn't want to look elitist.

220
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,394
Can't do anything
till I write up an estimate.

221
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:32,162
Fine.
Pad it all you want.

222
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,937
Here's a check for the deductible.

223
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:36,052
Don't touch the piano
and lock up when you leave.

224
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:38,727
Sorry, deductible
doesn't apply here.

225
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,466
I'm no architect, but

226
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,778
I'm pretty sure the master
bedroom is part of the home,

227
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:46,426
- which means the home warranty...
- Doesn't cover negligence.

228
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:48,969
This pipe goes through the ceiling,

229
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:51,252
over that wall,
and into your shower.

230
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:53,826
It didn't burst.
It was pulled apart.

231
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,204
Yeah, 'cause I'm clearly a guy
who likes to knock out

232
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,356
a few naked pull-ups
before I greet the day.

233
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:02,526
- You hang laundry in there?
- I'm about to hang a plumber in there.

234
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:05,070
Look, there's no rust.

235
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:06,796
There's no corrosion.

236
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:09,033
I don't know how it happened,
but I know what happened,

237
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,535
and it's not covered. So...

238
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:15,789
Whenever you're ready to spend
the $2,200, give somebody else a call.

239
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:30,009
I promise, i'm only holding your hand
to check for choreiform movement.

240
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,345
I'm getting absolutely
no intimacy from it.

241
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,535
I told you, it has nothing
to do with you.

242
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,162
I know. That's the problem.

243
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:39,854
There's 80 reasons we shouldn't date,
but you can't shut everyone out.

244
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,065
You're gonna need help, support.

245
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,244
Look at our patient.
32 years old, not dead yet,

246
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:48,098
and already he's traumatized
his wife, his son...

247
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,601
I'll bet they're cherishing every
traumatic minute he has left,

248
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:52,979
wouldn't trade him for
the healthiest guy in the world.

249
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:53,937
True.

250
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:57,270
And they're stuck suffering
with him, hating every day.

251
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:59,759
Only their pain has no prospect
of relief.

252
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:02,379
- This a bad time?
- No. Yeah.

253
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,171
No trace of cancer.

254
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:08,722
But we did find edema in his intestines,
air in the intestinal blood vessels,

255
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:11,426
- and House won't answer his phone.
- His intestine must be damaged.

256
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,746
- The air's leaking into his body.
- if there's a blockage

257
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:16,752
in the superior mesenteric, it could be
choking off blood flow to his intestine.

258
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,997
Blockages all over his body
would explain his pain,

259
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:20,549
why the cramps come and go.

260
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,039
Do an angioplasty
on the superior mesenteric

261
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:25,847
and find the other blockages
before he has another cardiac arrest.

262
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:26,973
I'll help.

263
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,518
Good thing we don't have
a suicidal patient

264
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:45,504
with a horrific,
undiagnosed pain disorder.

265
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,654
We did till we diagnosed it.

266
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:50,323
We found intestinal edema
and air in the blood vessels.

267
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,378
- Pain was vascular.
- If it was vascular,

268
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:53,942
we would've seen uneven pulses.

269
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,681
His blood pressure was uneven.
13 and Kutner are doing an angio.

270
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:58,767
He had hemorrhages in his fingers.

271
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,587
There's air in the intestine.
It has to have come from somewhere.

272
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,783
Yes...

273
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,090
It does.

274
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,070
After we thread the catheter
through his groin and into position,

275
00:17:13,195 --> 00:17:14,931
the blood will start
flowing freely again.

276
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:16,541
Will that take away the pain?

277
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,620
It will be completely ineffective,

278
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,914
and the pain
will completely go away.

279
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:23,523
- Cancel the angio.
- He has air in his blood vessels.

280
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:26,706
- If we don't open the artery to his...
- Where can air come from?

281
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:31,177
Air can either com
from a breach in the lumen

282
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:33,851
in the small intestine,
or in rare instaes,

283
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:36,813
air can come from the air.

284
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,183
Teeth marks.

285
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:43,107
I'm guessing from when he blew
into his i. v. tube.

286
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:45,394
Air bubble caused the P.E.
and cardiac arrest.

287
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,085
You tried to finish the job
that you started at home.

288
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:51,834
Why?

289
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:53,937
I lied.

290
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,886
I want to die.

291
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:05,333
Please just let me die.

292
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:09,003
No.

293
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,258
He's in a hyperbaric chamber.

294
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:22,816
A dose of high pressure
ought to chase the air out of his blood.

295
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:26,438
Is anyone keeping an eye on him,
because, the whole idea of suicide

296
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:30,275
watch was specifically
created for suicidal patients.

297
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,047
I realize how you might've
thought the name was just a coincidence.

298
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:36,302
Are there any visuals in this room
that are key to us learng our lesson?

299
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:38,250
'cause the telephone...

300
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,324
I'm inconveniencing you
because you inconvenienced me.

301
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,630
- When was the last time you showered?
- Scent of a man...

302
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,732
I realize you
haven't experienced it sober.

303
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:51,461
If anyone should be able to handle
a depressed pain patient...

304
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:54,299
- He insisted he was no longer...
- Apparently he lied.

305
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:57,523
Didn't think I'd have to remind you
of that remote possibility.

306
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,263
I have a d. y. f. s. inspection
in less than 24 hours,

307
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,766
- so if you can't control...
- Non-motor seizures.

308
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:05,935
Sorry, I was thinking
about the patient.

309
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:07,548
What were you saying?

310
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:11,431
The pain started in his abdomen
near his intestine.

311
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:14,544
- The first symptom has got to be key.
- He's had multiple eegs,

312
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:18,190
all of them cleaner and squeakier
than Cuddy's rubber nipples.

313
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,950
What about a glycogen storage
disease like Mcardle's?

314
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,392
It explains the pain.

315
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:25,392
There's plenty of muscle cells
in the wall of the intestine.

316
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:28,583
Fourteen is right.

317
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,419
Go run an ischemic forearm test.

318
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,908
Take the garbage out
on your way out.

319
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:40,542
If you want a man to take your crap,
you have to marry him first.

320
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,119
Or employ him.

321
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,834
Good girl.

322
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:50,928
I don't think I'm ready to run
a decathlon yet.

323
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:54,295
If we can get you managing your life
a bit better, that'll be plenty.

324
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,319
Dr. Hadley, whenever you're ready.

325
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:00,296
You look better.

326
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:03,284
Yeah, they said my basal
ganglian volume has improved.

327
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,410
All I know is for the first time
in 2 years,

328
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:08,681
I can drink a cup of water
without spilling it all over myself.

329
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:12,168
Thank you for getting
me back in the study.

330
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,851
I haven't even seen you in weeks.

331
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,870
I didn't even know our appointments
were back-to-back again.

332
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:19,228
Well, they weren't.

333
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:21,010
Mine got switched this morning.

334
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:24,892
We're gonna take
your blood repeatedly.

335
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,159
If the increased train makes
your arm hurt more,

336
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:30,311
- you have a muscle abnormality.
- If you're right about this...

337
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:33,731
Mcardle's disease,
can you take away the pain?

338
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,902
With gene-replacement therapy, with
lifestyle changes, we can reduce it.

339
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:38,820
Keep squeezing the ball.

340
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,244
- How long does he have to...
- You should get something to eat.

341
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:45,397
- Don't worry about us.
- I'm not.

342
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:49,163
- Please get out of here.
- These tests are all I can handle.

343
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:57,505
- They're trying to help you.
- They can't.

344
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,366
Then how about helping them,

345
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,509
- you know, by not being...
- An ass?

346
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,513
You have no idea what
I'm going through.

347
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,014
I know it's better than what
you tried to go through.

348
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,783
Sure, no baggage at all.

349
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:13,104
- Where's the pain worst right now?
- Left arm.

350
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:14,844
- Does it hurt more?
- Couldn't.

351
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,755
And lactate level is steady.
It's not any kind of glycogen.

352
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:20,612
Oh, god!
Pain jumped to my leg!

353
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,313
That's never happened before...

354
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:24,490
Your chest, your abdomen...
You feel anything there?

355
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,705
My leg!

356
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,387
It feels like it's being sawed off.

357
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:34,453
Nice.

358
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:35,335
What?

359
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,882
Switching janice's appointment time
so I could see the skies

360
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,157
- brighten like a lifetime tv movie.
- I don't know...

361
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:43,081
Sticking your most improved
study participant in my face.

362
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:45,210
Is that your way of
getting into my pants?

363
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,782
I don't make the schedule, and...

364
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,562
if I did, I wouldn't use it
as a social lubricant.

365
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:53,937
And this is the first I've heard
of janice improving at all.

366
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:56,858
So, hey, thanks for the good news.

367
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,248
Pain started in his abdomen.

368
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:07,385
It's hopped from his left thumb
to his left leg,

369
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,328
- skipping the trunk entirely.
- I need the name of a good lawyer.

370
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,977
- We're getting sued?
- Probably. That's Cuddy's problem.

371
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:15,750
Hopping pain, means it's something
in his brain, not his body.

372
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,602
Except the pain's in two places

373
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:19,918
that connect to two separate
regions of the brain,

374
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:21,547
which means you're not using yours.

375
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,796
Come on,
you're from one of the 12 tribes.

376
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:26,540
You know must know
a ton of shysters.

377
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,150
What type of lawyer do you need?

378
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:30,767
I'll bring it up at the next world
domination subcommittee meeting.

379
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,643
Didn't say I needed a lawyer.
I said I needed the name of a lawyer.

380
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:36,688
Pain hopped to another
limb on the same side.

381
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,788
- It's gotta be central...
- Could be peripheral.

382
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:40,984
- If multiple areas of disc disease
- Were consistent

383
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,152
Were consistent with
a completely spotless mri.

384
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,853
Who represented the hospital when
you set that patient on fire?

385
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:47,949
Chris carrick.

386
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:49,632
Chris?

387
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,818
That doesn't sound
like a very good lawyer.

388
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:53,913
If we can't even resolve
body versus brain,

389
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,639
- we're never gonna diagnose the guy.
- What was the name of the firm?

390
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:57,876
Caddell and carrick.

391
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:01,065
It's not like we can chop off his
head to see if the pain goes away.

392
00:23:04,193 --> 00:23:05,174
Why not?

393
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:18,349
Need to cut off a guy's head.

394
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,542
Got to figure out if his pain's
coming from his brain or his body.

395
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,443
A stiff shot of lidocaine below
the brain stem

396
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:27,590
should numb him all the way down
to his tippy toes.

397
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:29,910
Hearing me say "no" over
the phone wasn't good enough?

398
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,910
I'm inconveniencing you
because you inconvenienced me.

399
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:35,620
That foster-care official
is coming in the morning.

400
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:37,614
If they weren't,
there'd be no inconvenience.

401
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:40,042
Do not try and force me to
choose between my child...

402
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:42,211
I'm forcing you to do your job!

403
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:46,007
- If you can't also...
- Fine,

404
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,635
you want to separate a patient's central
nervous system from his body.

405
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:52,555
If the pain stays, it's in his brain.
If it vanishes...

406
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,515
What about options three,
four, and five?

407
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:57,643
His respiratory system freezes,
he dies of infection, or he leaks fluid

408
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,007
like a firhydrant, which would
make him wish he were dead?

409
00:24:00,132 --> 00:24:02,231
You need to scratch option five.
He's already there.

410
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:06,297
You preach objectivity, but as soon as
a patient comes in in pain,

411
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:08,174
all you want to do is look
under the hood.

412
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:10,696
You don't care if there's
a one-in-three chance you'll kill him.

413
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:13,868
If I don't diagnose him, there's
a one-in-one chance he'll kill himself.

414
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,124
I got to go.

415
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:25,280
Do whatever it is
you think is right.

416
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:46,526
Tammy, you said you were
gonna be a little late.

417
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,996
DYFS. is gonna be here in an hour,
and this place is a disaster.

418
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:55,863
Never mind.

419
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,507
This should numb everything
from your shoulders down.

420
00:25:03,008 --> 00:25:05,614
Any pain that's
peripheral should be gone.

421
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:10,174
- What are you doing here?
- Just stretching my leg.

422
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:11,824
Carry on.

423
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:16,224
Bad pain day today?

424
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,493
About to get better.

425
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,620
Don't worry.
He's making yours a double.

426
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:25,474
I remember when the drugs
still made things tolerable.

427
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:28,724
I still thought
I had good days left.

428
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:31,279
Turns out you have
to live to find out.

429
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:35,109
- You don't have a family, do you?
- Left them all back on krypton.

430
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,981
You're alone.

431
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:40,449
That's why you can handle your pain.

432
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:42,325
No need to put up a front,

433
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,625
to be what anyone else
wants you to be.

434
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,045
You're having more bad days lately,
aren't you?

435
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,299
Yes.

436
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,639
Take a look at your future.

437
00:25:53,764 --> 00:25:55,928
Let's hope the drugs work this time.

438
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:11,013
I really wasn't
expecting you till later.

439
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:14,201
Had a cancellation, so I thought
i'd knock you off the docket.

440
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:17,452
I'm sorry this place is such a mess.
It's been a difficult work week.

441
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,619
- Any guns in the house?
- No.

442
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:22,515
Pets?

443
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:24,721
Besides the ants?

444
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:25,682
No.

445
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,624
Nice bag.

446
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,657
- Pricey way to ditch the diapers.
- That's not what I usually...

447
00:26:36,782 --> 00:26:38,346
I sort of panicked.

448
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:41,127
Mr. Carlton, if you'd just
give me a minute to explain.

449
00:26:41,252 --> 00:26:42,775
Everything looks fine.

450
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:44,298
Really?

451
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,771
Dr. Cuddy,
you've got sufficient income,

452
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,482
a high degree of personal
and professional stability,

453
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,444
and you care enough to be embarrassed
by what a mess this place is.

454
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,673
Believe me, that puts you
head and shoulders

455
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:57,799
above most of
the foster moms I visit.

456
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:00,508
See you next year,
if you haven't adopted her by then.

457
00:27:07,786 --> 00:27:08,860
My legs...

458
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,492
They're different.
Better.

459
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:14,048
- No pain at all?
- No, but less.

460
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:15,910
Four out of ten, maybe five.

461
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,220
Can't be.

462
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:23,208
If whatever is causing the pain is
in your brain, it's still a ten.

463
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,393
Periphery is zero.

464
00:27:26,223 --> 00:27:27,174
It is.

465
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:30,210
Some of the pain is gone,
but not all of it.

466
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:32,949
What does this mean?

467
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:38,489
Maybe Taub was right.

468
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,861
It's psychosomatic after all.

469
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:43,805
Which one of you is house?

470
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:46,349
The big black guy.

471
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,363
Chris carrick.

472
00:27:51,488 --> 00:27:53,708
Next time you use my name
in a threatening e-mail,

473
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,382
it won't be just a bill.
It'll be a lawsuit.

474
00:28:02,857 --> 00:28:04,113
Can you blame me?

475
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:06,484
The last time that happened,
the guy shot me.

476
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:09,177
What if the spinal block triggered
some sort of placebo effect?

477
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:12,313
Guy's taken the finest
opiates blue cross can buy.

478
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:14,650
How come they didn't
trigger a placebo effect?

479
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:25,867
What happened?!

480
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:27,982
He just started screaming,
do something!

481
00:28:31,364 --> 00:28:34,141
Please, god,
do not let it be what his father has.

482
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:39,911
I think he's faking.

483
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:41,989
How dare you?!

484
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:44,816
- What makes you think...
- House, the kid's in excruciating...

485
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,560
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

486
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:57,651
His idiot son
distracted the orderlies

487
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,806
so that daddy death wish here could
down a bottle of isopropyl.

488
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:03,449
Get him on dialysis,
or in half an hour, he'll be a corpse.

489
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:09,293
- You're hurting me.
- Remember the feeling.

490
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:11,999
Maybe next time you want to help pops,
you'll do a better acting job.

491
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:15,607
- You can't help him.
- Zach, why did you do this?

492
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:19,307
Because he's not dad anymore.

493
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,009
He just wants it to be over with.

494
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:24,437
Please.

495
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,466
Please, just...
Just let him die.

496
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,039
Fabry disease might be able to
cause central and peripheral pain.

497
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:55,096
- No angiokeratomata.
- Lightning pain from syphilis.

498
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:57,153
All the syph tests were negative.

499
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:02,049
- Why aren't you guys still talking?
- Because we ran out of ideas.

500
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,163
- Nothing explains this.
- Something has to.

501
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:10,346
Unless...

502
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:13,003
Nothing does.

503
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:14,485
So now you think...

504
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,735
Mine's a more interesting
version of nothing.

505
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,566
It used to be something.

506
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:22,027
We can't find anything because whatever
injury caused the original pain

507
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:23,806
healed a long time ago.

508
00:30:24,675 --> 00:30:26,443
The only thing left...

509
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:27,867
is the drugs.

510
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:30,736
Opioid induced pain.

511
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:32,873
Pain and the drugs that treat pain

512
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,444
work by changing brain chemistry,
sometimes to the point where

513
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:39,092
pain receptors
read painkillers as killer pain.

514
00:30:40,227 --> 00:30:41,647
Take him off the drugs.

515
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,175
We can't cure him,
so we're gonna torture him?

516
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,843
Torture is the cure.

517
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,862
Eventually his body
will recalibrate itself.

518
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:49,426
- Assuming you're right.
- Yes.

519
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,310
I find it confusing
to assume otherwise.

520
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,434
How would you like to
stop taking vicodin?

521
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:56,604
Good thing i'm not the patient.

522
00:31:01,114 --> 00:31:02,433
It's open.

523
00:31:09,781 --> 00:31:11,316
- Thank you.
- Is it too big?

524
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:14,449
She'll grow into it.
You can put it there.

525
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:19,717
I take it the home
inspection was pushed back.

526
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:21,322
I passed.

527
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:25,883
You do realize that's a good thing?

528
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,812
This place was a disaster.

529
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:31,514
I had to stash a dirty
diaper in my briefcase.

530
00:31:32,013 --> 00:31:33,432
So you buy another briefcase.

531
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:35,251
I let house supervise himself.

532
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:38,398
That's like handing a 12-year-old the
keys to the liquor cabinet and the car.

533
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,023
You passed the inspection.

534
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,497
The patient lived.

535
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:43,071
The car is still in the driveway.

536
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:46,695
And the next time my nanny gets sick
when house wants to saw someone in half?

537
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:49,823
Did I mention you
passed the inspection?

538
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,494
I passed by their meager standard.

539
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:55,257
I failed by mine.

540
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:57,996
Why do women always do that?

541
00:31:59,478 --> 00:32:00,222
Fail?

542
00:32:00,347 --> 00:32:03,128
Create ridiculous standards
that no human could meet,

543
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:06,590
with your careers, with your kids.
You got to be more like us men.

544
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,718
Be lazy?

545
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:08,947
Blame others?

546
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:10,094
Get help!

547
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:12,179
Most men in your position

548
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,975
have a deputy and 2 assistants at work,
and a wife and two nannies at home.

549
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,768
You're not superwoman.

550
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,687
Don't be a martyr.

551
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:25,578
We'll be injecting
you with naloxone,

552
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:28,087
which will knock the opioids
out of your pain receptors.

553
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,531
If we'reight, your system will
recalibrate within a few hours,

554
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,546
- and most of the pain will be gone.
- Hours?

555
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:34,952
- I need those drugs.
- Not if they're causing pain.

556
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,830
- Then knock me out, sedate me while...
- That'll take drugs too.

557
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,600
We need to clear everything out.

558
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:42,251
- Please, i'll try anything else.
- That's what we're trying to stop.

559
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:50,799
So it's not your parents.
Then it's your wife,

560
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:53,012
- someone you were close...
- A colleague.

561
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:54,789
We were residents together.

562
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,932
I should've done more to stop it.

563
00:32:57,273 --> 00:32:59,621
He had the mother of
all god complexes.

564
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:03,397
So busy treating everyone's problems,
he was blind to his own.

565
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,399
Helped himself to a vial of insulin.

566
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:07,693
It's a miracle he survived.

567
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,237
His friends
and family almost didn't.

568
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,990
He was a selfish ass.

569
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:19,997
It'll be over soon.

570
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,344
This is lunacy.

571
00:33:27,469 --> 00:33:30,007
You're torturing
this guy on a hunch.

572
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,199
It's the only hunch we've got.

573
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:35,020
If I really wanted to torture him,

574
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:38,599
I'd manipulate a clinical trial in
the hopes that he'd sleep with you.

575
00:33:39,693 --> 00:33:42,553
Are you suggesting I got Thirteen in
that trial because of some personal...

576
00:33:42,678 --> 00:33:45,934
I think you got her in because
of your usual messiah complex.

577
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,692
I think you messed with the appointment
schedule because of your

578
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,805
"i like to have sex" complex.

579
00:33:51,602 --> 00:33:53,105
I checked the logs.

580
00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:56,742
You moved your most promising
patient right before her.

581
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:59,595
False hope being
quite the aphrodisiac.

582
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,539
How's it false if
the trials are showing results?

583
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,876
Well, if it were that promising, you
wouldn't have to change the schedule.

584
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:07,641
But, hey...

585
00:34:08,232 --> 00:34:10,062
Hope springs eternal.

586
00:34:17,963 --> 00:34:19,374
This was a cooking accident?

587
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:21,725
First time making cherries jubilee.

588
00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:23,900
Awfully big fire.

589
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:26,846
If you ask me, some of
the portions in that recipe were off.

590
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:30,444
Sure hope it happens
to be covered under, say,

591
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,556
section three,

592
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:35,823
subsection 2.2, paragraph one,
accidental fire damage

593
00:34:36,427 --> 00:34:39,573
in which case you'd have to replace
the entire waterline

594
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:41,374
to fix the sagging pipe.

595
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:43,244
I guess so.

596
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,084
Hate to have your next-door
neighbors end up with no hot water.

597
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:51,046
Lucky the fire escaped
your pipes entirely.

598
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:14,431
It's not working.

599
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:17,823
I know.

600
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,409
I started him back
on the pain meds...

601
00:35:23,336 --> 00:35:25,914
- Which means you can leave.
- My son was right.

602
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:29,029
I tried for so long
to protect him from...

603
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:32,484
but I'm the one who's been selfish.

604
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:36,925
- This is no way for him to live.
- Until we get an answer, it's the way.

605
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:38,469
There is no answer.

606
00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:40,721
- There's always an answer.
- Then what is it?

607
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,756
He's been here four days.

608
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,342
Three suicide attempts.

609
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,080
You don't have an answer.

610
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,140
When I saw you...

611
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:54,485
when I saw the cane,

612
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:58,289
I thought, "thank god.
The doctor will understand."

613
00:35:59,178 --> 00:36:00,783
Because I sure as hell don't.

614
00:36:02,004 --> 00:36:03,535
My husband thinks it's over.

615
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,083
So look me in the eye,

616
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:10,288
tell me you'd want
to live like that.

617
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:16,201
Then stabilize him.

618
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:20,555
Get him in decent enough
shape for the drive home.

619
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:28,885
So he can finally...

620
00:36:34,753 --> 00:36:35,520
okay.

621
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,723
There's got to be
something we can do.

622
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:44,802
We can't just let the patient leave.

623
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:46,427
We didn't. House did.

624
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:48,553
Because he realized there's
nothing he could do.

625
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:52,344
There's always something we can do,
something else we can try.

626
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,635
You're insane.
You know that, right?

627
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,545
Because I have principles?

628
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,853
Because you paid more to bribe me

629
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:08,992
to lie on your claim
than the entire cost of the repair.

630
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:11,162
I don't care if I pay,

631
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:14,773
as long as the people who pocketed
my premiums for the last nine years pay.

632
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,253
I didn't break the pipe.

633
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,118
Whatever.

634
00:37:20,997 --> 00:37:23,740
If you want to stick it to the man,
that's fine by me.

635
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:28,883
- You happy?
- Nope, but I'm right.

636
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:50,976
Lock up on your way out.

637
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:53,245
And don't touch the piano.

638
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:59,776
Testicles.
What do they make you think of?

639
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:03,406
Stds, testosterone issues,
that summer on fire island.

640
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,324
Oh, so close.

641
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,393
The correct answer is epilepsy.

642
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:10,446
Epilepsy doesn't cause chronic pain.

643
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:12,798
It does if it spreads
to the sensory region of the brain,

644
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,891
- then rewires the pain neurons.
- Would've shown up on an eeg.

645
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:18,905
Not if the seizures are in a place
you can't see on an eeg,

646
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,458
a place too deep in the brain,

647
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:23,843
like the area that controls
the muscles supporting the...

648
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:26,633
testicles.

649
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:35,945
Feels like you got kicked in the nads,
doesn't it?

650
00:38:37,868 --> 00:38:40,433
The abdominal pain,
how it all started.

651
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,641
It wasn't the stomach.

652
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,551
It was lower, right?

653
00:38:44,676 --> 00:38:45,822
It's everywhere.

654
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:47,546
But when it first started.

655
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:49,131
It started in the stomach...

656
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:52,149
- Cramps
- Like bad gas, or...

657
00:38:53,027 --> 00:38:54,938
a permeating pain

658
00:38:55,705 --> 00:38:58,495
like your kidneys are being
pulled out through your scrotum.

659
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:02,756
Why?

660
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:05,589
Because epilepsy is treatable.

661
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:18,331
Looks like we shot
the guys with the torches.

662
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:19,654
Yeah.

663
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,219
Pays to hang around.

664
00:40:24,765 --> 00:40:26,869
That selfish ass
with the god complex

665
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:29,301
who almost made
the stupidest decision of his life...

666
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:32,174
wasn't your colleague, was it?

667
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:33,221
It was you.

668
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,181
No.

669
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,183
See you tomorrow.

670
00:40:56,402 --> 00:40:57,708
You're here early.

671
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:00,764
I'm feeling better.

672
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:07,530
- What's wrong?
- I. v.'s leaking a little.

673
00:41:07,655 --> 00:41:08,861
It's no big deal.

674
00:41:08,986 --> 00:41:10,436
I'll be right back.

675
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:12,175
Foreman.

676
00:41:14,524 --> 00:41:15,961
You busy tonight?

677
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:19,338
No.

678
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,275
Rita, the spike on Dr. Hadley's i. V.
Bag wasn't pushed in all the way.

00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,342
- I don't want any dosing errors.
- Sorry.

680
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:34,834
It won't happen again.

681
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,357
It stinks, doesn't it?

682
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:38,745
- What?
- The medication.

683
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:41,496
When we switch out the bags,
you can smell it. It's disgusting.

684
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:42,986
I didn't smell anything.

685
00:41:43,743 --> 00:41:45,644
She must be on the placebo, then.

686
00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:07,557
You offered to do house's budget

687
00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:10,648
because you wanted him to owe you,
wanted him to take that case.

688
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,959
- Why?
- I thought it would help house...

689
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:15,447
seeing someone worse off than him,
possibly curing a guy

690
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:17,631
who has even less
to look forward to.

691
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:24,734
Can I ask you something?

692
00:42:28,057 --> 00:42:29,815
How would you like my job?

693
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:04,321
