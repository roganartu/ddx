1
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:07,261
Prosciutto's not bad, but it's not
what you're saying about the fortunato.

2
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:15,448
My fish isn't bad.

3
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:17,669
But it's not great either,
I'm sure.

4
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:20,240
I warned you against the snapper.

5
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:33,019
Do you think it'll calm down?
- God, I hope so.

6
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:35,588
That guy is a bit
of a blowhard, though, isn't he?

7
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:37,724
The food's not spicy at all.
You can barely taste it.

8
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,592
Mine's pretty spicy.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,761
Try it.

10
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,007
Mm...I don't taste anything.

11
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,333
You been throwing rolls
at me?

12
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:50,904
Uh...it wasn't me.

13
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:52,939
Uh, really...
he didn't.

14
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:55,709
I'm so sorry someone
would choose to behave that way.

15
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:58,778
Really, I...yeah.

16
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:00,080
I'm...so sorry!

17
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:02,048
Really, really, really
sorry!

18
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:04,784
No, no, no, I swear, I--

19
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:07,754
it's...not...me.

20
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:45,852
Bloody tear could just mean
subconjunctival hemorrhage.

21
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,955
He sneezed too hard from a cold,
which caused his lack of taste.

22
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:51,024
House isn't gonna care.

23
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:53,760
Does black tie optional
really mean black tie?

24
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:55,328
'Cause I don't wanna rent--

25
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:57,096
There's been a glitch
with the wedding.

26
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:58,598
And House will be interested.

27
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,966
A glitch?

28
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,601
Patient had
his corpus callosum cut

29
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:02,602
to correct a seizure issue.

30
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,170
A glitch?

31
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:06,239
The seizures stopped
after the surgery,

32
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:08,474
but he's having trouble
adjusting to a split brain.

33
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:09,909
A glitch?

34
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:13,713
This is Dr. Taub.
Tell him about shopping.

35
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,281
Uh...I go into
a grocery store.

36
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:16,716
Everything seems normal.

37
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,351
I get to the checkout,

38
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,087
and there's all these
extra items in my cart,

39
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:23,122
stuff I didn't put there,
stuff I hate.

40
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,660
My left hand hates me.

41
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:31,464
Yeah.
I think House'll be interested.

42
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:34,500
# clang, clang, clang
went the trolley #

43
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:36,569
# ding ding ding
hmm hmm hmm #

44
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:41,241
Just warning you--
I'm in a good mood.

45
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,142
And largely pain-free,

46
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,478
so I have no idea
how things are going--

47
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:47,513
Alien hand syndrome.

48
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:49,449
Set off by a stroke,

49
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,117
or is there
a pony in the backyard?

50
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,418
Split brain.

51
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:55,188
Right hemisphere
controls the left and--

52
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:56,656
Is making life miserable.

53
00:03:56,724 --> 00:03:58,291
Nonlogical thinkers often do.

54
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,959
Current issue
isn't the split brain.

55
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:01,327
The surgery corrected--

56
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:02,996
You're dissing
the right hemisphere?

57
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:04,430
Most people who have
this operation

58
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:05,832
don't even notice
they're missing anything.

59
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,567
Left brain has language,
arithmetic, rationality.

60
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,035
Right brain is a mute loser.

61
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:10,904
Right brain is more
aesthetically oriented,

62
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:12,338
has greater facial
recognition.

63
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:13,773
I couldn't have been
a plastic surgeon without it.

64
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:15,608
Yes. And where would
junior high be

65
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:18,077
without our ability
to judge people on aesthetics?

66
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:19,879
Right brain's also more
aware of the present moment,

67
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:21,581
our place in the universe.

68
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,350
Mm-hmm. It's a universal
daisy chain of peace and love

69
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:26,085
that throws buns at people.

70
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:28,521
His present symptoms
could mean autoimmune disease,

71
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,925
nasolacrimal tumor,
an infection, or just a cold.

72
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,793
Good morning, sunshine.

73
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,562
We got a brand-new toy.
You wanna play?

74
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,265
We need to talk.

75
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,634
Great. I love euphemisms.

76
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,403
By euphemism I mean
when you say something,

77
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,804
and it means something else.

78
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:46,239
Begin eliminating.

79
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:48,141
Search the home.

80
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:53,780
The, uh...

81
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:55,581
isn't that like
locking the barn door

82
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:57,650
after the horse has put his face
between your breasts

83
00:04:57,718 --> 00:04:59,519
for an hour and a half?

84
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:01,788
I'm your boss.

85
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:03,690
You're an employee.

86
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:05,692
Well, I'm not normally
into role-playing,

87
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,027
but if you wanna...

88
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:09,862
People who get close to you
get hurt.

89
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,798
That's a fact.

90
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:13,933
You're also a valued doctor
in this hospital.

91
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:15,835
That's another fact.

92
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,738
From now on, we're gonna
focus on the second fact.

93
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:22,275
So this isn't you
freaking out over last night.

94
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:24,944
This isn't
an emotional decision.

95
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:26,746
I'm just giving you
the rules.

96
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:30,049
You can either accept them
or leave.

97
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:54,040
I slept with Cuddy.

98
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:56,209
After she helped me
detox from Vicodin.

99
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,978
I've been clean for
almost 24 hours now.

100
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,719
Okay.
Thought I'd mention it.

101
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:08,621
Wow.

102
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:11,524
Wow!
One for each.

103
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:14,394
That's what she said. Ha...
- How's the pain?

104
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:16,062
She's probably got
some bruising...

105
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,797
Yeah, I get it.
You're a stud.

106
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:20,867
This is serious, House.

107
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:22,702
I feel better than I did
four hours ago.

108
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,505
Four hours from now,
I'll feel better than this.

109
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:27,006
The other wow...
you were sober.

110
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:28,341
She was sober?

111
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:31,044
Clean and sober and hot.

112
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:33,246
Wow!
This is fantastic.

113
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,348
How are you gonna
screw it up?

114
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,450
Several good options.

115
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:38,718
Unfortunately, I don't think

116
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:40,086
she's gonna
give me the pleasure.

117
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:41,921
She left before I woke up,
and five minutes ago

118
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:43,756
she told me that
I'm just an employee.

119
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:45,892
Ha.
- Yes.

120
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,796
Well, either she's actually
in love with you and scared,

121
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:53,566
or she realized last night
was a gigantic mistake...

122
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:56,069
you were needy and vulnerable,
she was maternal...

123
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:57,336
You think she jumped me
out of pity?

124
00:06:57,404 --> 00:07:00,440
No. I'm saying
whatever's going on,

125
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:03,142
you...need to talk to her.

126
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,813
Absolutely.

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,749
Does our patient
freak you out a little?

128
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,884
No.

129
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:14,387
If he's two people,
then we're all two people,

130
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:16,456
and we just don't know it.

131
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,357
What does that say
about identity?

132
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:21,327
It says...we're making it up
as we go along,

133
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,262
which I find freeing.

134
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,398
Wow, I haven't been
in a bathroom this size

135
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:29,735
since my dorm in med school.

136
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:33,139
Is that fungus?
- It's from the steam buildup.

137
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,044
What do you think
of this glitch

138
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:40,446
with Chase and Cameron's
wedding?

139
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:45,885
It's always a sad thing
when sperm comes between people.

140
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,121
I hear the sperm
is very good today.

141
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:50,623
I mean the salmon.

142
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:57,797
Go away.
- No other tables.

143
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:02,969
You'd let your wife
keep another man's offspring

144
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:06,305
on ice next to the frozen peas
just in case?

145
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:07,974
That's what this is about.

146
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,742
She's not ready
to commit to me.

147
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,577
She's planning for failure.

148
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:13,279
Did you know that male
fruit flies

149
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:15,882
have toxic chemicals
in their seminal fluid

150
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,050
that inhibit the sperm
of other males?

151
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,428
Wilson says we need to talk.

152
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:33,399
We talked.
- I agree.

153
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:36,802
This has clearly gotten past
the talking stage.

154
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:41,574
What?

155
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:45,178
Hey.

156
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:48,080
Great. Did you find my MP3?

157
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:49,448
Uh, not yet.

158
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,984
But I got your shaving stuff,

159
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:56,022
toothpaste, deodorant,
some magazines...

160
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,491
and this cactus
from your window.

161
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,992
You didn't have to do that,
really.

162
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,861
The hospital supplies
all that stuff.

163
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:03,462
I'm still trying
too hard, huh?

164
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,765
Trying to get
your other half to like me.

165
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:08,367
Don't say that, okay?
I like you.

166
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:11,103
Which means that--

167
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:17,210
we shouldn't read into that.
- Anti-fungal meds.

168
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:19,111
Ordinarily, we'd put them
in your IV,

169
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,981
but since your right brain
doesn't seem too fond of IVs...

170
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,749
You should be feeling
better in a few days.

171
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,051
I have to get back
to work.

172
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:27,787
Rick says your shift
will be waiting for you

173
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:30,089
when you get back.
- Thanks.

174
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:31,624
Oh! Oh, my God!

175
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:35,728
God! I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

176
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:37,697
I'm sorry.
- I have to--

177
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:40,066
I have to get back to work.
- Babe, wait, hold on!

178
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:43,569
No, it wasn't me!

179
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:46,038
I can't walk.

180
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:51,271
Well, obviously,
it wasn't the fungus.

181
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:52,572
And it's not
a coordination issues.

182
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,408
Dehydration can cause
loss of balance.

183
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:56,376
We haven't had him on IV.
- No, good skin turgor.

184
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:57,778
Not orthostatic.

185
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:00,614
Could be
our tax dollars at work.

186
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:03,650
Constantly building
new roadways and bridges.

187
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:06,219
A meningioma.
Slow growing.

188
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,488
Could extend along
the subosteal layer

189
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:10,524
of the cranial cavity
and be hidden by the bone.

190
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,859
The cancer cells are
actually re-growing a connection

191
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,294
between the left
and right hemispheres.

192
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:15,695
If you're right,
the two halves have begun

193
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:18,065
sending messages again,
but it's too early

194
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:19,399
in the process for him
to pick up on it.

195
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:22,269
But...we can test for it.

196
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:28,241
Proof.

197
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,945
You didn't talk to her,
did you?

198
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:34,815
If I talked, she'd have lied,
I'd have lied.

199
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:37,084
And though two negatives
make a positive,

200
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,286
I thought thermal imaging photos
seemed simpler.

201
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:42,055
Note how many more
heated areas appear

202
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:43,557
after less than
a minute with me.

203
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:46,026
So it's either love
or possibly rage.

204
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:47,727
Don't talk to her.

205
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,796
I have no plans
to talk to her.

206
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,698
Manipulation
is in your genetic Code.

207
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,467
You think I'm making a mistake,
you move in to correct.

208
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:55,502
You are making a mistake.
- She lied to me.

209
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,937
Either last night or today.

210
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,772
I need to find out which
and why.

211
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,407
And clearly,
thermal imaging is the way.

212
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:01,741
This isn't a case.

213
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:03,176
You're not looking for
a diagnosis.

214
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:04,778
If this matters at all to you,

215
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:08,849
please, for once in your life,
be an adult.

216
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:13,687
Keep your eyes focused
on the plus sign.

217
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,789
Any image that appears
on your far right

218
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:17,090
will only be seen
by your left brain.

219
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:19,559
And any image on your far left

220
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,027
will only be seen
by your right brain.

221
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:22,329
Okay.

222
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:25,432
Just start by saying
the words.

223
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,766
Book.

224
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,535
Giraffe.

225
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:30,971
Willow.

226
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,005
Fortunate.

227
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:39,346
You're not saying the word.

228
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:43,083
I didn't see a word.

229
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,518
Could you draw a picture

230
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,852
of what you think
the word might be?

231
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,057
Uh, look, I-I didn't see...

232
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:57,063
Candle.

233
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,865
This is so cool.

234
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,567
Yeah, that's not freaky
at all.

235
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:02,602
No communication.

236
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,872
So far.

237
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:17,517
Scott, why are you
standing?

238
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,452
Uh...

239
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,188
I'm a little chilly.

240
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:23,323
I thought I'd get a sweater
or something from my room.

241
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:27,093
Is that okay?
- A few more minutes.

242
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,862
And that,
ladies and gentlemen,

243
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,697
is the left hemisphere...

244
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:33,667
the side that's obsessed
with finding answers,

245
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,303
the one that needs things
to make sense, the interpreter.

246
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,604
That's where we tell the story

247
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:38,972
of who we are
and why we do things.

248
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,874
That's also the side
that was wrong.

249
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:43,143
Right brain's advantage
is that it isn't logical,

250
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,312
doesn't choose which details
to look at,

251
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,214
makes connections
you could never see.

252
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:50,050
You owe your insight
to the "mute loser."

253
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:52,619
I'll send it tickets
to a Phillies game.

254
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,187
Confabulation
means no communication.

255
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:56,056
Means your theory's wrong.

256
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:02,329
But he is cold.

257
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:12,072
Why are you scratching?

258
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,708
It itches.
- Ammonia breath.

259
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:27,120
Your liver is failing.

260
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:28,722
I know for them
to approve this price,

261
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:30,824
they'll need statistical
documentation.

262
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:33,426
What?
Why are you looking at me?

263
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:34,961
When you first walked in,

264
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,330
I was under the impression
you wanted to...

265
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:39,499
say something else.

266
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,467
Nope.

267
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:42,802
About House and me.

268
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,538
There's nothing
to talk about.

269
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:53,246
I want permission
to do a liver biopsy.

270
00:13:53,314 --> 00:13:55,181
We're looking for sarcoidosis.

271
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:57,951
Fine.
- What do you mean, fine?

272
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,286
What do you mean
what do I mean?

273
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:01,554
Do you mean because
a liver biopsy

274
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:03,857
is not a test that, by any
stretch of the imagination,

275
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:05,425
can be considered risky,

276
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:07,327
so asking my permission
is essentially wasting my time,

277
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:10,163
and you're wondering what
my reaction to that will be?

278
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:11,831
Yes.

279
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,667
Are you trying
to make me angry?

280
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,235
Yes.
- Do your biopsy.

281
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:16,703
And also do your clinic hours.

282
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:19,239
I'm blowing off
my clinic hours.

283
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:21,975
Really?
Let's see how that goes.

284
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:28,348
Still not angry.
Try again later.

285
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:42,858
Ah...sorry.
I know I'm a little ripe.

286
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:45,094
Just a sweaty guy.
- Recently?

287
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:47,796
Always.

288
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:50,532
Uh, with a crazy left hand.

289
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,267
Sometimes I fantasize
about cutting it off.

290
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:53,836
Just a fantasy.

291
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:57,906
It's the hand that's crazy,
not me.

292
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,078
What? If it doesn't like
an ultrasound wand,

293
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:07,116
how's it gonna react
to a needle?

294
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:09,818
Can you get music
into this room?

295
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,954
I think you're using
your relationship with Cuddy

296
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:14,023
as a replacement for drugs.

297
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,058
You should be in more pain
so soon into detoxing,

298
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:18,594
but your body's
full of romantic endorphins.

299
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,095
And on top of that,

300
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:22,998
you create this distraction
of looking for proof.

301
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,401
Think I should stop
and let the pain flood back?

302
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,302
Cuddy is not
a Vicodin substitute.

303
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,737
Quite the opposite.

304
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:31,340
You have to wait
for her to be ready.

305
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,574
Great advice.

306
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:34,777
You pretend
that I'm gonna do that.

307
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:37,079
You've made two major
changes in your life.

308
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:39,148
Not a time anyone's
judgment is at its best.

309
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:40,716
Didn't you use to argue

310
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:42,885
that my judgment
would be better off drugs?

311
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:45,454
Admit it--you're curious
why I wanna make her angry.

312
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:47,623
I'm sure it's convoluted,
wrong, and stupid.

313
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,459
You're dying to know what
I found on her coffee cup.

314
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,629
No. Because--
- Oxytocin.

315
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,469
Oxytocin...

316
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:02,538
The chemical involved
in emotional bonding?

317
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:04,073
Her lips say no...

318
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,242
her hormones say,
"oh, my God, yes, more!"

319
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,812
No. For you to know
her levels were elevated

320
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,313
you'd need a base line
to compare them with.

321
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:12,948
I paid the guy in the gym

322
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:15,017
to retrieve one of her
water bottles from the trash.

323
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:18,153
Love inspires us
to greatness.

324
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:20,489
So I need to make her
lose her temper...

325
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:21,890
which breaks her delusion,

326
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,559
which demonstrates to me
and to her

327
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,761
that there is something
underneath this facade.

328
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:27,162
And then what happens?

329
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,330
She admits everything
and falls into your arms?

330
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:29,331
That's outcome one.

331
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,501
Outcome two...is she kills me.

332
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,771
I think it's 50/50 right now.

333
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,005
Great.

334
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:39,041
I thought you'd say that!

335
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:40,609
You're committing
yourself to something--

336
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:42,311
<i>Someone.</i>

337
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:45,247
I mean, it's childish
in a way,

338
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:47,149
but ultimately great.

339
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,784
Assuming...

340
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:52,321
are you absolutely sure
you want this to succeed?

341
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:56,358
Why is an old guy
standing in my doorway?

342
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:58,227
Eugene Schwartz.

343
00:16:58,294 --> 00:16:59,895
Eugene Schwartz.

344
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:02,631
Dr. Cuddy asked me to come
up here from the clinic.

345
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,901
She says you're seeing patients
in your office.

346
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:08,203
It's still free, though,
isn't it?

347
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:10,839
She sent him.
That's gotta mean something.

348
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:14,042
I'll go get my decoder ring.

349
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,614
I squawk.

350
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,883
Like a parrot.

351
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,718
Aaww!

352
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:25,587
No, that's not it.
It started a few months ago.

353
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,923
I was doing some woodworking
in my garage.

354
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:29,714
I was trying to make a chair.

355
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,583
Was it the chair?

356
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,785
Anyway, all of a sudden,
from nowhere,

357
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,222
this strange noise comes
bursting out of my mouth--

358
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,223
Caaaww!

359
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,259
Caaaww!

360
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,794
Tough to fake that.

361
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,164
Nice pants.

362
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,267
My wife Mona thinks
I'm bustin' her chops.

363
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,737
It's ruining my marriage.
Where are we going?

364
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,608
So your left hand
would rather play air guitar

365
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,343
than give me a hard time?

366
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,446
It'd rather play air guitar
than tie shoes, eat dinner...

367
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,682
Your right hand's
playing too.

368
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,418
I don't wanna
discourage it.

369
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,659
Splinter hemorrhages
under his fingernails.

370
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,362
What's that?
What--

371
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,733
BP and 02 sats are dropping!

372
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,401
Need a bag of B-negative
in here!

373
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,503
So much for sarcoidosis.

374
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,739
Points to
a clotting issue.

375
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,774
Clots would explain
all his symptoms.

376
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,509
Why aren't we
in the office?

377
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,111
I'm tired of clinic duty.

378
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,348
There's only one thing that
could cause squawking, right?

379
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,918
Yeah. We gave him heparin
and did an echo of his heart

380
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,186
to see if it was
throwing clots, but--

381
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,455
More air guitar?
- The heart's fine.

382
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,457
We wanted to test
for factor V leiden,

383
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,725
Protein C, protein S,

384
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,727
but the hand got tired
of cooperating.

385
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,395
We finally knocked him out.

386
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,297
And all those tests
came up negative anyway,

387
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,732
or you would have opened
by telling me

388
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,200
your brilliant diagnosis.

389
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,068
He apologized
for being sweaty,

390
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,670
said it had always
been an issue,

391
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,205
but what if it's a symptom?

392
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,740
There are cancers
that cause night sweats

393
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,907
and can lead to clots--
Lymphoma...

394
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,910
Or pancreatic cancer.

395
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,314
Go scan his pancreas.

396
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,783
And...

397
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,285
try Led Zeppelin.

398
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,187
We've always remembered
what this hospital did for Leo

399
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,922
when his appendix burst.

400
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,724
Still, a check this size...

401
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,160
Sorry to interrupt.

402
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,896
Here's my poo.

403
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,765
Dr. House said to bring it
over and leave it with you

404
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,299
as soon as I could.

405
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,669
I don't know if you people
have an official term for it--

406
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,171
Stool sample.
- Ah, yes.

407
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,639
Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

408
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,242
It's hard to rush
these things.

409
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,778
Even if you've eaten
a lot of broccoli.

410
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,717
Where you goin'?
- Annie called.

411
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,219
She's not coming back.

412
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,788
This is not the best time.

413
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,057
You said the heparin would
keep new clots from forming.

414
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,793
Maybe. But something's
obviously causing the clots.

415
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,994
If you have
pancreatic cancer--

416
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,529
We're not trying
to scare you,

417
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,497
but even in its early stages,
the fatality rate--

418
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,967
You walk out of here--
- Stop!

419
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,237
Look, I'd ask you to put
yourself in my place,

420
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,506
but nobody can put themselves
in my place.

421
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,575
Did she find somebody new?

422
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,143
Was I not being
attentive enough?

423
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,245
No.

424
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,549
She's just tired of being
insulted by a limb.

425
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,019
She said that my feelings
toward her were mixed.

426
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,355
Well, my feelings
aren't mixed.

427
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,291
You're not goin' anywhere

428
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,060
unless you wanna go naked.

429
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:32,597
Your right brain
knows you need to stay.

430
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:36,634
My right brain's an ass.

431
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,806
Got a minute?

432
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,542
There's something wrong
with this cup.

433
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,377
I need someone
to bounce ideas off of,

434
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,779
someone to be my whiteboard.

435
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,447
That's how
you taught me to work.

436
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,150
I have three choices:
First--I can accept it's over,

437
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,952
pretend we don't work
in the same hospital,

438
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,754
have selective visual impairment

439
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,455
when we pass each other
in the hall.

440
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,125
Second--I can accept
it's over and leave--

441
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,860
Or you could try
making him angry.

442
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,394
Standard choice number three.

443
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,164
Third...I can talk to him,

444
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:10,668
but it's not like I have
any new facts I can present.

445
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,070
And Chase has this
romantic view of love

446
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,405
that reality
can't compete with.

447
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,674
I know how you could succeed.
- How?

448
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,943
Just say the magic words--

449
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,781
"I will destroy
my husband's sperm."

450
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,349
Oh, you mean succeed
without doing that.

451
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,785
Probably not.

452
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,790
I have doubts.
Normal doubts.

453
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,825
It's not wrong to prepare
for bad things to happen

454
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,460
even if you don't
expect them to.

455
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,395
I don't expect my condo
to burn down,

456
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,231
but I have fire insurance.

457
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,267
Patient's girlfriend
left him.

458
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,270
Now he wants to leave us.

459
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,809
If your condo rules
don't let you buy insurance,

460
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,411
would you go homeless?

461
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,915
His room is this way.

462
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,683
What, do you think
I can fix this?

463
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,718
We need to offer this guy
something he can only get

464
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,021
if he stays in the hospital--
relationship counseling.

465
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,489
I don't know
if his girlfriend's--

466
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,990
I mean
his two hemispheres.

467
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,725
That's the breakfast
of relationships--

468
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,260
The most important one
of the day.

469
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,163
We need your special skills.

470
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:19,348
Is the guy out there?

471
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:21,650
The guy that's gonna
make my right brain work?

472
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:23,018
Oh, for...

473
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:25,988
What do you think
your right brain wants?

474
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:27,389
How should I know?
It's crazy.

475
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:29,624
It does things
I would never do.

476
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:31,827
Duct of Wirsung's
slightly enlarged

477
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:34,062
but within normal parameters.

478
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,366
Say something.

479
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,668
It's mute.
It can't communicate with you.

480
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:42,938
Maybe you should try
communicating with it.

481
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:47,009
"Talk to her."
the well isn't deep, is it?

482
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:49,144
You're the dominant half.
You make all the decisions.

483
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:52,014
The right side
has no control over anything.

484
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,615
It must be...frustrating.

485
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:56,418
No masses in body
or tail segments.

486
00:22:56,486 --> 00:22:58,453
I can't communicate with it.
That's the whole--

487
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:00,722
When you decide to go and get
groceries, what do you do?

488
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,190
What do you mean?

489
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,059
I put on my jacket,
and I go to the store.

490
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:05,694
Your right brain
has no idea

491
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:08,130
why you're suddenly getting up
and putting on your jacket.

492
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:09,431
It just gets dragged along.

493
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:11,400
Next time,
try saying it out loud.

494
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,168
Just say to the empty air,

495
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:15,103
"Hey, I think
I'll go to the store

496
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:16,805
because we're out of
peanut butter"?

497
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:19,107
How much did they teach you
about people like me

498
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:20,609
when you were learning
to be a therapist?

499
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:23,478
I'm an oncologist.

500
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,414
The right brain
likes what he's saying.

501
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,416
Hasn't moved
the entire scan.

502
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:29,217
Hasn't gotten us
anything, though.

503
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:32,487
Scan's clean.
It's not pancreatic cancer.

504
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:35,557
Clotting could be a problem
well before a solid tumor forms.

505
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,225
It can still be pancreatic.

506
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,493
Yes, but if you want
a diagnosis

507
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:40,295
backed by actual evidence,

508
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:41,696
we should probably
look at other cancers.

509
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:42,998
House.

510
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,667
I just squawked!
- What?

511
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:47,102
Eugene Schwartz,
your patient from yesterday.

512
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,503
I just squawked!

513
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:50,372
I was buying some flowers
for Mona.

514
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,374
It happened
when I was paying the clerk!

515
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:54,743
I assume Dr. Cuddy
gave you this number.

516
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:57,446
Yes! She told me to call you
any time I squawked

517
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:58,814
day or night!

518
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,082
I'm sorry,
but I'm about to lose you

519
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,583
because I'm about to drive
into a tunnel

520
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:04,686
in a canyon on an airplane
while hanging up the phone.

521
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:06,888
I might be getting
some more phone calls,

522
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:08,490
so let's make it fast.

523
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,792
Lymphoma--
- That's right, pancreatic.

524
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,194
I know it's pancreatic.
I know there's evidence.

525
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:14,229
I know we've seen it.
I just can't--

526
00:24:14,297 --> 00:24:16,865
Right brain,
left brain issues?

527
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:19,334
If the cancer's
too small to find,

528
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:21,870
let's make it easier.
Let's open him up and paint it.

529
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:24,339
There's a new procedure
using scorpion toxin

530
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:25,740
and infrared paint.

531
00:24:25,808 --> 00:24:27,042
Paint only works
on the cancer cells,

532
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,510
makes 'em easier to spot.

533
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,545
Just agitating the pancreas
can cause clotting,

534
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:32,481
and you wanna do it to a guy
whose problem is clotting.

535
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:33,982
If I'm right about
pancreatic cancer,

536
00:24:34,117 --> 00:24:35,350
The only chance he's got

537
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:38,253
is finding and removing
those cancer cells now.

538
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:40,355
His brain MRI showed
narrowing in the blood vessels

539
00:24:40,423 --> 00:24:41,823
leading up from the neck.

540
00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:43,758
If we do shake something loose,
we could kill him.

541
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,729
Clot in his brain
could kill one of them

542
00:24:47,797 --> 00:24:50,465
without affecting the other.

543
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:53,668
He might actually
be okay with that.

544
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:00,208
How long's it gonna take?

545
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:03,645
Assuming he doesn't crash...
A few minutes.

546
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:16,258
Hey...you and Cameron.

547
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,660
I'm sorry.

548
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:24,499
I'll be right back.

549
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:32,407
I don't wanna be homeless.

550
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:34,643
Okay. You can stay
in the condo.

551
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,913
I'll find some other--
- That's not what I mean.

552
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,483
I wanna marry you.

553
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:44,753
I got the forms
to destroy the sperm.

554
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,488
You sure?

555
00:25:46,556 --> 00:25:48,456
Yeah.

556
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,561
I wanna hug you,
but then I'd have to rescrub.

557
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:55,130
I know.

558
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:57,032
BP's dropping.

559
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,334
Go.

560
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:01,269
No sign of cancer.

561
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:03,471
BP's 90 over 60.

562
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:13,949
You never answered
my question.

563
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:15,650
Relax.

564
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:17,419
Our friendship
is not doomed.

565
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:18,787
Thank God.

566
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:21,923
But my question was
do you really want Cuddy,

567
00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:24,025
or is this just another
challenge?

568
00:26:24,093 --> 00:26:25,660
You're worried that once
I'm in a relationship

569
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:27,229
you and me'll be over.

570
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,663
Hey! I'm actually for this.

571
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:30,332
I think this is great.

572
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:32,934
But if you're serious and
you don't treat it seriously,

573
00:26:33,002 --> 00:26:35,604
then you will get hurt.

574
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:37,672
And if you don't accept that,

575
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,443
then accept
that she will get hurt.

576
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,263
She look angry?

577
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,232
If you're standing there
when she looks up here--

578
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:12,240
Oh, no.

579
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:13,675
Systolic's 80.

580
00:27:13,743 --> 00:27:14,843
Gotta finish this suture
before I can get out.

581
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,645
Give him a dopamine drip.

582
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:18,346
We weren't looking up
at the right time.

583
00:27:18,414 --> 00:27:20,048
Get to your point.
We're a little busy here.

584
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:23,418
The clots aren't from cancer.
They're coming from his heart.

585
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:25,487
We echoed the heart.
No clots.

586
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:27,289
Not while we were looking.
Didn't I open with that?

587
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,591
The clots were caused
by an arrhythmia.

588
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:32,527
No arrhythmia.
- Not while we were looking!

589
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:34,095
Intermittent arrhythmia.

590
00:27:34,163 --> 00:27:37,065
This guy pulls our equipment off
at the slightest provocation.

591
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,000
We'd have to be watching
at the exact moment it happened,

592
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:40,468
which I'm guessing,

593
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,871
given the way you two are
scrambling around like idiots,

594
00:27:42,938 --> 00:27:44,105
is right now!

595
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:46,675
Yes, I'm saying
do a transesophageal echo.

596
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:48,109
We have to get his BP stable.

597
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:50,378
Absolutely.
Right after the echo.

598
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:54,349
Systolic 70.

599
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,484
The heart looked healthy
at the last echo.

600
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:59,287
And an arrhythmia wouldn't cause
clots in a healthy ventricle.

601
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:01,489
So start with the left
atrial appendage.

602
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:08,863
Wow.
- Yep.

603
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:10,598
I did it again.

604
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,967
Now get this poor guy's
BP under control

605
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,269
And seal off the appendage.

606
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:16,204
Then all we have to do

607
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:18,239
is find out what damaged
his heart

608
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:21,276
before it goes after
something he really needs.

609
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:25,853
So what damages

610
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,570
a healthy 20-year-old heart

611
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,540
enough to make it send out clots
like it's bombing Dresden?

612
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:30,741
Rhabdo?

613
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,742
Would have fried
his kidneys too.

614
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,977
What about Graves?

615
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,179
Thyroid function tests
were normal.

616
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,847
Cushing's.

617
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,717
Cortisol overproduction could
interfere with heart rhythm.

618
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:43,087
Run a dexamethasone
suppression test.

619
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,467
Annie.

620
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,205
You hit me.

621
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,442
I know.
I'm so sorry, but...

622
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,876
It wasn't me.

623
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,411
I know you would never
have done that

624
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,913
if you were in control
of yourself, but...

625
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,115
But you came back.

626
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,017
To talk with your doctors.

627
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,487
I've been going over
and over what happened,

628
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,089
and I had this thought
out of nowhere.

629
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,724
Ever since I've known Scott,

630
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,759
I've seen his left hand
throw things

631
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,628
but always sort of playfully,
thinking it's fun.

632
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,665
But when he threw this...

633
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,467
it was angry,

634
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,902
and that's when
his hand slapped me, too,

635
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,838
when I brought it to him.

636
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,006
Could it mean something?

637
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,774
Deodorant shouldn't--

638
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,709
How often do you use it?

639
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,812
Uh, a few times a day.
It's special heavy duty stuff.

640
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,247
I have to send away for it.

641
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,017
Sprayed around a bathroom
the size of a shoebox.

642
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,219
I'll check the ingredients
from the manufacturer.

643
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,354
I'll check for any references
associated with health issues.

644
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,598
Somebody's grateful.

645
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,701
We'll just leave the...
three of you alone.

646
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,714
Why is there
no lipstick on this cup?

647
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:20,151
Cuddy was wearing lipstick
when she drank from it.

648
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,086
It was on my face.
Why isn't it on the cup?

649
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,056
Why is it always reasonable
in Houseland

650
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,757
to take an emotional problem

651
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,227
and sidestep it by turning it
into a mechanical problem?

652
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,929
Because in Houseland--

653
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,397
and the rest of the universe,
by the way--

654
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,800
when a question presents itself,
it calls for an answer.

655
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:39,603
If the left brain
is the interpreter of reality

656
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,373
and the one that tells us
the story of who we are,

657
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,775
then what is your story?

658
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,878
Do you wanna be
the man with the answers,

659
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:51,215
or do you wanna be
the man with Cuddy?

660
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:03,194
What do I do?

661
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,296
You make her angry.

662
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,199
You really think that was
the best time to mock me?

663
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,535
I'm as surprised as you,
but I think I'm serious.

664
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,970
Communication can't start
unless you're--

665
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,339
I've been trying
to make her angry for--

666
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,440
No, you haven't.

667
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,209
Come on!

668
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,177
Poo, strippers?
It's routine stuff.

669
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,279
You've been pulling
your punches.

670
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,582
You're scared.
You should be.

671
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:33,124
Now...go terrorize her.

672
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,369
You don't wanna
destroy it, do you?

673
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:48,305
I said I was gonna do it.
I'll do it.

674
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,375
But you don't want to.

675
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,444
I wanna be with you.

676
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,246
Maybe I'm not
comfortable with it--

677
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,381
Let's say it's our fifth
anniversary.

678
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:00,217
Are you ready
to destroy it now?

679
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,920
Tenth.
Three kids.

680
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,822
They spend their summers
in Melbourne

681
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,357
And have annoying accents.

682
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,991
It's disgusting
how happy we are.

683
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:11,361
You ready now?

684
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,533
You don't have doubts.

685
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,469
You just don't wanna kill

686
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:23,306
the only thing left
of someone you loved.

687
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,949
Don't do it.

688
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,552
I do have trouble
giving things up.

689
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,623
For example...

690
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:43,326
I never cancelled
any of our wedding plans.

691
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:01,744
Attention!
I have an announcement.

692
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:03,179
As you go about your day,

693
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,248
I would like you
to be aware of the fact

694
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,950
that I slept with Lisa Cuddy!

695
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,087
This is beyond ass-hood!

696
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:43,457
You have the luxury
of not caring about your image.

697
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,159
I do not!

698
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:47,061
I can permit a lot of crap,

699
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:49,564
but an employee
shouting about

700
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,099
his sexual
exploits with me--no!

701
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,068
That is zero tolerance!

702
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:55,770
So congratulations, House.

703
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,538
I am angry.

704
00:33:57,606 --> 00:34:01,843
I was wondering
if we should move in together.

705
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:13,120
You're fired.

706
00:34:15,991 --> 00:34:17,692
I wouldn't worry about it.

707
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,393
I think she likes you.

708
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,395
If I'm fired,
I think that probably means

709
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:23,130
I don't have to see patients.

710
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:26,934
I'm here as a squeaky wheel.
I know how you doctors are.

711
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:28,636
You're busy,
you get distracted.

712
00:34:28,704 --> 00:34:31,239
My lab results could be
sitting in your in-box.

713
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:34,275
I don't need your labs.
You have acid reflux.

714
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:35,509
Well, how could you--

715
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,445
Acid splashes
on the vocal chords.

716
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:39,680
They tense,
make that squawking sound.

717
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:41,249
It's completely harmless.

718
00:34:41,316 --> 00:34:42,450
I'm gonna give you
a prescription,

719
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:43,951
and you are gonna go away.

720
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:46,087
You are a great doctor.

721
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:47,588
Ha.

722
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:49,824
Why'd you move your belt?

723
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,425
I always move my belt.

724
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:53,461
Makes me sore.

725
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:55,463
You didn't tell me that.

726
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,665
At 86, what isn't sore?

727
00:34:57,733 --> 00:35:01,903
Soreness is less important
than squawking.

728
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,639
It's the squawking that was
bothering my wife.

729
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:09,176
That's not a potbelly.
It's a tumor.

730
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,983
That's why pancreatic cancer
was on my mind.

731
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:18,486
My brain was trying
to tell me.

732
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:20,454
This isn't sounding good.

733
00:35:20,522 --> 00:35:23,257
Pancreatic cancer?

734
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:26,427
It can cause acid reflux.
We should scope you.

735
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:29,830
So it's not good.
Even for cancer it's not good.

736
00:35:29,898 --> 00:35:31,732
No, it's not.

737
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,502
The deodorant has a high
proportion of propylene glycol.

738
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:35,970
Same stuff made a kid
in Singapore

739
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:38,739
develop a heart condition,
and--get this--seizures.

740
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:42,109
Our patient may never have
needed split-brain surgery.

741
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:44,779
I'm sure he will
half-appreciate the irony.

742
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:51,319
Take this man to radiology.
Pancreatic scan.

743
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:55,189
And stay with him.

744
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:57,959
Eugene Schwartz.

745
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:12,807
Whatever it is,
just say it quickly.

746
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:16,510
Do you have more than one
lipstick in the same shade?

747
00:36:16,578 --> 00:36:21,048
Maybe one that has a sealing
agent and one that doesn't?

748
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:25,920
How could that possibly
be relevant to anything?

749
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:29,290
You really don't think
you're just...

750
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,093
overreacting
to the other night?

751
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:37,398
Fine. I am overreacting.

752
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:40,701
You've said plenty of lousy
things to me before.

753
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,570
But...

754
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:45,840
reaching the final straw
has been a good thing

755
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,608
because it made me realize

756
00:36:47,676 --> 00:36:51,078
we not only don't have
a personal relationship,

757
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:53,647
we never could.

758
00:36:56,551 --> 00:37:00,721
You--you're--

759
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:05,559
you've been overreacting...

760
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:08,195
to something I said?

761
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:10,998
You insulted me.
I walked out.

762
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:15,503
It's nothing that hasn't
happened a hundred times before.

763
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,777
I quit.

764
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:26,113
Great.

765
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:29,750
My Nanny is off the clock
at 7:30,

766
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:32,053
so...
you're a week off.

767
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,555
You can go suckle
the little bastard child

768
00:37:34,623 --> 00:37:38,259
if it makes you feel good
about yourself.

769
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:40,861
Screw you.

770
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:01,882
No, no, that--
that's not what happened.

771
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,784
I told you that I needed you.

772
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:06,887
You--you helped me.

773
00:38:06,955 --> 00:38:09,757
Are you okay?

774
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:36,050
Are you okay?

775
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:26,627
So...this is the story

776
00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:29,296
you made up about who you are.

777
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:33,033
It's a nice one.

778
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:38,172
Too bad it isn't true.

779
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:48,515
No.

780
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:51,185
I'm not okay.

781
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:07,361
# it is the evening
of the day #

782
00:42:09,264 --> 00:42:15,736
# I sit and watch
the children play #

783
00:42:17,772 --> 00:42:21,408
# smiling faces I can see #

784
00:42:21,476 --> 00:42:25,713
# but not for me #

785
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:33,620
# I sit and watch
as tears go by #

786
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:14,728
# it is the evening
of the day #

787
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:23,203
# I sit and watch
the children play #

788
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:29,176
# doing things I used to do #

789
00:43:29,244 --> 00:43:34,281
# they think are new #

790
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:40,053
# I sit and watch
