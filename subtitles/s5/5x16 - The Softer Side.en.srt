1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,668
I want to reassure you,

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:05,905
your child can have
a completely normal life.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:10,676
How can a baby have
male and female DNA?

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:14,280
It's a condition called
genetic mosaicism.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:19,218
The ambiguous genitalia
can be surgically repaired.

6
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,620
Repaired?

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,656
Made to look more...typical.

8
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,792
More typical?

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,294
But you haven't even told us

10
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,631
if the baby's a boy
or a girl.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,032
That's...

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,007
that's a choice you
have to make.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,676
Nice job, Jackson!

14
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:44,877
<i>Whoo!</i>

15
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,649
Take it.

16
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,825
He had the shot.

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,061
<i>He lost his nerve.</i>

18
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,029
Honey, it's okay.
He's doing great.

19
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:08,901
Three.

20
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,056
No fear that time.

21
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,360
Whoo!

22
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,668
Melanie.

23
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,503
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

24
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,372
Jackson!

25
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,384
Black heels or the boots?

26
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,655
You know I'm a fan
of those heels.

27
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:42,161
Boots it is.

28
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,295
For all we know,

29
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,831
House knows you're a fan
of those heels.

30
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,266
You think House
is gonna figure out

31
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,567
we faked our break-up
because of your shoes?

32
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,005
Go with the boots.

33
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,044
Gonna eat that?

34
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,180
Have at it.

35
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,081
Did you just ask
my permission

36
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,983
before you took my food?

37
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,286
Yes, we can.

38
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,454
Adolescent genetic mosaicism.

39
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,689
Collapsed during
a basketball game.

40
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,890
Presenting with persistent
pelvic pain.

41
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,859
Fun.

42
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,027
The parents haven't told
their son

43
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,262
that he could've been
their daughter.

44
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,463
They want assurance
that you won't either.

45
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,899
Less fun, but still.

46
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,342
That was easy.

47
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,478
Our new patient.

48
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,280
Part girl,

49
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,015
part boy.

50
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,284
All 13's dream date.

51
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,053
Severe pelvic pain

52
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,121
<i>started during
a basketball game.</i>

53
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,556
Could be dehydration.

54
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,257
ER gave him fluids
when he came in.

55
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,159
<i>Still it feels chronic.</i>

56
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,461
We've got a kid
who could mate with himself,

57
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,762
and we think he didn't have
enough to drink?

58
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,797
<i>There are dozens
of intersex disorders.</i>

59
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,133
<i>Persistent pelvic pain
could mean</i>

60
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,134
<i>congenital adrenal hyperplasia,</i>

61
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,969
PMDS--

62
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,171
Those conditions occur
in intersex kids

63
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,406
<i>who are chromosomally
XX or XY.</i>

64
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,540
<i>Not XX and XY.</i>

65
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,042
<i>Parents recently started him</i>

66
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,577
on testosterone.
Maybe there's some--

67
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,179
Vitamins wouldn't cause
pelvic pain.

68
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,349
There's a note in here.

69
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,584
We're supposed to refer

70
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,985
to his testosterone shots
as vitamins.

71
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,854
<i>His parents aren't just liars.</i>

72
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,422
they want us to be liars too.

73
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,790
I won't do it.

74
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,925
You guys will, though.

75
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,293
<i>He's a kid.</i>

76
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,628
Parents don't think
he's ready to deal with it.

77
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,096
<i>My dad was the same way
about me</i>

78
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,865
maybe having Huntington's.

79
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,200
Well, that was your experience.

80
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,869
It should surely apply
in this situation.

81
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,605
Pain could be caused

82
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,673
by a blind uterus
hidden in his abdomen.

83
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,308
He needs an MRI.

84
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,077
<i> Right.
Boy with girl genes.</i>

85
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,780
I'm sure you're the first doctor
brilliant enough

86
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,014
<i>to check for a uterus.</i>

87
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,382
<i>He could have complications</i>

88
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,283
<i>from the surgeries
on his penis.</i>

89
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,551
That can cause pelvic pain.

90
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,986
Way to multi-task.

91
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,287
Impress your boss

92
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,322
<i>and humiliate your Ex.</i>

93
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,191
MRI is a waste of time.

94
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,926
To continue the humiliation,

95
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,594
you'll put a camera
up his penis.

96
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,332
<i> You're Dr. House,
aren't you?</i>

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,401
What do you think's wrong
with our son?

98
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,639
These people were just coming
to tell you.

99
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,574
This is better.

100
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,210
Don't have to worry
about them losing their way.

101
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,846
We think that he has
a blind uterus.

102
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,247
He should have an MRI.

103
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,449
Did you send 'em a text?

104
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,084
<i>Over the past 13 years,</i>

105
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,452
we've educated ourselves.

106
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,189
Who needs med school
when you got Wi-Fi?

107
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,259
Let's schedule their son
for an MRI with contrast

108
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,195
<i>right away.</i>

109
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,429
Thank you.
- Thanks.

110
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,000
You said an MRI
was a waste of time.

111
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,268
So is arguing with them.

112
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,774
<i>Contrast's in.</i>

113
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,375
Jackson,
we're gonna get started,

114
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:48,047
so try to lie still.

115
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,381
How long do you think

116
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,184
the post-break-up awkwardness
is gonna last?

117
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,554
Foreman and I are both
professionals.

118
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,289
Stomach and liver are clear.

119
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,258
If by professional you mean

120
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,194
he's a T-1000 build
by cyberdyne systems.

121
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,662
I never understood what
you saw in him.

122
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,432
He's not really your type, huh?

123
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,133
Moving down through
the pelvic floor.

124
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,902
Here's my impression
of Foreman

125
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,241
on the happiest day
of his life.

126
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,510
Now the saddest day
of his life.

127
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,880
We just broke up.

128
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,782
I'm not quite ready
to mock him yet.

129
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,218
House was a jerk
to split you two up.

130
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:30,356
But, bottom line,
he did you a favor.

131
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,524
Area around the intestinal tract
is clear.

132
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:37,930
No blind uterus.

133
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,403
I think there's something wrong
with House.

134
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,306
Who's he making miserable now?

135
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,674
Actually no one.

136
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,809
He okay'd an MRI
just because the parents

137
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,778
wanted to look
for a blind uterus.

138
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,647
There was no fighting,
no arguing.

139
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,848
He just went along.

140
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,916
It's a valid medical theory.

141
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,752
He doesn't think it is.

142
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,888
House decided to humor
these parents.

143
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,425
Maybe he had
a great cup of coffee.

144
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,060
Or a tremendous bowel movement.

145
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,163
Bottom line is your boss
is in a good mood.

146
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,465
Stop analyzing it
and just enjoy it.

147
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,741
We're gonna use this scope

148
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,143
to fill your bladder
with saline.

149
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,879
Then examine your urethra
for any narrow spots.

150
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,014
Why would there be
a narrow spot?

151
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:33,419
Sometimes it just happens.

152
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,087
Can my parents come in?

153
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,023
Sure.

154
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,225
I thought it'd be awkward
for you having them here.

155
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,794
I have this feeling

156
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,263
they've seen me naked before.

157
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:47,967
Now take a breath.
Just try to relax.

158
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,038
Mom.

159
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,209
It's okay, honey.

160
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,611
It's okay.

161
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,848
Hey, remember those sprints
they made you run in practice?

162
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,417
Those were so hard.

163
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,887
But you pulled through.

164
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,624
You can do this too.

165
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,159
I'm to the bladder.

166
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,060
Start the saline.

167
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,768
I'm gonna look around
and pull back on the scope.

168
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,538
Feels tight.

169
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,806
<i>That pressure's normal.</i>

170
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,141
Just try to hold on
for a few more minutes.

171
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,178
It's not down there.

172
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,546
<i>It's my chest.</i>

173
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,783
<i>Can't breathe.</i>

174
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,984
Can't bre--

175
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,853
<i>can't breathe.</i>

176
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,654
Is he okay?

177
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,056
Muffled heart sounds.

178
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,157
Jugular's distended.

179
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,592
Pericardial effusion.

180
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,860
We need ten gauge
on a syringe.

181
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,028
<i>What's happening?</i>

182
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,362
His heart is filling
with exudate.

183
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,898
If we don't drain it,
it'll stop beating.

184
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:58,284
We drained the fluid
from his pericardial space.

185
00:08:58,352 --> 00:08:59,385
His heart rate is back
to normal.

186
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,120
Pelvis plus heart.

187
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:02,321
Doesn't fit with any
of the syndromes

188
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:04,157
associated with mosaicism.

189
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:06,059
<i> Could be drugs, toxins,
an infection.</i>

190
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,161
You're okay with this?

191
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,362
With what?

192
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,464
That we're considering
a diagnosis unrelated

193
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:12,665
to this kid being a shemale.

194
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,600
<i>Assuming a coincidence</i>

195
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:16,202
like that would usually
torture you

196
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,437
but you're completely unfazed.

197
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:19,005
<i>Completely unfazed?</i>

198
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:20,440
<i>You think I'm totally lacking</i>

199
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:21,974
in any fazing?

200
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,310
The idea that I'm anything less
than half-fazed

201
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:26,212
I actually find offensive.

202
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,647
It greatly fazes me.

203
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:28,648
He started testosterone--

204
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:29,982
Vitamins.

205
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,584
A few months ago.

206
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:33,052
That can cause autoimmune
diseases

207
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,887
<i>like polyarteritis
and SLE</i>

208
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:37,023
<i>which can cause
pericardial effusion</i>

209
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:38,391
and pelvic pain.

210
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:39,358
So it is related.

211
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:43,596
Now I'm unfazed.

212
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:46,199
Start him on corticosteroids
for the autoimmune.

213
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,201
Finasteride to block
the vitamins.

214
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:58,611
You slept with House.

215
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,379
He asked permission
before taking my bagel.

216
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:03,049
Took the case without a fight.

217
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:05,451
Honored the parents' request
for an MRI.

218
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,420
Yes, those were my terms
for sleeping with him.

219
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,955
He's in a good mood.

220
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,357
Sex with me would explain that.

221
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:13,092
But it doesn't explain

222
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,162
why I'm not curled up
in a ball weeping in shame.

223
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,197
I did not have sex with House.

224
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:20,800
If you two aren't keeping
something from me,

225
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:23,736
that means he's keeping
something from both of us.

226
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:25,171
That can't be good.

227
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,405
Or he's just in a good mood.

228
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:27,840
This is not a crisis.

229
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:30,610
Maybe you can get back
some of that money he owes you.

230
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:35,848
Hmm.

231
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:40,520
Testosterone blocker?

232
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:43,856
Does that mean if Jackson
has SLE

233
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:45,191
or whatever
that other thing was,

234
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,360
that he'd had to go off
the hormones?

235
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:48,995
Probably.

236
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:51,297
Then Jackson'll stop
developing.

237
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,299
He'll never go through puberty.

238
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,735
Maybe this isn't what's wrong
with him.

239
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:57,470
Maybe the testosterone
didn't cause it.

240
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:00,873
Yeah, but if it is,
then he'll never be a man.

241
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:03,910
Did we make the wrong choice?

242
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:13,519
You'll need to tell him
the testosterone blocker

243
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:17,423
is something else.

244
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,858
Or maybe this is
a good opportunity

245
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:20,793
to tell him the truth.

246
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,595
It might make it simpler.

247
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:24,530
For all of you.

248
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:28,868
You want us to tell
a sick adolescent boy

249
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:31,003
that he's really not
an adolescent boy?

250
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:33,339
That...doesn't
seem simpler to me.

251
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,076
No.

252
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:40,413
Just...

253
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,381
give him the meds.

254
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,619
So you have pain

255
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:49,589
in one arm and both your legs.

256
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:51,324
does it hurt right now?

257
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:53,059
No.

258
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:55,861
It's when I, like,
put pressure on them.

259
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:58,130
See...

260
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:01,100
it hurts when I do this.

261
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:02,134
Ow.

262
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:05,571
And this.

263
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,907
Ow.

264
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:10,843
And this.

265
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:12,278
Ow.

266
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:15,214
What about this?

267
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:18,084
Aah!

268
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:20,920
Ow!

269
00:12:20,988 --> 00:12:24,457
Did you give House the moron
with the broken finger?

270
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,392
They've been in room two
about ten minutes.

271
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,328
Patient should've been screaming
for another doctor

272
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:31,697
seven minutes ago.

273
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:37,103
Thanks, Brah.

274
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:51,484
If I have this IV,
why do I need a shot too?

275
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,121
Just some extra medicine.

276
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:58,357
Just to be safe.

277
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:00,359
I hear you're quite
the basketball player.

278
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,427
What position?

279
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:03,095
Point guard.

280
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:04,163
Small forward.

281
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,498
How's your crossover dribble?

282
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,333
It's okay.

283
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:08,968
Not really that into basketball.

284
00:13:09,036 --> 00:13:11,370
Gonna feel a little pinch,
okay?

285
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:17,610
So if you're not that into it,
why did you join the team?

286
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,580
My mom kind of made me do it.

287
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:23,382
My parents were the same way.

288
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,518
Always pushing me
to try new things.

289
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:29,488
It's more like what
she didn't want me to try.

290
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:31,891
I--I wanted to take dance.

291
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,893
She flipped out
and made me choose

292
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,661
between basketball and hockey.

293
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:38,397
What does your dad say?

294
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:40,666
He seemed okay with it.

295
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:42,401
Then he just caved in
to my mom.

296
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:47,506
Your palm is red.

297
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:50,042
What does that mean?

298
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,779
That we still don't know
what's wrong with you.

299
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,153
You were right.

300
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:03,322
<i>He is in a good mood.</i>

301
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:12,765
Bummer it didn't work out
with you and Thirteen.

302
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,367
It happens.

303
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:15,768
You guys seemed happy together.

304
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,203
It's probably for the best.

305
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,004
You know, the bisexual thing
and all.

306
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:20,072
It was never an issue.

307
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,340
No, it never is.

308
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:22,942
Until it is.

309
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:24,443
This is Thirteen.

310
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,578
Before you guys
got together,

311
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:26,946
she was hooking up
with a different girl

312
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,614
every night.

313
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:29,915
Long term, you really think

314
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:34,754
you could compete with that?

315
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:37,356
House, wake up.
We have to talk.

316
00:14:37,424 --> 00:14:39,291
Stop pretending to be asleep.
We're not leaving.

317
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,662
House.

318
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,298
What's going on?

319
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:47,666
House.

320
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:51,637
<i>He's not breathing.
Can you get a pulse?</i>

321
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,672
Barely.
Call a Code.

322
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,141
<i> Get an ambu bag
from the nurse's station.</i>

323
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,009
Heart still working means
synapses are still firing.

324
00:14:57,077 --> 00:15:00,579
We just need to get
a message through.

325
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,081
Aah!

326
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:09,088
You stopped breathing.

327
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:11,524
What the hell is going on?

328
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,794
I think my penis
stopped breathing.

329
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:20,895
Do you know CPR?

330
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,463
Looks like your brain
is okay.

331
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,599
Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive.

332
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,301
I'm fine.

333
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:27,402
Other than the fact

334
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,837
that my nurple is now purple.

335
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:31,105
No wonder you broke up
with him.

336
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:32,340
I'm surprised yours
are still attached.

337
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:33,775
<i>By the way,</i>

338
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:35,310
I could see that from here.

339
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:38,713
I assume those are
our patient's lab results.

340
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:40,148
The patient can wait.
You could've died.

341
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:41,582
The only reason you'd ignore

342
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,051
<i>a near-death experience</i>

343
00:15:43,118 --> 00:15:44,285
is you don't care

344
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:45,553
or you already know
why it happened.

345
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:46,988
It's called Vicodin.

346
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:49,123
I took too many.

347
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,325
Can I please
get some information

348
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:51,526
about our patient?

349
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:52,827
Patient's palms are red.

350
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,929
Lab tests confirmed liver
and kidney dysfunction.

351
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,597
I don't remember you taking
any Vicodin today.

352
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,166
I don't remember hiring
my mother.

353
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,234
<i>What causes the enzymes</i>

354
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:02,303
in little boy George's
existing heart problem

355
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,738
<i>and pelvic pain?</i>

356
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:05,773
You didn't take any yesterday
at breakfast either.

357
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,875
I don't remember having
breakfast with my mother.

358
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:10,044
Amyloidosis
with systemic involvement.

359
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:11,713
<i>Protein levels are normal.</i>

360
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,047
This kid's depressed.

361
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,549
If he's self-medicating
with drugs and alcohol,

362
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:15,917
that'd explain his symptoms.

363
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:17,885
Search the school.
Search the home.

364
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:19,253
Seriously?
Or are you just deflecting?

365
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:21,122
Both.

366
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:25,393
Where are you going?

367
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,794
Nowhere.

368
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,596
I'm staying right here.
So we can properly discuss this.

369
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:33,968
He's on heroin.

370
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,203
How can you--

371
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,471
Number one--

372
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,606
He's happy,
which means he's high.

373
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:40,007
Number two--
when he moved his bad leg,

374
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:41,809
he didn't use his hands
to support it.

375
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,010
Whatever he's taking,

376
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:45,346
it's stronger than Vicodin.

377
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:46,848
What are we gonna do?

378
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:53,221
You really think House
took too many Vicodin?

379
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,156
Guy pops 'em like candy.

380
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:58,059
I'm surprised it hasn't happened
before.

381
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,427
You miss sleeping with women?

382
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:01,729
Excuse me?

383
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,064
Simple question.

384
00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:05,666
Yes.

385
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:06,934
It's a simple answer.

386
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:09,837
I'll...check under the bed.

387
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:15,610
I also miss sleeping
with other men.

388
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:18,279
And I'm sure you miss sleeping
with other women.

389
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:20,948
<i>Monogamy is like saying</i>

390
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:22,383
you're never gonna have

391
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:24,552
any other ice cream flavor
besides rocky road.

392
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,487
<i>So you're saying</i>

393
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,890
if you don't have pink bubblegum
for a while,

394
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:31,025
that one day you're gonna
chase down the ice cream truck?

395
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,727
No.

396
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,595
Rocky road is great.

397
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:40,601
It's a very delicious
and complicated flavor.

398
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:42,103
I also know that if I have
other flavors,

399
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,671
then rocky road is gonna be left
in the freezer

400
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,540
where anyone can just dip in.

401
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:50,144
Can we please drop
the metaphor?

402
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:52,313
<i>Why is this coming up now?</i>

403
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:55,249
Kutner said the silver lining
of our break-up

404
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:57,051
was I wouldn't be dumped
for a girl.

405
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,086
<i>There's nothing in here either.</i>

406
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:00,421
Seems like you're wrong

407
00:18:00,489 --> 00:18:01,789
about this kid having drug
or alcohol--

408
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:02,790
When did he bring that up?

409
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,692
Earlier today.

410
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,893
<i>Right before--</i>

411
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:06,961
This morning Taub called you
a robot.

412
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:09,564
Huh.

413
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,433
Either it's a big coincidence
or...

414
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:13,801
they're jerking us around.

415
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:14,802
They know.

416
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,938
And if they know,

417
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:18,339
<i>House knows.</i>

418
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:19,907
This is bad.

419
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,742
No.

420
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,378
This is good.

421
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:27,582
House only has two ways
to handle us still going out.

422
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,150
He jerks us around
or he fires us.

423
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:31,018
He chose option A.

424
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,553
This is good.

425
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:41,929
But this is bad.

426
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,131
"I stand alone,
my soul and me,

427
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:47,235
beneath the mask
that others...see."

428
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:52,006
His chest is still rising.

429
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,341
He's just screwing with me

430
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:55,810
'cause Cuddy made me babysit.

431
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:58,112
"A pain that tears
and bites

432
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,413
"and will not bend.

433
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:01,249
Only when I sleep
will it end."

434
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:03,551
Downer.

435
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:09,490
You sure his chest is moving?

436
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:11,025
House.

437
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:12,627
If he's faking, you think
he's gonna come clean

438
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,495
'cause you said his name?

439
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:15,563
Back off.

440
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:17,532
<i>Only Thirteen gets</i>

441
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,267
to grab my nipples
this time.

442
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,235
You know, recreating the moment
when you made us

443
00:19:21,303 --> 00:19:24,305
crap our pants isn't actually
all that funny.

444
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,740
That is sweet that

445
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:28,910
you're worried about House.

446
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:32,613
<i>Unless the next stanza reads</i>

447
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:34,015
"Hing to fry my brain
to death,

448
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:37,151
I smoked some primo
crystal meth,"

449
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,619
I'm not interested.

450
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:40,288
You can't deny that this kid
may be suicidal.

451
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:41,522
We're not here
to make him happy.

452
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,690
We're here to diagnose him.

453
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:43,891
It's an infection.

454
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,593
<i>Swab of the kid's water bottle</i>

455
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:46,561
turned up toxoplasmosis.

456
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:49,864
I'll start him on pyrimethamine.

457
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:01,576
I had no idea he felt
this way.

458
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:04,879
Is there a therapist here
that you can recommend?

459
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:06,981
It might help more
if you talked to him.

460
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:10,184
He's not ready.

461
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,719
If telling him the truth

462
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:13,220
would help him stop feeling
like this--

463
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:15,423
If I knew that it would make him
less confused,

464
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,624
I'd tell him right now.

465
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:19,460
<i>But if she's wrong,</i>

466
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:20,828
we'd only make things worse.

467
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:24,565
He obviously senses
he's different.

468
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:26,567
He's looking for answers.

469
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:29,370
Every teenager
feels different.

470
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,306
He's sick.

471
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:34,141
This isn't the time
to spring this on him.

472
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,980
Okay.

473
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,451
When you give Jackson
the antibiotics,

474
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:45,886
will you please restart
the testosterone?

475
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:46,988
Sure.

476
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:53,227
I get House wanting
to jerk me and Thirteen around,

477
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,395
but you guys?

478
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:57,999
Told you they were still
together.

479
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:59,634
How do you know?

480
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:01,836
Noticed you smell like
Thirteen's soap every morning.

481
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:03,571
You figured it out?

482
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,239
Yes, I'm a little slow.

483
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,574
Maybe someone should
let me know

484
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:07,608
when I should be insulted.

485
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:10,211
Then House doesn't know.

486
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:11,946
Probably does now
that you felt her up

487
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:16,651
during that last differential.

488
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:19,186
You noticed this
but House didn't?

489
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:20,721
Yes, I get it.

490
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,623
He's generally smarter than me.

491
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:23,958
Can we please move on?

492
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:24,859
He's not generally smarter
than you.

493
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:27,395
He's always smarter than you.

494
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:30,331
Unless...

495
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:35,336
Hello.

496
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:37,238
House is on heroin.

497
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:43,244
Well, that's certainly
an...interesting notion.

498
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:44,745
It's why his lungs stopped.

499
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:46,047
It's why he okay'd
the MRI.

500
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:47,415
It's why he missed...

501
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:50,351
things he wouldn't
ordinarily miss.

502
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:52,720
Um, we'll run some tests

503
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:54,188
and I'll let you know.

504
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:55,289
<i>He's there, isn't he?</i>

505
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,157
Well, that would certainly
explain

506
00:21:56,224 --> 00:21:57,258
the inappropriate responses.

507
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,126
I--I gotta go.

508
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,062
Okay.

509
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:02,730
Sorry.
A consult.

510
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,199
When did you order these?

511
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:06,767
When you were in the bathroom.

512
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:10,337
I thought a celebration
was in order.

513
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:11,806
To cheating death.

514
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:21,348
You off bourbon?

515
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,550
We can get you something else.

516
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:24,118
I came here expecting
a burger.

517
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:25,853
Figured I'd have to endure

518
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,555
a little lecture
on moderation.

519
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:30,057
You never listen,
so why--

520
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,325
Instead, I get a drink.

521
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:33,160
Nice little serving

522
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,895
of respiratory depressant

523
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:36,564
on the day that my lungs
stopped working.

524
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:38,265
You seem fine now.

525
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,534
You don't believe
that I OD'd on Vicodin.

526
00:22:40,602 --> 00:22:42,670
<i>You figure I'm on something
stronger.</i>

527
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,972
And because you can never,
ever assume anything

528
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,540
but the most screwed-up
scenarios,

529
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:47,575
as far as I'm concerned--

530
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:49,076
Funny how I'm usually right.

531
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:51,812
You think that I'm on heroin.

532
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,714
<i>This is your version
of a tox screen.</i>

533
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:55,416
Because if I am on heroin,

534
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:57,451
I can't drink that
without risking

535
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,554
another bout
of not breathing.

536
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:04,558
Well?

537
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:16,370
Good night.

538
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:24,612
<i>Another shot?</i>

539
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,514
I'm afraid so.

540
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:30,151
That looks like the vitamins
my parents give me.

541
00:23:30,218 --> 00:23:33,854
Same red top.

542
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:44,832
These aren't vitamins.

543
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,167
What is it?

544
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:48,702
I can't tell you that.

545
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,870
You should ask your parents.

546
00:23:56,545 --> 00:23:58,012
<i>You idiot!</i>

547
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,484
Okay, I admit it.

548
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:05,886
I have bulimia.

549
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:06,921
I look good though,
don't I?

550
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,022
Heroin.

551
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:09,557
Heroin!

552
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:11,692
House, of all the stupid--

553
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,928
I'm not on heroin.

554
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,830
I just caught you with
your fingers down your throat.

555
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:16,897
I'm on methadone.

556
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:21,969
Stupid product.

557
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:23,437
Heroin without the high.

558
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,273
Yeah, and twice the risk
of death.

559
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:27,474
But no risk of arrest.

560
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:28,776
You nearly died.

561
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,211
Today was a fluke.
I nodded off.

562
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:31,278
<i>Right.</i>

563
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,713
You're safe as long
as you

564
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:34,315
<i>never sleep again.</i>

565
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:35,416
<i>Mistime your dose,</i>

566
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:36,517
you die.

567
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:37,484
Couple of drinks,
you die.

568
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:38,752
Mix it with the wrong drugs,

569
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,987
<i>you die.</i>

570
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:41,188
<i>You want to detox
from Vicodin?</i>

571
00:24:41,256 --> 00:24:42,890
Pick something that won't
kill you.

572
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:43,924
I'm not detoxing.

573
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,595
If you're looking
for something

574
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:49,063
to help with your pain--

575
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,265
Doesn't help my pain.

576
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,901
It eliminates it.

577
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,713
My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

578
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:15,160
<i>She completely disregarded
our instructions.</i>

579
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:17,362
He asked a question.
I was tired of lying.

580
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,431
I didn't tell him anything
about his genetic condition.

581
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:21,833
I want her removed
from our son's case.

582
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:23,868
I'm sorry for the position

583
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,270
Dr. Hadley put you in,

584
00:25:25,337 --> 00:25:27,872
but I can't do that.

585
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,240
<i>She's a valuable part
of Dr. House's</i>

586
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:30,642
<i>diagnostic team.</i>

587
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,311
If he stays on the case,
so does she.

588
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:35,113
<i>We have to deal with Jackson.</i>

589
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:36,948
These questions
aren't gonna go away.

590
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:38,983
He's not ready for this.

591
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,622
Let's hope you're wrong.

592
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:51,696
I'm sorry. I'll stay away
from their son.

593
00:25:51,764 --> 00:25:53,865
No, you won't.

594
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,567
<i>In about 15 minutes,</i>

595
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:57,135
<i>you're the only person
that kid's gonna trust.</i>

596
00:25:57,203 --> 00:25:58,870
If he needs a hand to hold,

597
00:25:58,938 --> 00:25:59,938
make sure yours
is available.

598
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:10,081
So what?

599
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:12,917
Am I a boy or a girl?

600
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:15,954
Some of your cells are male...

601
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:17,021
and some are female.

602
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:19,023
So basically I'm a freak.

603
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:22,627
No, no, buddy.

604
00:26:22,695 --> 00:26:24,028
You're just a little different.

605
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:29,567
You've known this...

606
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:31,402
Since I was born.

607
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,071
And you never told me.

608
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:34,839
We didn't want you
to be confused.

609
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:36,207
So you lied to me.

610
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:38,376
Oh, please, sweetie,

611
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:39,844
we were just trying
to protect you.

612
00:26:39,912 --> 00:26:42,447
Don't.

613
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:46,084
Just leave me alone.

614
00:26:46,152 --> 00:26:48,019
Get out.

615
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:51,756
Let's go.

616
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:06,805
<i>You still breathing in there?</i>

617
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:08,306
<i>'Cause if not,</i>

618
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:11,242
<i>I'm sending in janitorial.</i>

619
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,443
I'm not breathing.

620
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,012
But it's strictly voluntary.

621
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,147
<i>Should've seen the guy
who was in here before me.</i>

622
00:27:16,215 --> 00:27:17,382
I know about the methadone.

623
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:21,386
It's legal.

624
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:23,121
<i>I have a prescription.</i>

625
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:26,024
Whatever doctor you conned
into writing it

626
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:27,692
<i>clearly had no idea
about your addiction issues.</i>

627
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,160
<i>Your lack of--
he knows I'm in pain.</i>

628
00:27:29,228 --> 00:27:32,063
<i>What I put in my body
is my business.</i>

629
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:34,566
You keep taking this,
you could die.

630
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:36,201
If you'd said that
if I keep doing this

631
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:37,969
<i>you could die,
then it'd be your business.</i>

632
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,774
I can't sit by and watch you
kill yourself.

633
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:44,409
<i>As long as you're
in my hospital,</i>

634
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:45,610
You can't do methadone.

635
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:55,787
I'll send someone
for my stuff.

636
00:27:58,958 --> 00:27:59,924
That's it?

637
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:02,193
<i>You're quitting?</i>

638
00:28:02,261 --> 00:28:04,462
You're choosing methadone
over this job?

639
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,032
I'm choosing lack of pain
over this job.

640
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:21,545
Eventually you have to talk
to your parents again.

641
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,014
No, I don't.

642
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,694
I have this one friend.

643
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,529
He's on my basketball team.
Will.

644
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:41,799
We hang out a lot.

645
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:43,300
I really like him.

646
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:46,637
Now I'm worried that I...

647
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:49,039
<i>you know, like him.</i>

648
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,912
Maybe I'm supposed to.

649
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,350
Because if I'm really a girl...

650
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:02,052
Hmm.

651
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,921
Do you feel like a girl?

652
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:08,025
I like dancing
more than basketball.

653
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:11,328
Is that what that means?

654
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:19,203
Jackson...

655
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:21,906
As hard as it is right now,

656
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:23,774
at least it's out
in the open.

657
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:28,546
You don't have to hide
behind a mask.

658
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:35,152
I found the poem you wrote
in your room.

659
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:40,691
No matter how bad things get,

660
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,428
killing yourself
is never the answer.

661
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,736
This was an English assignment.

662
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:57,174
We were supposed to write
a poem

663
00:29:57,242 --> 00:29:59,376
in the style of Sylvia Plath.

664
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:08,519
You don't feel this way?

665
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:12,356
I'm sad sometimes.

666
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:14,792
I don't want to die.

667
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,428
At least, I didn't.

668
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:29,907
Are these antibiotics
supposed to make you nauseous?

669
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:33,410
Yeah, they can.

670
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,836
# lifting me up
like a garage door #

671
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:02,006
# I need to feel it when
the drug starts coming on #

672
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:05,009
# I know you, lord,
are a jealous lord #

673
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:07,945
# I know the tablet
is your competition #

674
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:11,315
# and I need-- # #

675
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,038
We're on our own.

676
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:14,106
Is he okay?

677
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:15,607
He's fine.
He's just not here.

678
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:16,975
Did he quit?
Did she suspend him?

679
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,143
She didn't say.

680
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,144
She just told me
I was in charge

681
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:21,146
<i>until further notice.</i>

682
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,447
So if we add bloody vomit

683
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:23,849
to our patient's list
of symptoms.

684
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:25,751
Surgeon reports the bleeding
was caused

685
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,119
by a gastric fistula

686
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:28,520
caused by necrotizing
pancreatitis.

687
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:29,888
She must've told you something.

688
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,390
Nothing that would help us
with this patient.

689
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,592
Heart, liver, kidneys,
and pancreas.

690
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,693
Obviously whatever
this kid's got

691
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:37,162
is something systemic.

692
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,665
Zollinger-Ellison?

693
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,633
Or systemic scleroderma.

694
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:43,535
Zollinger-Ellison fits better.

695
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:44,536
Why?

696
00:31:44,604 --> 00:31:45,604
Can we at least call House?

697
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:46,638
<i>We can.</i>

698
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:48,307
I have.
He's not answering.

699
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:50,209
<i>Put the patient
on proton pump inhibitors.</i>

700
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,844
If he gets better,
it's Zollinger-Ellison.

701
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,545
If not, it's scleroderma.

702
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:02,787
Zollinger-Ellison
doesn't fit better.

703
00:32:02,855 --> 00:32:05,223
You don't want it
to be scleroderma

704
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,124
Because that means
he's gonna die.

705
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:08,159
Patients die all the time.

706
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:09,994
Not the ones whose family
you've ruined.

707
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,063
I don't think that.

708
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,733
You do.

709
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
It's not your fault.

710
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,370
He was no more confused
than any other teenager.

711
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,672
Then I started a fire
and threw gas on it.

712
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,241
You were trying to help.

713
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,883
Hi, is House here?

714
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,318
He's getting dressed.

715
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,320
I'll be back around 10:00
tonight.

716
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,424
Go on in.

717
00:32:39,492 --> 00:32:40,458
Okay.

718
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,764
Who was she?

719
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,565
<i>I hired her to watch me sleep.</i>

720
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,267
<i>Make sure I don't stop
breathing.</i>

721
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:52,470
Home nurses usually wear scrubs.

722
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,706
<i>She's not a nurse.</i>

723
00:32:54,774 --> 00:32:57,308
You hired a hooker
to watch you sleep?

724
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:01,379
That just can't--

725
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,548
Surprisingly,
hookers are cheaper.

726
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:05,850
And they don't sue
for sexual harassment.

727
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:07,051
Which one?

728
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,221
You shaved.

729
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,489
The red one then.

730
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,825
<i>You have two ties?</i>

731
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:16,428
Meeting at St. Sebastian's
today.

732
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,196
<i>Gonna try and talk 'em</i>

733
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:20,064
into starting up
a diagnostics department.

734
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,733
Sounds great.

735
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:23,835
<i>I just came by</i>

736
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,136
to check up on you.

737
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,337
See how you were doing.

738
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,841
I'm fine.

739
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:32,544
I guess you are.

740
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,348
He hasn't responded
to the medication at all?

741
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,184
I'm afraid not.

742
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,519
<i>So...</i>

743
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:43,054
That means he's got
the other thing?

744
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:44,589
I'm so sorry.

745
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:47,559
We'll start him
on anti-inflammatories.

746
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,394
<i>If we're lucky,</i>

747
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:51,863
that will slow down
the progression.

748
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,840
My son has a death sentence

749
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,274
and I can't go in there
and be with him

750
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,309
because of you.

751
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,844
I'm sorry.

752
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,278
You find a homework assignment

753
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:08,913
and decide he's suicidal.

754
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:11,883
Make it your own
personal mission.

755
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:12,951
I let my feelings--

756
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:14,919
Oh, don't you dare apologize.

757
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,754
Like it could absolve you

758
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,890
of what you've done to me,
my family.

759
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,625
He was fine.

760
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:22,694
<i>I understand why you're angry.</i>

761
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,963
But this isn't where
you belong right now.

762
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,297
He won't let us
in the room.

763
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,665
He's a teenager.

764
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,400
You're his mother.

765
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,503
This is not the time
to start listening to him.

766
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,706
Go be with him.

767
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:45,950
Thank you.

768
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:47,552
I didn't do it for you.

769
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:55,460
We made a mistake.

770
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:56,761
No, we didn't.

771
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,396
The methadone's good for him.

772
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,331
The methadone
is gonna kill him.

773
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,733
He shaved.

774
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,134
He was wearing a tie.

775
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,736
He has a meeting
at St. Sebastian.

776
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,371
If he buys
a new pair of shoes,

777
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,072
should we let him smoke crack?

778
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,307
Cuddy, he's happy.

779
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,875
House doesn't do happy.

780
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,810
Pain or no pain.

781
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:16,114
Okay, maybe...

782
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,383
but he's our friend.

783
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,787
And this is his one chance
to not be miserable.

784
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,461
The heels.
Very nice.

785
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:48,863
No reason not to wear them

786
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,698
now that House is gone.

787
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,166
You okay?

788
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,034
Yeah.
Just tired.

789
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,736
Got some good news.

790
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:57,371
Patient's scleroderma
is responding

791
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:58,672
to the anti-inflammatory meds.

792
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,307
His AST level's dropped
a bit.

793
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,944
So he's dying slightly
less quickly than we thought.

794
00:36:04,012 --> 00:36:08,182
That's great news.

795
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,050
I'm not okay.

796
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:12,186
Next time just say that.

797
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,225
What's his AST?

798
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:19,660
Uh...185, I think.

799
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:21,529
That's a pretty fast drop.

800
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,730
Are we sure it's from
the anti-inflammatories?

801
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:24,331
What else could it be from?

802
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,432
He's been off the antibiotics
for a while.

803
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,400
Proton pump inhibitor's--

804
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:27,802
He's back on testosterone.

805
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,403
Testosterone wouldn't help
his liver function.

806
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,238
But it could improve
his kidney function

807
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:33,040
which would also lower
his AST.

808
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,109
But not in kidneys damaged
by scleroderma.

809
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:38,345
Which means
it's not scleroderma.

810
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:45,719
I have an interview
in two hours.

811
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,222
Wow.

812
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,658
Hand over my letter
of recommendation.

813
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:52,560
Mm, sorry,
I haven't done it yet.

814
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,429
You have no right
to sabotage--

815
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:56,997
I was busy with this.

816
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,869
It's a list of requirements
for your methadone treatment.

817
00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:04,171
Weekly drug tests.

818
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,539
Supervised doses

819
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:07,575
<i>administered on a precise
schedule by me</i>

820
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,777
or one of the nurses.

821
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:11,979
Seems weird
getting my meds here

822
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:13,214
when I'm working somewhere else.

823
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:16,851
Yes.

824
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:19,353
I'm offering you
your job back.

825
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,123
I want a raise.

826
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,558
No.

827
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:27,294
And a bigger office...
but in the same spot.

828
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:29,997
No.

829
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:34,001
We both know this is where
you belong.

830
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:40,441
Okay.

831
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,410
Welcome back.

832
00:37:48,717 --> 00:37:51,085
Thank you.

833
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:53,354
You're welcome.

834
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,464
You okay?

835
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,667
I have issues with authority.
- You?

836
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:08,669
W-we thought you were gone.

837
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:10,237
Cuddy missed me.

838
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:11,405
And what happened
to your cane?

839
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:14,041
She asked to borrow it
for some reason.

840
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:17,177
Patient dead or do I need
to do anything?

841
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:18,345
He's got scleroderma.

842
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:20,414
It's not scleroderma.

843
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:21,548
Wow.

844
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:23,684
Two days,
and you've already got

845
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:25,319
two separate theories.

846
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,821
You're back. Good.

847
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,290
We noticed a drop
in AST levels.

848
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,258
<i>It's not from
the anti-inflammatory meds.</i>

849
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:32,793
It's because his kidneys got
better from the testosterone.

850
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:34,428
Which rules out scleroderma.

851
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,931
When did you two come up
with this?

852
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,033
We ran into each other
in the lobby.

853
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,470
What did we miss?

854
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:44,471
When I say "we"
I mean "you,"

855
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:45,506
Since I wasn't here.

856
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,041
We've ruled out
Zollinger-Ellison.

857
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:48,642
That was a dumb idea.

858
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,643
Why?

859
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:50,744
Because it was wrong.

860
00:38:50,812 --> 00:38:51,845
<i>Also toxoplasmosis,</i>

861
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,113
dehydration,

862
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:55,683
<i>SLE, various intersex
disorders.</i>

863
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,917
Oh, crap.

864
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:01,789
This kid like energy drinks?

865
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:03,924
I saw some empty bottles

866
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:06,493
<i>in the team locker room.</i>

867
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:07,428
But energy drinks
don't explain--

868
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:08,529
Nice work.

869
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,731
So...we're okay?

870
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:14,868
Why wouldn't we be?

871
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,270
<i>Nice heels.</i>

872
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:25,779
This is all
your parents' fault.

873
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:27,548
Excuse me?

874
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,216
Chug a lot of energy drinks

875
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,152
before, during,
and after practice?

876
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,822
Your son came in here
with simple dehydration.

877
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,124
That's why he collapsed
during the game.

878
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:38,459
The ER treated him for that.

879
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:39,560
<i>It didn't help the pain.</i>

880
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,095
That's where the energy drinks
came in.

881
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:42,730
They put a strain
on his kidneys

882
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,864
so he needed more time
to rebound

883
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:45,032
from the initial dehydration.

884
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,633
Then why isn't he better?

885
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:48,702
That's where your idiocy
came in.

886
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,505
<i>Before we could give him
another glass of water,</i>

887
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:53,440
you two insisted I do an MRI.

888
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:56,543
<i>So I go down a blind alley</i>

889
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:58,379
looking for a blind uterus.

890
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:00,781
And my team injects him
with contrast material.

891
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:03,250
If his kidneys
had been healthy,

892
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,351
they would've filtered out
the contrast

893
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:05,786
in a couple hours.

894
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:08,322
Since they weren't,
they went around and around.

895
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,623
Eventually getting absorbed
by his heart,

896
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:11,025
his liver,
and his pancreas,

897
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:12,993
getting in trouble
everywhere it went.

898
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:15,562
Your son was fine
when he got here.

899
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,732
It was your freaked-out
overprotectiveness

900
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,767
that nearly killed him.

901
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,935
Nearly?

902
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,604
He's young.

903
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,806
<i>A few weeks of dialysis,</i>

904
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:29,243
<i>he should be fine.</i>

905
00:40:35,283 --> 00:40:37,851
You gave birth
to a freak of nature.

906
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:40,754
Doesn't mean it's a good idea
to treat him like one.

907
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,968
How you feeling?

908
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,637
A little bit better.

909
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,273
I saw you talking
to your parents earlier.

910
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,641
That's good.

911
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,143
My mom asked if I wanted
to take dance lessons.

912
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,679
That's great.

913
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:07,648
I'm actually worried
I might miss basketball.

914
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,217
Starting to get good.

915
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:11,452
There's no reason
you can't do both.

916
00:41:32,674 --> 00:41:33,941
Starting tomorrow,

917
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,275
you'll come to my office
for your fix.

918
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:39,513
I'm done with the methadone.

919
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,948
I screwed up.

920
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:43,917
The kids' parents wanted
that MRI.

921
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:45,085
I knew he didn't need it.

922
00:41:45,153 --> 00:41:46,653
I did it anyway.

923
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:49,790
That's what got him sick.

924
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:51,792
You just solved a case
that no one else could solve.

925
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,594
I created a case.

926
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:57,598
I played nice because
I was in a good mood

927
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,433
because I didn't hurt.

928
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:01,969
You don't need your pain
to be a good doctor.

929
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:03,303
I'm not interested in good.

930
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:04,605
You're afraid to be happy.

931
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:07,174
Why do you care
if I'm happy?

932
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,283
You're afraid of change.

933
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:18,819
The one thing you have
is your intellect.

934
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:20,687
You think if that's compromised,
you have nothing.

935
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:28,595
Just take it.

936
00:42:28,663 --> 00:42:30,531
No.

937
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:32,032
Don't do this.

938
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,102
It's already done.

939
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:40,908
This is the only me you get.

9999
