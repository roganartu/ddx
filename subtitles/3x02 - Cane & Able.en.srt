66

He gets depressed,
he stops exercising.

67
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,466
He stops exercising,
the muscle atrophies.

68
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,187
The muscle atrophies,
the pain returns.

69
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:28,271
Maybe he stopped exercising
because the giant hole
in his leg actually hurts.

The ketamine
could work perfectly,

a tiny nick in your forearm,

00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,773
Then I'm gonna time how long
it takes for you
to stop bleeding.

00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:40,817

a little, so you might
wanna look the other way.

No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?

119
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:03,555

122
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,879

123
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,801
Let me see. Lean forwards.

124
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:15,765

other thing, and they put it
in between these two ribs,

125
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:20,208
always on this side,
and then they move it
around my insides.

126
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:21,329

found the chip back there,

00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:57,358
His alien-abduction story,
the level of detail is...

138
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,039
Well, I don't know
where he gets it from.

139
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:01,441
The parents say he doesn't
watch sci-fi. He doesn't read
comic books...

140
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:04,003
Great. You do any
of that medical stuff
we talked about?

141
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,885
Upper and lower endoscopies
were clean.

142
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,526
So it's a simple
bleeding disorder.

143
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,448
No, blood tests are
all normal, and he
clotted in six minutes.

144
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:14,171
So it's a simple
bleeding disorder, and you
screwed up the test.

145
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:16,173
I didn't screw up the test.

146
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:20,456
So it's a UFO.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.

147
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:24,420
Either you screwed up
the test, or I screwed up
my analysis of this case.

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,142
If you screwed up,
I don't have to
cry myself to sleep.

How could I screw up
a simple bleeding-time test?

00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,469
Maybe you were abducted,
lost time.

154
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:50,961
I had to stop the bleeding
myself after 25 minutes.

155
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:55,164
So you're saying
Chase did screw up.

156
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,447
Or Foreman screwed up.

157
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,969
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.

158
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:04,291
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playing the dozens.

159
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,413
You're at a huge cultural
disadvantage here, Chase.

160
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,295
Take a couple of minutes
to think of a witty retort.

161
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,096
So we have contradicting
bleeding-time tests.

162
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:13,299
If we run labs to check
his clotting factors, we can
confirm which one's right.

163
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,860
Yeah, testing. Nice idea.

164
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,382
Way better than trying
to guess which doctor's
incompetent.

165
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:19,183
Looks better
in the paperwork, too.

00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:52,490
Oh, no! You take
Alpha Centauri, Foreman
can look on Tatooine,

172
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,773
and Cameron can set up
an intergalactic checkpoint.

173
00:11:56,453 --> 00:11:59,976
Let's pray he hasn't gone
into hyperdrive.
We'll never catch him.

174
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:02,418
(GRUNTING)

175
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,862
Clancy?

176
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,866
I had to go where there are
no windows so I could get
the chip out like you said.

177
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,026
God.

178
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,349
I can feel it.
I just can't grab it.

179
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,431
Clancy, stop.
There is no chip.

180
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:24,396
We're gonna clean you up,
and we're gonna go back
to your room.

181
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:27,758
You can't do things like this.
Your parents...

182
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,091
(SIGHS)

183
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:50,576
Results came back.
The lab cannot identify
the metal.

184
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:53,339
Said it might not
even be terrestrial.

185
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:54,500
Really?

186
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,863
No, you idiot, it's titanium,
like from a surgical pin,

187
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:02,026
like the kind the kid
had inserted into his
broken arm four years ago.

188
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:03,147
Nice medical history.

189
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:04,748
That pin was removed
six months...

190
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:07,390
So a little piece broke off
during removal.

191
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,833
Titanium is used to
build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.

192
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,634
<i>Tell that to the guys
on the Kursk.</i>

193
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:15,877
And how exactly
did it get from his arm
to the back of his neck?

194
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,678
Body attacks
any foreign object.

195
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:21,401
Inflammatory reaction
could erode it into a vein.
Fragment gets a free ride.

196
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:24,003
To his lungs maybe,
not his neck.

197
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:26,886
Yeah, an alien chip
makes more sense.

198
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,769
The real mystery is
that you didn't actually
screw up.

199
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:32,890
You okay?

200
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,772
Fine. Tripped.

201
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:37,894
Kid carved a hole
in the back of his neck.

202
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:40,576
Apparently didn't bleed
to death. Now that's weird.

203
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:42,298
He clotted on his own?

204
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:43,619
Sure did.

205
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,422
So first there was no
bleeding disorder. Then there
was. Now there's not again.

206
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:48,743
Which is impossible.

207
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:50,985
Or Foreman screwed up.

208
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:53,267
Two out of three tests
agree with my findings.

209
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:56,269
Lucky for us,
the fourth test
will be the charm.

210
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:02,474
So you're just gonna
keep cutting him? Until what?

211
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,036
This test is different.

212
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:08,759
We'll draw some blood, and see
if any clotting factors
are low or missing.

213
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,281
But why haven't
the other tests...
We've got three results.

214
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:13,523
They haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.

215
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,044
Or two of them.

216
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:20,488
Is it possible
the problem isn't his blood?
It's just psychological?

217
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:23,331
I mean,
he almost killed himself.

218
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:25,532
He wasn't trying
to hurt himself.

219
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:29,696
No, he was just looking
for an alien tracking device.

220
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,059
I have time for one more.

221
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,821
Can't blame you
for spending extra time
down here.

222
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:40,344
I heard the Artist
Formerly Known as Gimp
is back upstairs.

223
00:14:40,424 --> 00:14:41,825
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.

224
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:43,827
She's busy. I'll take it.

225
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,672
Oh, my God! You're...

226
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:53,074
You're okay!

227
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:54,436
Have we met?

228
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:56,237
I was one of your doctors.

229
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:58,559
You were in a vegetative state
when you left here last week.

230
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,520
Addison's disease.

231
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,564
All I needed was cortisol,
and my brain turned on
like a switch.

232
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:06,926
This is amazing!

233
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,207
Surprised you didn't know.

234
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:10,488
How would I know?

235
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,690
Not quite my old self yet.

236
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,772
Baby steps,
the doctors tell me. Now...

237
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:18,054
With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?

238
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:21,137
How would I...
I wanna have sex with my wife,

239
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:24,740
and I was hoping that
maybe you could...

240
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,302
Viagra?
You're here for Viagra?

241
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:29,784
A bucketful would be nice.

242
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,828
Dr. Cuddy.

243
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:36,870
Hi.

244
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,555
It's completely unethical.

245
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:44,796
He was reckless
with a patient.

246
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:46,797
He was right.
But he didn't know that.

247
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:48,719
He needs at least
some glimmer of humility.

248
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,880
Why does he need that?

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,763
Because other people
have that? Why does he need
to be like other people?

250
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,404
He needs to be less reckless.

251
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:56,845
Well, you did it.

252
00:15:56,886 --> 00:16:00,969
He's dismissing symptoms,
looking for easy solutions.
He's in pain.

253
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,010
How much pain?
Why?

254
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,094
You know this is
affecting him, don't you?

255
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,778
Telling him that he got
his last case right won't do
anything to help him.

256
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:15,020
It'll make him less depressed.
Which might not help his leg.

257
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,902
But you don't know.

258
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:19,424
Just let me run a PET scan

259
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:22,506
on his parietal thalamic area
to see if it's sensing pain.

260
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:26,309
If it is, the ketamine isn't
working anymore, and he's
headed for a huge crash.

261
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:31,153
If it's not,
the leg pain is my fault,
and I will tell him the truth.

262
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:38,879
Too tight?

263
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,281
My parents think I'm crazy.

264
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:42,802
No, they don't.

265
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:44,283
They're just worried
about you. That's all.

266
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:45,845
I'm not weird.

267
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:49,087
It's just that weird things
keep happening to me.

268
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:50,528
Slight pinch.

269
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,653
If you make me better,
do you think the aliens
will leave me alone?

270
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,376
I don't think they're gonna be
bothering you for much longer.

271
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:00,536
Are you lying again?

272
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:01,617
No.

273
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,260
We figure this out,
everything's gonna be okay.

275
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,109
Still with us?

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,550
(GASPING)

277
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:21,793
NURSE: Let's go.

278
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:27,198
CHASE: Pulmonary edema,
stage-two hypertensive crisis.

279
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:28,959
What is happening?
Wait outside.

280
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,002
Get him oxygen, and start him
on an IV drip
of sodium nitroprusside.

281
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,323
Get them outside!

282
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:37,086
He's in ICU, systolic is
hovering around 170.

283
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:40,568
I left instructions to
lower it slowly so we don't
risk hypoperfusing his organs.

284
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,651
Trade-off being that leaving
his blood pressure
that high risks stroke,

285
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,932
MI and blindness.

286
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:46,653
I'm open to suggestions.

287
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:50,697
Solve the case.
Kidneys could explain...
Kidneys are clean.

288
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:53,779
Tell me
he's a mutant-human hybrid.

289
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,340
It is a bleeding disorder.

290
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,022
Clancy tested positive
for Von Willebrand's.

291
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:00,424
I didn't screw up.

292
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:03,547
How could he clot on his own
two out of three times?

293
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:08,431
Maybe he cheated.
CHASE: Right.

294
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:10,592
Kids always cheat
on their bleeding-time tests.

295
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:14,075
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.

296
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:17,278
I have no idea what you
meant, but I could smell
what The Rock was cooking.

297
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:20,881
I meant, he's clotting
right now, and he's
in hypertensive crisis.

298
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:22,242
Maybe the two are related.

299
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:24,804
What if he was hypertensive
the other two times
that he clotted?

300
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:27,806
Hypertensive crisis
can activate clotting factors.

301
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:30,889
Even someone low
on Von Willebrand's
could theoretically clot.

302
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:33,251
And the first time
Clancy clotted,
he was all worked up

303
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:36,373
recounting his alien
abduction. He could've
easily been hypertensive.

304
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:39,576
I know I get worked up
when I cut microchip tracking
implants out of my neck.

305
00:18:39,656 --> 00:18:40,897
Sounds like a cheat to me.

306
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:42,818
Yeah, we get it.

307
00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:45,260
Okay, what's the differential
for a seven-year-old boy

308
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,782
suffering multiple
hypertensive crises?

309
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,267
We think the problem is
in your son's heart.

310
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:56,829
We need to do a procedure
called a transesophageal echo.

311
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,271
Okay, and that will
fix his heart?

312
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:03,515
That will tell us where
the problem is, hopefully.
Then we can fix him.

313
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,404
Listen, this isn't
really part of my job,

314
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:19,408
but he's worried that
you think he's crazy.

315
00:19:19,848 --> 00:19:21,409
Well, isn't he?

316
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,332
There are still plenty
of other explanations
for what's going on.

317
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:31,417
It's important he knows
you believe in him,
even if you don't.

318
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:38,623
FOREMAN: It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.

319
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:43,147
Why don't I have
a high-def in my office?
I'm a department head.

There are
no structural defects.
Valves are intact.

impossible when the pixels
are the size of Legos.

See, this is what
I'm talking about.

Foreman, you gotta
steal this thing for me.

324
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:57,918
Let me ring up
one of the homies.

325
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:01,922
The clearer the image, the
clearer it is that there are
no masses, no clots, no tears.

326
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:04,203
The problem's gotta be
somewhere else.

327
00:20:05,524 --> 00:20:07,686

a bigger boat.

You're wrong, House.

330
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,536
Think he'll make us
break into the IMAX
before he admits it?

331
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:21,257
There.
Where?

Right there.

We don't have a laser pointer.
Well, why not?

337
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:38,431
Who's gonna take us seriously
if we don't have
a laser pointer?

338
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:41,033
Right here.

339
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:44,916
A few thousand myocytes
not beating with the rest.

340
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:47,198
So you've found an arrhythmia?

341
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:49,680
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhtyhmia.

342
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,282
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.

343
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:56,045
Go get me those myocytes.
I wanna talk to them
in my office.

344
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,529
How's the kid doing?

345
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,532
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.

346
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:08,175
Most of it, anyway.

347
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:11,617
Why do they bother
putting age restrictions
on these things

348
00:21:11,657 --> 00:21:14,460
when all you have to do
is click, "Yes, I am 18?"

349
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,821
Even a 17-year-old
can figure that out.

350
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,823
What's going on with the leg?

351
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:22,146
First, tell me
what's going on
with the boobs.

352
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:24,868
If you're feeling pain...
They're firmer.

353
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,870

354
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,751
I wanna get a PET scan

355
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,992
I think it's hormones.

356
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:32,434
As long as there's
no increased activity
in the thalamus...

357
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:35,236
Looks to me like those
puppies are going into
the dairy business.

358
00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:40,000
...then the pain can be good.
It could be
muscle regenerating.

359
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,922
After you workout,
you get sore. Pain doesn't
mean the ketamine failed.

I need to get a PET scan
of your brain.

You're in denial.

00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,092
No, I'm not!

can become mutated.

for this kid's alien DNA.

396
00:23:36,173 --> 00:23:39,295
We could search his home
for toxins,
fungals and radiation.

397
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,178
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with strep,

398
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:45,701
we don't conduct a search
to see which classmate
he got it from. We cure it.

399
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:48,263
We know he's got the stuff
inside him. Let's get
a scalpel and cut it out.

400
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,144
Where do we cut?
Chances are,
it's not just in his heart.

401
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:52,506
Well, we got lucky
with the heart.
Myocytes contract.

402
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:54,588
We could see that
these weren't working.

I don't know how the hell
we're gonna find it
anywhere else.

404
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:03,795
What if we take
the heart cells with the bad
DNA, and we tag them?

405
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:07,278
Can you phrase that
in the form of a metaphor?

406
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:09,239
It's the same way
we search for cancer.

407
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:12,442
The bad DNA creates
a unique protein on the
surface of the affected cells.

408
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:15,044
We create an antibody
that recognizes
only that protein,

409
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:17,886
we flush it throughout
his system,
and the similar cells light up

410
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:20,328
like light bulbs.

411
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,412
Okay, let's do that.

412
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,021
You have to tell him.

413
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,182
He said he wasn't in any pain.

414
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:39,424
He's lying.
Of course he's lying.

415
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:40,745
We need another plan.

416
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:42,226
Don't talk about it that way.

417
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,307
What way?

418
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:44,868
"Plan."

419
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:47,430
It sounds like we're
conspiring against him.
I'm gonna tell him.

420
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,113
No, you're not.
Then come up with
a cunning plan and fast.

421
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:58,559
She's not nearly
as delightful
as she thinks she is.

Makes a lot of noise,

00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:06,525
and it's gonna help us
figure out
what's wrong with you.

425
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:08,927
You think House
has lost a step?

426
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,769
He's fine.

427
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,213
There. Clump of affected cells
in the bone marrow
of the femur.

428
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,934
Explains the
intermittent-bleeding
disorder.

429
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:21,417
'Cause I don't need to
subject myself to House's
torture if there's no upside.

430
00:25:21,497 --> 00:25:23,539
I'm telling you, he's fine.

431
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:28,303
We missed some
affected cells in his heart.

432
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:30,584

hypertensive issues.

433
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:33,267
You said the last case
really threw him,
and now suddenly...

434
00:25:33,387 --> 00:25:34,468
I was wrong.

435
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:37,670
So you changed your mind. Why?

436
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:42,274
His brilliant ideas
on this case
have all been yours.

437
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:44,876
There's the reason for him
needing glasses.

438
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,678
Apparently, it's a symptom.
It means
the condition predates...

439
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:51,321
You don't change your mind
without a reason.
Now, what do you know?

440
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:58,287
House didn't blow
the last case.

441
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:02,330
Cuddy cured the guy
using House's idea.

442
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,452
Cuddy and Wilson
are trying to teach him
some humility.

443
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:12,098
Scan is complete.
Three hot spots,
but nothing in his brain.

444
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:16,581

00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:24,788
STEPHANIE: "Functional"?
What does that mean?

448
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:27,950
He'll be able to walk,
but not run?
He'll have a limp?

449
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,472
If everything goes well,
he'll walk. He'll run.

450
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:32,954
He'll probably be
even stronger than he is now.

451
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:37,278
<i>When we close him up,
we'll move over
to his other leg,</i>

452
00:26:37,358 --> 00:26:40,721
<i>snake a catheter up through
the femoral artery
and into his heart.</i>

453
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,363
<i>Once the affected areas
are removed,</i>

454
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:46,125
his normal tissue
will step back in, do its job.

00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,887
He should have
no more problems
with his blood pressure.

456
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:53,091

are clear, we'll start
the final procedure.

459
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:09,824
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?

460
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:11,785
Yeah, it's clear.

461
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,668
You can throw away
your glasses. We got it all.

462
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:17,710
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.

463
00:27:18,911 --> 00:27:20,232

464
00:27:32,522 --> 00:27:34,404
Do you wanna go for a run?

465
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:36,325
What do you want?

466
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,686
I want you to run.

467
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:45,452
When did you become
an enabler?

468
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:47,454
I'm enabling you to exercise.

469
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:49,976
Vicodin blocks the pain,
you get through your rehab,

470
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:52,018
muscle strength increases,
and pain decreases.

471
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:56,101
I'd rather not become
dependent on pain pills
to get through my day.

472
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,584
You're just like
any other patient,

473
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:03,547
running away from knowledge
that won't make you happy.

474
00:28:03,587 --> 00:28:05,508
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.

475
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:08,030
You're scared
the ketamine treatment's
wearing off,

476
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:11,353
that it was just
a torturous window
to the good life.

477
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:13,675
What part of "poop"
didn't you understand?

478
00:28:13,755 --> 00:28:16,517
How can you be so sure
it isn't just a sore muscle?

479
00:28:16,597 --> 00:28:19,600
It's my leg.
We've known each other
a long time.

480
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:27,366
You're not always right,
House.
You've proven that lately.

481
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:03,203
STEPHANIE:
What's happening to him?

482
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:04,524
He's seizing.
I need clonazepam.

483
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:08,127
I thought you got it all.
Yeah, yell at me.
That'll fix your kid.

484
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:14,932
Obviously, we missed some
foreign tissue. There's
something still in him.

485
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:18,935
The hallucinations and
seizures indicate problems
in the temporal lobe.

486
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:22,818
Sorry, House,
it is neurological.
Looks like you're wrong again.

487
00:30:22,898 --> 00:30:26,341
We didn't miss anything.
Brain scan was
completely clean.

488
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:34,468
Our tag must not have
penetrated
the blood-brain barrier.

489
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:38,351
Don't use an IV this time.
Get it right into the brain.

490
00:30:47,158 --> 00:30:52,442
No cells are lighting up.
His brain is clean.
It is not neurological.

491
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:57,646
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be
neurological.

492
00:30:57,686 --> 00:31:01,489
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.

493
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:06,733
What if it is there,
but didn't show up
on the scan?

494
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:09,135
What if the tag
just doesn't work
in his brain?

495
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:12,698
Brain cells are
structurally different,
express a different protein.

496
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:14,740
So how do we find it?

497
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:20,384
Where are we going?

498
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,386
I am going to think.

499
00:31:57,694 --> 00:31:59,135
Send the kid home.

500
00:31:59,255 --> 00:32:01,137
What do you mean?

501
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:04,660
Make sure his blood pressure's
stabilized, and send him home.

502
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,621
What, like nothing
ever happened?

503
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:08,743
We cured his
bleeding disorder,

504
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:11,705
removed all the damaged cells
we could find.

505
00:32:11,785 --> 00:32:14,307
We don't know that
we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.

506
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:16,829
Maybe these symptoms
come and go
like the blood disorder.

507
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,311
It's more probable that his
remaining symptoms are

508
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:21,994
just a nightmare.

509
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:23,395
He had a convulsion.

510
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,998
May be epilepsy.
May be psychological.
May be nothing.

511
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:30,000
If the kid gets sick again,
it'll give us another clue.

512
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,963
We can start searching again.
If he doesn't, doesn't matter.

513
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,685
Send him home.

514
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:41,729
(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE STARTS)

515
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:44,892
House.

516
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:50,416
You're just giving up
on this kid?

517
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:53,379
You gotta know when to stop.

518
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:55,941
You don't stop.
You never stop.

519
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:59,864
You just keep on going
until you come up with
something so insane

520
00:32:59,864 --> 00:33:01,105
that it's usually right.

521
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,347
Except on my last case.

522
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:07,910
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.

523
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:11,513
This kid obviously
has something wrong with him.

524
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:16,117
When did you develop
such strong opinions
about my patients?

525
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:18,239
Last week,
you were convinced
my patient wasn't sick.

526
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,680
Now you're convinced
this one is.

527
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,283
This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.

528
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:27,486
Just get together
with your team,
spend a few extra hours...

529
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:30,809
Well, I guess we could
amputate his left leg. That's
where we found most of it.

530
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:33,050
Maybe we should just
remove his affected eye
completely.

531
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:35,773
If you have reason
to believe that
that might help...

532
00:33:35,853 --> 00:33:38,575
I'm not gonna start
lopping off body parts,

533
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:41,938
but it's interesting
that you give me
the green light.

534
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:44,380
I just want you
to do something.

535
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,742
You've been overly supportive
this entire week.

536
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:51,505
Either you're hormonal,
or you're guilt-ridden,

537
00:33:51,585 --> 00:33:53,787
and it's too early
in the pregnancy
for this to be hormonal.

538
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:56,830
I'm not pregnant.
Then what did you do wrong?

539
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:08,799
He had Addison's.
Your last patient.
You were right.

540
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:14,924
I gave him one shot of
cortisol and he woke up
like Rip van Winkle.

541
00:34:15,404 --> 00:34:16,525
(SCOFF)

542
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:23,050
Oh, your mommy is in
such trouble.
She's such a liar.

543
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:27,374
That's why you don't have
a daddy.
That's why she had to...

544
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,504
How does one person
end up with two different
sets of DNA?

545
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:40,985
We've been through this.

546
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:42,906
Our assumptions are faulty.

547
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:45,829
We've confirmed two different
sets of DNA.
We re-ran the sequence.

548
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,392
I didn't say the lab work
was faulty. I said
our assumptions were faulty.

549
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,353
We assumed he's a person.

550
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:55,316
Of course. The aliens
didn't just visit him.
They replaced him.

551
00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:59,720
You're being silly. What if
he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?

552
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,922
I'm not getting the metaphor.
No metaphor.

553
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:05,204
Chase, you said the mom
used in vitro fertilization,
right?

554
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:06,605
Yeah, they had trouble
conceiving.

555
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:08,127
Kid was right all along.

556
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:11,209
He was implanted with
something,
back when he was young.

557
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,611
I mean really young,
like 12-cells young.

558
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:16,333
In vitro increases
the likelihood of twinning.

559
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:17,574
But he doesn't have a twin.

560
00:35:17,654 --> 00:35:19,496
Not walking around.

561
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,298
But in vitro fertilization
costs around 25 grand a pop,

562
00:35:22,378 --> 00:35:25,581
so doctors implant two
to six embryos to make sure
you get your money's worth.

563
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:29,223
<i>Problem is, there's not
always enough bedrooms
for all the kiddies.</i>

564
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:31,345
<i>Two brothers get stuck
sharing. There's no bunk beds,</i>

565
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:34,548
<i>so they cuddle up
to keep warm,
and they never untangle.</i>

566
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,590
He's two people in one.

567
00:35:38,951 --> 00:35:41,113
It's called chimerism.

568
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:46,958
Unfortunately, his brother's
like a bad doubles partner.

569
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,720
The guy just takes up space,
gets in the way.

570
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,962
Clancy's body thinks
that he's gonna put away
the easy winners.

571
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:55,965
His brother just keeps
swatting balls into the net.

572
00:35:56,725 --> 00:35:59,127
We gotta get him
off the court.

573
00:35:59,528 --> 00:36:03,651
So does that mean that
you can find the bad cells
in his brain or not?

574
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:08,054
Sure, abandon the metaphor.
Fine.

575
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:12,658
Clancy thinks differently
than his brother
because he thinks.

576
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:14,620
If we induce
an alien abduction...

577
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,181
Wait. What the hell
are you talking about?

578
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:19,063
The foreign DNA has got to
be in a portion of your
son's brain

579
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,185
that makes him believe
that he's being abducted.

580
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:23,587
If we stimulate those neurons
with an electric probe,

581
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:26,309
we can trick
your son's brain
into hallucinating.

582
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:30,913
Your son's neurons will
light up, and his brother's
cells will remain dark.

583
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:32,754
Those are the ones we cut out.

584
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,236
You're talking about
brain surgery.

585
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:39,840
I'm talking about
really cool brain surgery.
One of your sons will die,

586
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,962
but the taller one
won't be so annoying anymore.

587
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:45,845
So I have a twin?

588
00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:48,367
Not really.
What's on the card?

589
00:36:48,447 --> 00:36:49,528
A light bulb.

590
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:51,369
Start us out at 10.

591
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:58,054
I'm not doing that.

592
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,736
That was all me, kid. Sorry.

593
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:03,499
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.

594
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:05,260
He lives inside me?

595
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,461
Sort of.

596
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:11,065
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.

597
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,107
You're in sensory.
You're getting closer.

598
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:14,267
What do you see on this one?

599
00:37:14,348 --> 00:37:15,989
Moon and stars.

600
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,873
So I am kind of weird?

601
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:23,715
We're all kind of weird.

602
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,119
No!

603
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:30,240
Clancy?
We got something.

604
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,202
What do you see?
The light.

605
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:34,884
Here they come, I think.

606
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:38,087
Brain waves indicate
a mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.

607
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:40,208
Any dark spots?
Area's too fuzzy.

608
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:41,729
Hallucination isn't
strong enough.

609
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:43,411
Turn up the juice.

610
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:47,974
His blood pressure's already
160 over 110. Any higher...

611
00:37:48,095 --> 00:37:52,138
Riding the short bus
is better than not breathing.
Take us to 100.

612
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:59,464
Area's still too fuzzy
to make any kind of
distinction.

613
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:01,425
Crank it up higher.
You've already exceeded

614
00:38:01,465 --> 00:38:04,748
the preset maximum.
Next step's brain damage.

615
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:16,037
They're gonna get you.
They're coming
through the walls.

616
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:20,400
They're gonna take you,
torture you. You'll never
see your parents again.

618
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:45,260
Clancy? Can you hear me?

619
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:47,462
Clancy?

620
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:54,307
You got them.

621
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,231
Yep.

622
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,273
We got them all.

623
00:39:01,393 --> 00:39:03,235
Close him up.

624
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:05,637
Everything's gonna be
normal again.

625
00:39:17,446 --> 00:39:20,048
You believe what
Cuddy tried to pull?

626
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:22,130
What now?

627
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,891
She lied to me.

628
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:27,454
She cured my patient
with my diagnosis,
then lied to me about it.

629
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:29,095
That doesn't sound like her.

630
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:30,697
You're right.

631
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:34,059
Does sound like you, though.

632
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:40,224
What exactly did
Cuddy tell you?

633
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:43,867
Nothing that your
body language
isn't telling me right now.

634
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:48,151
So what was the plan?

635
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:55,036
I'd feel so humbled by
missing a case that
I'd reevaluate my entire life,

636
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:58,399
question the nature of truth
and goodness
and become Cameron?

637
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,442
Something like that.
More that if we told you
the truth,

638
00:40:02,522 --> 00:40:07,326
that you solved a case
based on absolutely
no medical proof,

639
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,287
you'd think you were God.

640
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:13,651
And I was worried
your wings would melt.

641
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:18,695
God doesn't limp.
