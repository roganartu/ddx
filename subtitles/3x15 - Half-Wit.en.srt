Twenty-five years ago,
Patrick was in
the fourth grade,

played Little League

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,920

was the accident.

Dystonia's not
life threatening.

36
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,260
Clonazepam will
take care of it.

He's already on clonazepam

There is no case, House.

47
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,380
Even if dystonia was some
big medical mystery,
it's not this time.

48
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,100
You're not intrigued
as to how a perfectly
healthy 10-year-old boy

musical training
gets into an accident

play the piano?

That's a yes.

Savantism is just
one of those things.

56

It's inexplicable.

57
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Just because it's inexplicted
doesn't mean
it's inexplicable.

It's a compensation mechanism.

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,780
He knows he's supposed
to say something

69
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,660
so he repeats
what he's just heard.

There was
construction on Radcliffe.

out of the car

with more important things,

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,100
You've been here?

181
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,780
Where else would
the bedroom be?

182
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,620
Come with?

183
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,500
You're scared of
him catching us
breaking into his home

184
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,740
but you're not
scared of him catching us
doing it in his bed?

185
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,580
If I'm gonna get
fired anyway...

186
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,500
Almost at the heart.
Ablating and done.

187
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,980
Heart rate's 160.
It's accelerating.

188
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,260
He's at 210!

189
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,780
He's in
supraventricular tachycardia.

190
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,260
Paddles!

191
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,580
Charging.

192
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,700
Clear!

193
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,620
We're wasting our time.

194
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,940
His high-school yearbook.

195
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,220
Unless you think
he's going to Boston

196
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,420
to attend
a high-school reunion,

197
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,260
put it back and
let's get out of here
before he comes home.

198
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,660
He's not smiling.

199
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,460
CHASE:
I wonder if he has teeth.

200
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,820
What's the area
code for Boston?

201
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,420
617, why?

202
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,500
<i>WOMAN ON PHONE.:
Massachusetts General.
May I help you?</i>

203
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,140
Did you think you could steal
Dr. House without a fight?

204
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,260
<i>MEDAK ON PHONE.:
Steal him for what?</i>

205
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,060
Quit jerking me around.
I know he's coming out there.

206
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,500
<i>We're not
looking to hire him.</i>

207
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,220
He's called you six times
in the last month.

208
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,540
<i>We're not
looking to hire him.</i>

209
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,660
You think if you
keep repeating it,
I'll start believing you?

210
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,420
<i>Dr. Cuddy, there's
nothing else I can say.</i>

211
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,140
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

212
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,860
If he's not coming there
for a job interview,

213
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,420
he's either coming
to your hospital

214
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,980
for a social visit or
because he's a patient.

215
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,180
Is it a social visit,
Dr. Medak?

216
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,140
<i>I can't stand House.</i>

217
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,020
<i>Neither can Dr. Coopersmith.</i>

218
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,700
What's up?

219
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,060
Do you know a
Dr. Coopersmith in Boston?

220
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,340
Yeah. He's an oncologist.

221
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,340
What's up?

222
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,820
What's his subspecialty?

223
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,420
Brain cancer.

224
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,180
What's going on?

225
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,380
CUDDY: He doesn't look sick.

226
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,900
He should have symptoms.

227
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,460
Blurred vision, headaches,
confusion, clumsiness.

228
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,340
Depends how far
along the cancer is.

229
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,100
What kind, how aggressive.

230
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,860
He didn't tell you?

231
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,940
House is House.

232
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,220
He's no different
than anyone else with cancer.

233
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,860
Once you tell,
then every conversation
is about that.

234
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,340
FOREMAN: Cardiac arrest
means we were wrong.

235
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,820
There was a heart problem.

236
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,300
But no vasoconstriction.

237
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,140
The heart problem
couldn't have
caused the hand problem.

238
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,580
Unless the bleed
happened suddenly.

239
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
Less blood to the brain
explains the dystonia.

240
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,820
Less blood to the heart
explains the heart attack.

241
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,340
Scope him above and below.

242
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,260
If that doesn't work,
gut him.

243
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,580
Can't you sedate him?

244
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,660
There's a risk his
throat could collapse.

245
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,140
You look mad, Papa.

246
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,700
No.

247
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,900
No, I'm not mad.
I promise you.

248
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,300
It's just that the doctor
has to do something
to you and it's...

249
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,700
And it's gonna hurt.

250
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,220
Hurt me? Why hurt me?

251
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,820
Make you better.

252
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,660
What's wrong with me?

253
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,820
Well, they don't know.

254
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,780
Patrick, don't you worry.

255
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,380
Everything is gonna be great.

256
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,700
All right.
Here we go, Patrick.

257
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,940
You wanna hurt me.

258
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,020
Hey, open. Like this.

259
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,980
You just look at me
and everything
is gonna be okay.

260
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,100
Look at me now.

261
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Patrick.

262
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,260
There you are.
It's okay. It's okay, really.

263
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,580
Dr. Wilson. Wilson!

264
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,500
I just spoke to Cuddy.

265
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,900
She can't confirm
whether House

266
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,220
is applying for
a job in Boston.

267
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,940
Yeah. I'm late for a...

268
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,220
If I have to look for work,
I have a right to know.

269
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,700
(PLAYING PIANO)

270
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,180
Pretty.

271
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,780
I wrote this when I was
in junior high school.

272
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,060
Could never figure
out what came next.

273
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,060
Then dimwit
came up with this.

274
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,860
(PLAYING PIANO)

275
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,500
It's good.

276
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,340
It's perfect.

277
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,020
I could set up
a tower on the roof
during a lightning storm.

278
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,700
Help you switch
brains with your patient.

279
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,460
Then you would be
the brilliant pianist

280
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,860
and he would be the doctor
hiding brain cancer
from his friend.

281
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,900
It's nothing.

282
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,180
You need to talk about it.

283
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,340
You need to talk about it.

284
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,980
At least let me look
at your medical file.

285
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,300
You're making a big
deal out of nothing.

286
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,500
Who else knows?

287
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,140
No one,
and cancer isn't nothing.

288
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,260
Sorry. Didn't mean to
offend your specialty.

289
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,620
Why didn't you come to me?

290
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,820
Stein's good.

291
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,980
Stein's in Africa for
the next six months.

292
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,540
He's given me
at least six months.

293
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,260
I go to Boston.
I get the treatment.

294
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,820
Everything will be fine.

295
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,580
No need to talk about it.

296
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,300
CHASE: You were right.

297
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,980
Surgeon found
a bleed behind the kidney

298
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,420
in the retroperitoneal cavity,
but no reason for it.

299
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,860
No cancer,
no ruptured arteries.

300
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,020
So bleeding explains
the symptoms

301
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,620
but we've got no explanation
for the bleeding.

302
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,180
And while they
were closing him up,

303
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,420
Patrick had
a grand mal seizure,

304
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,860
which makes no sense,

305
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,340
since he's on
an anticonvulsant medication.

306
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,300
You told him.

307
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,700
No, I didn't.

308
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,660
I only told Cameron.

309
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,780
HOUSE: Hey!

310
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,540
Okay, you guys
have cleverly deduced
that I have cancer.

311
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,860
You have no right to know.

312
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,020
You have no business knowing.

313
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,420
We'd like to run
some blood tests.

314
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,860
As soon as you
work up our patient,
who is not me.

315
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,820
We just want to make sure
you weren't misdiagnosed.

316
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,500
I wasn't. Let's move on.

317
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,300
We're just asking
for a couple of vials.

318
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,860
No!
Why not?

319
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,020
Okay, we are going to proceed
as if I am perfectly healthy.

320
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,900
How can we do that
if we know you're not?

321
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,940
You don't know anything!

322
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,460
Except, hopefully,

323
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,020
how a patient on
anticonvulsant medication
has a seizure.

324
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,580
Anti-seizure meds
don't prevent seizures.

325
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,980
They just make
them manageable.

326
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,260
According to
the surgeon's report,

327
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,820
this one wasn't even
close to manageable.

328
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,140
Means the question isn't,
"Why is he having seizures?"

329
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,620
It's, "Why are his
seizures getting worse?"

330
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,980
What's changed?

331
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,020
His brain. It's gotten worse.

332
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,180
So we make it even worser.

333
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,420
We take him off
anticonvulsant medication.

334
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,580
CAMERON:
He'll seize even more.

335
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
Multiple seizures can
seriously damage a brain.

336
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,220
Dude can't button a shirt.

337
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,980
How much more damage
are we really talking about?

338
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,060
Stronger seizures
will light up
different parts of the brain,

339
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,860
which will indicate
which parts are damaged.

340
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,340
Once he gets worse,
do a PET scan.

341
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,460
(DOOR SHUTS)

342
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,100
PET scan done?

343
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,620
No.

344
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
Did you come for my feelings?

345
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,740
'Cause I left them
in my other pants.

346
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,380
This is a letter
of recommendation.

347
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,380
I'm applying
for a job at Penn.

348
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,660
Thank you for
writing your own.

349
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,620
I'm sure my thoughts
are beautifully phrased.

350
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,580
Thank you for signing it,
saves me having to
fake your signature.

351
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,620
Stay away from Weiss.

352
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,420
He cries with his patients,
holds their hands as they die.

353
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,060
He won't like you.

354
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,020
Your newfound nonchalance
in the face of cancer.

355
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,340
I thought you'd
find it appealing.

356
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,780
20 seconds. Pretty good.

357
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,100
For what?

358
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,540
The time it took you to go
from hard-ass to human being.

359
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,820
You really want to leave?

360
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,620
If you're not here,
there's not much
point in staying.

361
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,540
I'm not dead yet.

362
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,180
What are you doing?

363
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,340
I know this must be
a turn-on for you.

364
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,540
A little whorish
to kiss and stab.

365
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,020
You kissed back.

366
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,580
I didn't want you to die
without knowing the feeling.

367
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,020
Actually, no woman should die
without knowing the feeling.

368
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,140
All we need is a few
drops of your blood.

369
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,300
Foreman and Chase's lips
are not gonna get so close,

370
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,780
now that I know your plan.

371
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,820
There's a nurse downstairs
about to risk his job

372
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,380
to steal the blood
you drew from
yourself yesterday.

373
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,820
I'm patient number 020406,

374
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,580
in the record room,
under the name Luke N. Laura.

375
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,060
There's a whole vial of blood
in there along with CT scans,

376
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,740
MRls, CSF.
Everything you need.

377
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,740
If you need a sperm sample,
come back without the needle.

378
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,060
Six centimeter mass
in his dorsal midbrain,

379
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,420
extending into
the temporal lobe.

380
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,860
That's inoperable.

381
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,860
What kind of
time does he have?

382
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,860
He's got a year.

Nurse! Nurse!

385
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,340
Here's the consent from Boston
for the cancer drug trial.

386
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,620
Any description
of the process
or previous trials?

387
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,540
Yep.
Any chance it'll work?

388
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,380
No. It's not even
designed to work.

389
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,820
Why would he...

390
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,820
It's designed to
treat depression
in terminal cancer patients.

391
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,060
He doesn't seem depressed.

(DOOR BANGING)

393
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,940
Okay,
let's assume that I am dying,

394
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,700
which I specifically
told you not to assume.

395
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,740
Can we at least assume
that I'm not dying tomorrow?

396
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,860
Whereas this kid...

397
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,300
PET revealed
several more hot spots
but they're non-specific.

398
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,180
How can you focus on him?

399
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,140
It's the only way I can cope.

400
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,940
PET also showed a left brain
that's working hard.

401
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,100
Harder than the right?

402
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,700
Wouldn't be worth
mentioning otherwise.

403
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,940
Bleeding in the brain,
blood would
irritate the lining,

404
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,940
might cause
the seizures to get worse.

405
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,340
Yes, he needs an angiogram
to look at the vasculature
inside his brain.

406
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,740
We'll get right on it
as soon as
we're finished here.

407
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,340
Don't get up. I got it.
You're busy. Continue.

408
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,620
You know what my team
is doing right now?

409
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,140
No.

410
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,300
They're trying to figure out
what's wrong with me.

411
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,420
What's wrong with you?

412
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,780
Thanks for asking.

413
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,260
They've found out
that I'm dying.

414
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,860
That's sad.

415
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,380
Everyone's dying.

416
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,660
That's sad.

417
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,220
If a meteor lands
on my head tomorrow,
it's all academic.

418
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,140
I told them to leave me alone.
But did they?

419
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,380
Did they?

420
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,980
That one was rhetorical.

421
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,260
Oh.

422
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,460
No, they did not.

423
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,580
Who the hell were you
before you hit your head?

424
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,220
Hell is a bad word.

425
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,740
So is "ass" and "bitch."

426
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,860
I could probably
rattle off 50 much more

427
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,660
complicated and
disgusting ones,

428
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,060
but then your dad
would get pissed at me.

429
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,420
You like your life?

430
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,300
What life?

431
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,540
Your life.

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,140
Playing the piano,
going on tour,
scoring girls left and right.

433
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,860
I don't like girls.

434
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,060
Boys. Whatever gets you off.

435
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,700
I like the piano.

436
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,820
What's wrong?

437
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,020
Dr. Peter Hayes.
This is Eric Foreman,
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

438
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,740
You're doing
a signal transduction
inhibitor clinical trial.

439
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,460
What kind of
results have you been...

440
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,340
Transduction inhibitors
are a decade away.

441
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,260
Bye, Pete.

442
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,020
They've got another
trial going at Duke.

443
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,100
15 percent extend their lives
beyond five years.

444
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,380
If you're positive
for protein PHF...

445
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,940
Stop trying to save me.

446
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,940
I'm fine.

447
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,580
MRA confirmed small
collections of blood

448
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,940
throughout the white matter
of Patrick's
right hemisphere.

449
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,540
Mind if we chat about that
for a few moments?

450
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,180
Either trauma, an aneurysm,
cancer or autoimmune disease.

451
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,860
We need a biopsy to
figure out which it is.

452
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,460
His EEG was non-specific.

453
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,460
Where you going to biopsy?

454
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,420
Everywhere.

455
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,540
Sure, just put on a blindfold
and play "Pin
the Tail on the Brain."

456
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,220
He's bleeding into his brain.
He's dying.

457
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,780
You can't just randomly
stab the temporal lobe

458
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,180
and hope you hit
the right spot.

459
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,700
I'm only gonna take
little tiny pieces.

460
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,820
Till what?

461
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,940
Till I find the problem.

462
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,980
Or you kill him.

463
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,460
No, I'll keep going,
even if I kill him.

464
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,100
Then he's screwed.
Thanks for the chat.

465
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,700
What if we do the EEG
from inside his brain?

466
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,300
I'm actually
a little insulted.

467
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,700
You were supposed to
spend the last hour
worrying about me.

468
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,980
It's risky and invasive.

469
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,940
But that's why God invented
the long consent form.

470
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,740
Can you get to why
this is a brilliant idea?

471
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,780
External EEG
could get confused

472
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,900
if there are multiple
structural abnormalities.

473
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,580
If we perform
the EEG inside the skull,

474
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,100
it could show us
where to biopsy.

475
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,220
Brilliant. Go. Do.

476
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,300
I'd also like to
talk to you about...

477
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,620
This is going to be personal,
isn't it?

478
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,900
Yeah.

479
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,100
FOREMAN: We'll use
a small drill to
get inside his skull.

480
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,260
OBYEDKOV:
There's bleeding inside?

481
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,260
Yes. Once we have 12 holes,

482
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,180
we'll surgically
implant the electrodes

483
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,420
under the meninges,
against the brain.

484
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,540
OBYEDKOV: And it's
either cancer or
autoimmune disease?

485
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,620
FOREMAN: Sorry, but yeah.

486
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,220
OBYEDKOV: Which one is better?

487
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,380
Neither.

488
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,220
Hey.

489
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,340
Where do we cut?

490
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,460
We don't.

491
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,460
I need to say something.

492
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,460
Something personal?

493
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
Yeah.

494
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,100
And I can't leave

495
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,260
because you've got
something interesting
in that file.

496
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,500
Sorry.

497
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,220
You're an arrogant ass who
makes it impossible
for anyone to like him

498
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,980
by punishing people
who don't deserve...

499
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,820
Can you get to the "but" part
of this speech?

500
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,820
But I like you.

501
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,100
No, you don't.

502
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,820
You're just reacting to
the perception of my death

503
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,980
and the need to
put things in order.
Fear of guilt...

504
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,180
Just shut up.

505
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,260
See? I annoy you.

506
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,660
Now,
you gonna give me the results
or are you gonna...

507
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,060
(SIGHS)

508
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,820
Intracranial EEG showed
no electrical abnormalities.

509
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,540
Which means it's autoimmune.
No.

510
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,780
It also showed
his entire right
hemisphere is brain-dead.

511
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:11,060
So while you guys
were worrying about me,
half this kid's brain died.

512
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,660
The only solace you
should take from this
is the fact that it didn't.

513
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,660
Garden variety EEG sucks
compared to
the in-brain variety,

514
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,100
but it's not going
to miss brain death.

515
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,980
He's gotten worse.
Not that much worse.

516
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,380
Respiration is depressed.

517
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,260
Seizures are increasing,
one every five minutes.

518
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,380
Not that much worse.

519
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,300
He can still talk
and he's left-handed,

520
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,900
which means speech
is in the right side.

521
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,180
You don't know how
Patrick's brain reorganized
itself 25 years ago.

522
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,380
What if the right side
is just a little dead?

523
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,660
Maybe he still has
random neurons firing.

524
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,700
You're just looking for
a puzzle to distract you
from your own situation.

525
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,420
You're right, he's dead.
Let's go home.

526
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,500
What did you find out?

527
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
Is he gonna be okay?

528
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,620
I'm sorry.
Yes!

529
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,380
What's this?

530
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,780
A piano.

531
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,820
What's this?

532
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,740
He's obviously lost use...

533
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,900
Shut up.

534
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,500
Music is a global process.

535
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,980
You can't play
the piano with half a brain.

536
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,740
What's it mean?

537
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,300
Means the right side of
his brain has always sucked.

538
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,620
Means it's not relevant
to what's going on now.

539
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,660
Wow. Then it's autoimmune.
Yeah.

540
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,380
Question is what
do we do about it?

541
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,700
Most likely ones we can fix.

542
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,060
Polyarteritis nodosa,
Takayasu or Sarcoid.

543
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,780
I'll start treatment.

544
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,220
Not what I was talking about.

545
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,820
But, yeah, you do that.

546
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,420
Your turn?

547
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,380
Do you have to do that?

548
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,100
You mean cheapen
everyone's attempt
at a human moment

549
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,100
by identifying
the real calculations
that go into it?

550
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

551
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,180
I'm sorry you're dying,
I'm gonna hug you.

552
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,820
Anything to say?

553
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,060
If you're considering
grabbing my ass,

554
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,660
don't start anything
you can't finish.

555
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,940
Well, as long as
we're just standing here,
you mind if we work?

556
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,900
How's the kid's
treatment going?

557
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,020
Are you crying?

558
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,220
No.

559
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,220
Respiration rate's up.

560
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,620
Seizures are calming down.
It's all good.

561
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,940
Not for what
I'm gonna do next.

562
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,460
There is no next.
He's gonna be fine.

563
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,220
Only if he wants to
remain a four-year-old
who wets his bed.

564
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,300
There's nothing else for him.

565
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,420
There's better.
Thanks for the hug.

00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,140
(DOORBELL CONTINUES BUZZING)

568
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,780
It's the middle of the night.

569
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,540
You knew I'd be asleep.

570
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,780
Phone would have woken you up
just as much.

571
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,540
And I can't see
what you're wearing
on the phone.

572
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,100
My patient with the 55 IQ
has Takayasu syndrome.

573
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,220
Very uncommon.

574
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,180
Happens mostly
in Asian women.

575
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,860
Takayasu is
manageable with steroids,
which you already know.

576
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,660
So I assume you're here
for something else.

577
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,860
My patient also has
a significant
seizure problem.

578
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,380
Also manageable with
anticonvulsant medication.

579
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,940
Yes, and if he
kept taking his
anticonvulsant medication,

580
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,540
he could go back on tour
and play the piano.

581
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,580
But a hemispherectomy

582
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,660
would completely stop
the right-brain seizure
activity

583
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,220
and he would no
longer need to take

584
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,700
his anticonvulsant medication.

585
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,340
You want to remove
half his brain?

586
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,580
The right half.

587
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,140
It would be irresponsible
to remove the left.

588
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,620
You don't remove half a brain
and gain function!

589
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,060
Not my brain.
But his? Who knows? What?

590
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,620
Let's say that
I'm the left side
of Patrick's brain.

591
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,740
I'm quick-witted,
I'm charming,
I'm great looking.

592
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,460
You're the right
side of his brain.

593
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,180
You're useless, old, damaged.

594
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,620
We go to a bar for a drink.

595
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,060
Now, I have the mad skills
to be scoring
all the hot babes,

596
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,780
but instead I'm
spending my time
wiping drool off your chin

597
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,780
and making sure
you don't eat the tablecloth.

598
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,060
What's the father want to do?

599
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,700
I don't know.

600
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,020
So go wake him up.

601
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,780
House, I'm so sorry.

602
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,900
Forgot I was dying, huh?

603
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,620
I'm here if you need me.

604
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,420
I need you.

605
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,980
One small feel for man,
one giant ass for mankind.

606
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,700
Thanks.

607
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,740
Good luck in Boston.

00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,540
Call
the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

609
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,980
Dr. Foreman was just here.

610
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,060
The seizures have
almost completely gone away.

611
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,300
Says we might be
able to go home
in the next day or two.

612
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,860
Thank you so much.

613
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,540
I think we should remove
the right side of
your son's brain.

614
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,900
I thought you fixed him.

615
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,020
Does he look fixed?

616
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,300
The right side of his brain is
keeping him walking straight.

617
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,260
Other than that,
it's been dead weight
ever since the accident.

618
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,500
If we remove it,
the seizures
would stop completely.

619
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,180
The seizures are
hardly noticeable.

620
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,860
They don't bother Patrick.

621
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,540
But without the seizures,

622
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,740
the left side
would have a chance
to actually function.

623
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,980
It could learn
to do new things.

624
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,580
Only bummer,
he'd never play
the piano again.

625
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,300
Oh, no.
The piano is everything.

626
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,940
I'm not saying
he's never
gonna work for NASA,

627
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,380
but flipping burgers
isn't out of the question.

628
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,900
Well, I don't mind
taking care of him
so he can play the piano.

629
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,220
No, you're actually lucky.

630
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,740
You don't have to
watch your kid grow up.

631
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,220
You don't have to let go.

632
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,260
You trying to
make this about me?

633
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,500
I love my son,
just the way he is!

634
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,620
He's a monkey
grinder at the circus.

635
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,260
He's worked hard
to get where he...

636
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,820
So does the monkey.

637
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,500
The piano is
a neurological accident.

638
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,740
He has a gift.

639
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,420
I'm offering him a life.

640
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,380
It's up to you.

641
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,660
I've isolated
the cancer proteins
in House's CSF.

642
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,660
About time.
We can't let him go to Boston

643
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,620
if he qualifies
for the Duke trial.

644
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,300
You want to do it?

645
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,740
Damn. He's negative
for protein PHF.

646
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,700
He doesn't qualify.

647
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,460
What's that?
That shouldn't be there.

648
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,340
Patrick?

649
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,220
Hello, Papa.

650
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,740
Patrick,
I have a question for you.

651
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,500
Yes?

652
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,700
Are you happy?

653
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,540
Are you happy?

00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,580
There was
an abnormal presence of lgG
and lgM, indicating...

660
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,580
I don't have neurosyphilis.
My MRI showed nothing...

661
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,660
It's a gumma in your brain.
It's very rare not
to be in the liver,

662
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,700
and I'm really glad
we never slept together but...

663
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,180
We would have used a condom.

664
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,260
And I don't have syphilis.
My VDRL was negative...

665
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,820
We did an FTA
antibody test.

666
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,060
The VDRL was
a false negative.

667
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,100
You're not going to die.

IV antibiotics.

00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,020
Did you send these
results to Mass General?

670
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,580
Of course.

671
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,540

you celebrating?

Because it
wasn't my damn file.

that he's not gonna die

but he is cheating on her.

Why would you want us
to think that you...

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,940
I didn't!

684
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,340
I wanted the guys in Boston
to think that I had cancer.

685
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,900
I wanted the guys who were
gonna implant a cool drug

686
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,500
right into the pleasure center
of my brain to think
that I had cancer!

687
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,340
You faked cancer to get high?

688
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,020
I'm going to bed.

689
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,500
You're right.
I don't like you.

690
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,940
Sure. Now that I'm not dying.

691

hemispherectomy went well.

He's unconscious but...

694
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,780
How depressed are you?

695
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,260
I'm not depressed.

696
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,660
You faked cancer.

697
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,020
It was
an outpatient procedure.

698
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,300
I was curious.

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,140
Are you curious about heroin?

700
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,380
Not since last year's
Christmas party.

701
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,220
I know this goes
against your nature,

702
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,540
but can we not
make too much of this?

703
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,380
You made people think
that you were going to die!

704
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,500
I didn't make them.

705
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,900
I tried to hide it,

706
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,460
but you idiots needed to
get into my business.

707
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,820
I'm sure I'll regret asking,
but why are you laughing?

708
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,340
It's ironic.

709
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,460
Well, I'm sure I'll
regret asking, but why...

710
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,700
Depression in
cancer patients...

711
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,340
It's not as
common as you think.

712
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,900
It's not the dying
that gets to people.

713
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,540
It's the dying alone.
The patients with family,
with friends,

714
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,380
they tend to do okay.

715
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,460
You don't have cancer.

716
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,420
You do have
people who give a damn.

717
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,900
So what do you do?

718
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,460
You fake the cancer,
then push
the people who care away.

719
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,780
Because they're boring.

720
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,780
Go home to your hotel room
and laugh at that irony.

721
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,900
Start small, House.
Take a chance.

722
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,540
Maybe something
that doesn't involve
sticking stuff in your brain.

723
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,340
Pizza with a friend.

724
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,100
A movie. Something.

725
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,220
Follow my finger.
Do you know your name?

726
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,420
His speech center
was on the right side.

727
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,820
It'll be a while
before he's talking.

728
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,260
He hasn't
really done anything

729
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,540
except to stare off
into the distance.

730
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,260
It'll take some time to...

731
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,620
You buttoned your shirt.

732
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,220
He looks happy.

733
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,020
