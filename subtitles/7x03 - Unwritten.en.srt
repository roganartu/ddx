1
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:39,665
<i> They have a cure
for that, you know?</i>

2
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,383
<i>It's called a computer.</i>

3
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:42,618
We done for the day,

4
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:44,170
or do I need to find
something else to read?

5
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:46,889
I'm done.

6
00:00:46,956 --> 00:00:49,725
It's done.

7
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,194
No way. It's finished?

8
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:53,946
Well, how--how's it end?

9
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:55,231
I mean, you got to let me read it.

10
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:57,483
Not this time.

11
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,652
W--you at least got to
tell me what happens.

12
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:01,237
<i>Come on.</i>

13
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:03,355
How am I supposed to help with
the next book if you don't--

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,675
there isn't going
to be a next book.

15
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:11,146
You can't be serious. Why?

16
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:12,414
You wouldn't understand.

17
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:13,833
Try me.

18
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:23,008
I just can't do it anymore.

19
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:25,878
I'm not brave like you.

20
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:30,015
But writing' your whole life.

21
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,101
<i>What are you gonna do without it?</i>

22
00:01:32,168 --> 00:01:35,604
What I should have done years ago.

23
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:37,005
What are you doing?

24
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:38,390
<i>Put it down, or I'll--</i>

25
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:41,043
I'll make you.

26
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:44,363
How, Jack?

27
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:46,782
You don't even exist.

28
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,987
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:00,964 --> 00:02:02,164
Miss Tanner.

30
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:04,233
Miss Tanner.

31
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:06,752
Oh, dear God.

32
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:21,527
Which of these says "I want
to sleep with you" more?

33
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:23,729
Penguin or beaver?

34
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:25,864
Beaver. Beaver. Beaver.

35
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:27,783
You're right. It's too high school.

36
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,184
<i>What did you do to piss Cuddy off?</i>

37
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:31,320
I can't be romantic?

38
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:33,372
House, you're stealing
from a woman in a coma.

39
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:35,991
We're fine. Never seen her happier.

40
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,711
Yeah? How about you?

41
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:40,829
I'm...Worried.

42
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,214
Because she's happy?

43
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,799
No, because I am.

44
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:44,833
House, that's--

45
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:47,336
ironic? Weird? Crazy?

46
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:49,388
I was going to say normal.

47
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:51,090
For now.

48
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:52,341
We're in the honeymoon period.

49
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:55,344
Our brains are flooded
with endorphins.

50
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:56,729
Once she snaps out of it,

51
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:57,763
where does that leave us?

52
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:59,565
In an adult relationship.

53
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:03,485
Name one thing that Cuddy and
I have in common besides work.

54
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:05,887
There's...

55
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,106
You're both...

56
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,073
Wait.

57
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:09,742
Exactly.

58
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,778
Long-term relationships are
based on compatibility,

59
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:14,730
and right now we only have sex.

60
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,398
House, you don't actually think

61
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:18,167
she'd dump you because you, what,

62
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:19,735
don't do yoga?

63
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:20,836
Listen to the B-52s?

64
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,671
Not right away.

65
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:26,175
We'll fight, makeup sex,

66
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:28,010
fight, maybe sex,

67
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:29,745
and then she'll dump me.

68
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:32,214
With possible goodbye sex.

69
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:34,433
So, instead of enjoying
the honeymoon phase,

70
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,752
you've decided to skip it entirely.

71
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:39,138
I need to find something
that we both like doing

72
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:40,689
besides each other.

73
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:42,941
Right. Or you could just
talk to her about it.

74
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,144
No, then she'll start
pretending to like things

75
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:47,229
that she really doesn't
just to make me feel better,

76
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,647
which will make her
feel even worse,

77
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:51,433
which won't be my fault,
so I'll resent her,

78
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:53,619
and that won't be her fault,
so she'll resent me.

79
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:55,871
At least with my plan

80
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:58,991
I get my one a day with
iron till the bitter end.

81
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:00,626
Is there a reason why
you're following me?

82
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,378
Oh, yeah.

83
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:06,298
You're not gonna believe who
just checked into the E.R.

84
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:08,217
The doctor hasn't examined you yet.

85
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:09,385
There's nothing wrong with me.

86
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:11,303
My maid just overreacted.

87
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:13,389
<i>Great.</i>

88
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,340
This won't take long then.

89
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:17,226
EMTs found her unconscious.

90
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:19,645
Her maid said she had a seizure.

91
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,730
I fainted.

92
00:05:21,798 --> 00:05:23,982
Huge Jack Cannon fan, by the way.

93
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:24,966
Love your books.

94
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:26,568
Really?

95
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:30,138
My fans tend to be
overly-annoying teenaged girls.

96
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,390
I know.

97
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,325
All they care about
is who's hotter,

98
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,493
Jack or Deacon.

99
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,211
Like Sarah can't love both of them.

100
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,980
I may belong to one or
two online fan clubs.

101
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,502
How's the new book coming along?

102
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:45,504
I don't talk about my work.

103
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:47,172
'Kay.

104
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:48,323
How about nodding your head

105
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:51,810
to a few yes/no questions?

106
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:53,612
But I'll make you a deal.

107
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,931
You finish this exam quickly,

108
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:58,634
and I'll answer one question.

109
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,935
About anything?

110
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:01,136
Anything.

111
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:02,721
Who was Jack's real father,

112
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,640
who kidnapped his Uncle...

113
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:07,893
Deal.

114
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:09,394
I will have to go with

115
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:11,647
why'd you try to kill yourself?

116
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:12,998
Burn on the side of your face

117
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:14,616
is caused by gunpowder,

118
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,101
so change your mind
at the last second,

119
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,036
or you just a lousy shot?

120
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:19,187
I'm out of here.

121
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:21,022
Can't. We had a deal.

122
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:23,208
Try and stop me.

123
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:24,409
Okay.

124
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:27,362
This woman is on a
72-hour psychiatric hold.

125
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,698
If she tries to run, shoot her.

126
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:30,666
With a sedative.

127
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:32,417
That's more convenient.

128
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,680
You called us back to work

129
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:47,048
because a lady might
have had a seizure.

130
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,651
A seizure while trying
to commit suicide.

131
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:50,903
So send her for a psych eval.

132
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:52,821
What's that got to do with us?

133
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,556
What is the matter with you people?

134
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:58,861
We're talking about a human
being who's suffering.

135
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:00,996
You're right. That's not enough.

136
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:05,284
She is also the writer of
Jack Cannon: Boy Detective,

137
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:07,252
beloved by millions
around the world.

138
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:11,340
<i>By girls between 10 and 14.</i>

139
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:13,041
Look, the point is

140
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:14,710
if she kills herself,

141
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,912
millions of fans of
all ages and genders

142
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:18,931
will be very disappointed.

143
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:20,632
So we're taking this
case 'cause you're a fan?

144
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:22,467
No, that would be crazy
and unprofessional.

145
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,269
You're taking this
case 'cause I said so.

146
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:25,504
You and Taub do a full workup.

147
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:27,139
Observe her overnight.

148
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:29,274
See if she has another seizure.
You can go.

149
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,659
Why does he get the night off?

150
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,228
Because he brought
a smokin' hot babe.

151
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:40,953
I have plans with my wife.

152
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:42,037
Yeah, nice try,

153
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:43,488
but you hate your personal life.

154
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:46,909
And you obviously don't have one.

155
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,044
Hey.

156
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,730
<i>I'd stay myself,</i>

157
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:54,082
but I just bought the flowers.

158
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,053
Reservation for Dominica's
isn't till 8:00,

159
00:07:58,121 --> 00:07:59,471
so we got plenty of time.

160
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:01,957
We need to pick something
up from a haunted house?

161
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:04,509
This is a Gothic
Revival masterpiece.

162
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:07,596
I hope one day to live
in a house like this.

163
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,321
Your friend's a writer?

164
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,223
One of the best.

165
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:22,995
She wants me to read
her latest manuscript.

166
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:25,113
Alice Tanner.

167
00:08:25,164 --> 00:08:26,815
Why does that name sound familiar?

168
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:29,484
I gave you a couple of her
books a few years ago.

169
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:34,806
No.

170
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:38,010
She's the woman you
put on the psych hold.

171
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,027
This isn't a date.

172
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:40,662
We're on a case.

173
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:42,431
Ever hear of multitasking?

174
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,349
Did you steal her keys?

175
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:47,269
Think I'd take the Dean of
Medicine on a "B" and "E"?

176
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:51,290
How did you get in here?

177
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:53,725
Well, I guess you have your answer.

178
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:56,962
When was your last physical?

179
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:58,446
A while ago.

180
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:02,217
I don't like doctors.

181
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:04,219
Any history of
seizures before today?

182
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:05,937
Not that I recall.

183
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,889
Are we almost done?

184
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,474
I'm tired.

185
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,709
<i>The exam would go faster</i>

186
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:12,460
if you would cooperate with us.

187
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:14,096
I am.

188
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:16,297
You're evading every
question we ask.

189
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,899
Why do you say that?

190
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:19,768
That.

191
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:22,220
I didn't ask for help.

192
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:24,823
Committing a suicidal
gesture says otherwise.

193
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:26,842
It wasn't a gesture.

194
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,060
I had the damn seizure

195
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:30,529
before I could get
the gun in my mouth.

196
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,814
You want to tell us why?

197
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:33,949
You want to know my life story,

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,451
my secret, inner pain?

199
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:38,120
Maybe if I just open up a little,

200
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:41,039
you'll be able to save me?

201
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,258
We're just trying to help you.

202
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:47,328
Thank you.

203
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,496
I want a woman doctor.

204
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:50,098
And back to being evasive.

205
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,901
It's my right as a patient.

206
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,520
So please get out. Now.

207
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:56,605
We need to observe you overnight.

208
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:58,390
You really think I'm stupid enough

209
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,525
to try and kill
myself in a hospital?

210
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:02,110
To see if you have another seizure.

211
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:03,612
We'll be up there,

212
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,513
and we won't disturb you
unless there's a problem.

213
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:06,965
That work for you?

214
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:09,551
Whatever it takes to
get you out of here.

215
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:15,207
House, Christina has agreed
to not call the police.

216
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,992
She's probably illegal.

217
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:19,360
Same reason she didn't
report the suicide attempt.

218
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,163
I call 911.

219
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:22,881
But when Miss Tanner woke up,

220
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,032
she say she will fire me

221
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,450
if I say anything about the gun.

222
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:27,753
And if she whacks herself,
what happens to your job?

223
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:33,008
I think she's a very
depressed person.

224
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:34,142
<i>Never goes out,</i>

225
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,977
doesn't have friends.

226
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:38,263
<i>She has all this money,</i>

227
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,681
but all she does is write.

228
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:43,452
I need to see her
latest manuscript.

229
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,271
She always locks up
her writing in there.

230
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,523
<i>Has she ever complained</i>

231
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:51,610
about physical pain or stress?

232
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:52,711
<i>Yes.</i>

233
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:55,914
Her back and her hands hurt a lot.

234
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:57,632
A writer with back and hand pain.

235
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,501
That's very helpful. Let's go.

236
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,937
Sometimes I hear her cry at night.

237
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:05,290
When she thinks nobody's listening.

238
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,575
I should have done something.

239
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:09,161
True.

240
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:12,380
What are you doing?

241
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:14,433
Before there were hard drives,

242
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,885
there were...

243
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,646
How many of these
does she eat a day?

244
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,647
Two for lunch.

245
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,032
Sometimes three.

246
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,491
Still no seizure activity.

247
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,942
It's your turn--

248
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,213
What the hell?

249
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:49,450
Close. House.

250
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,919
She's fine.

251
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,054
Both the E.E.G.
and all her vitals have been--

252
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,313
<i>you.</i>

253
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:02,814
What do you want?

254
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:06,434
You wet the bed.

255
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:08,603
Just not sure how yet.

256
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:19,478
Good morning, gentlemen.

257
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:21,096
Well, if it's any consolation,

258
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:23,765
I didn't get any sleep either.

259
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:25,784
Unilateral hyperhidrosis.

260
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:27,135
Interesting.

261
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:28,704
She also admitted she
tried to kill herself,

262
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:29,688
but won't tell us why.

263
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:31,306
House seared her home,

264
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:33,125
found she's been eating two
cans of tuna a day for years.

265
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:34,660
Mercury poisoning?

266
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:35,744
<i> Explains the seizures,</i>

267
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:37,112
<i>hand and back pain,</i>

268
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:38,530
also the depression.

269
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:40,465
Explains everything except
the fact that it's not.

270
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:41,783
We got her urine and
blood samples back.

271
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,018
They're normal.

272
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:44,336
<i> If it's low level,</i>

273
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,671
<i>it might not show up in a spot check.</i>

274
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:47,039
<i>We need to run continuous testing
to find it.</i>

275
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,540
We can't. She wants
a female doctor.

276
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,509
She only asked for a
woman to waste time.

277
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:54,096
She's cooperating just enough
to get through the psych hold.

278
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:57,382
Put some lipstick on Chase
and start chelation therapy.

279
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,251
Confirm with another urine test.

280
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:02,554
Okay.

281
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,389
I'll go talk to Cuddy.

282
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:06,458
Maybe she'll let us
borrow a dress too.

283
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:20,222
Ahe--ahem.

284
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:22,841
This would be me ignoring you.

285
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:24,810
What if we got arrested last night?

286
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:26,595
And whatever happened to keeping

287
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:28,613
our professional and
personal lives separate?

288
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:31,683
I'm not the one talking about
our relationship at work.

289
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:33,735
What's behind your back?

290
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:36,905
Peace penguin.

291
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:38,473
What room should I return it to?

292
00:13:38,524 --> 00:13:39,775
243.

293
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:41,109
<i>I need some help with Alice Tanner.</i>

294
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,911
She wants a vagina.

295
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:45,464
I'm pretty attached to mine.

296
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:48,300
I told you to hire a temporary
replacement for Thirteen

297
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:49,384
<i>two weeks ago.</i>

298
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:50,736
I've been busy. Doing what?

299
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:52,537
You.

300
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:53,922
So you'll talk her out of it?

301
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:56,425
You'll hire a woman doctor?

302
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:57,642
You think we just sit around

303
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,644
talking sports and
belching and farting

304
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,013
when the chicks aren't around?

305
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:02,064
By when?

306
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:03,081
Next week.

307
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,133
Next week it is.

308
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:08,253
What makes you think it's Mercury?

309
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:09,521
Your symptoms.

310
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:11,656
Now I can perform the
procedure yourself

311
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,059
<i>if you still prefer a woman doctor,</i>

312
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:16,144
but the team you have is our best.

313
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:18,780
That's an interesting
perfume you're wearing.

314
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,315
It was a gift.

315
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:23,318
From Dr. House?

316
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:25,337
It was all over him last night.

317
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,122
If you'd prefer
another female doctor,

318
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:28,840
I can arrange that as well.

319
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:31,626
I also smelled it somewhere
else more recently.

320
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:34,796
Faint, but unmistakable.

321
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,548
You should have worn

322
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:39,584
a different cardigan
this morning, Christina.

323
00:14:39,652 --> 00:14:42,771
Something you'd like
to tell me, dear?

324
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:45,974
When I found you yesterday,

325
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:48,610
I thought I was too late.

326
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:52,397
I talked to them so I
could help you get better.

327
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,716
I just don't want to
see you suffer anymore.

328
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:56,768
That won't be a problem.

329
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:58,904
You're fired.

330
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:00,455
<i>This woman cares about you.</i>

331
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:02,207
If it weren't for her--

332
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:03,942
I wouldn't be here now, would I?

333
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,627
I should have done it yesterday.

334
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,413
I understand that you're in pain,

335
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:11,049
but lashing out isn't the answer.

336
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:12,033
<i>Treatment is.</i>

337
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:13,668
I agree.

338
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,837
Send the men back.

339
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:19,357
At least they're not a bunch
of dewy-eyed cry-babies.

340
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:22,978
<i>What's that?</i>

341
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:27,799
It's the new Jack Cannon novel.

342
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,017
Suggestions?

343
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:30,018
Yeah.

344
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:31,019
Stop.

345
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,404
It can't be done.

346
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:35,941
People wonder why you've
never cured cancer.

347
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:39,211
Did you get this before or
after your date with Cuddy?

348
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,913
Eh, probably would have
been a wiser choice.

349
00:15:41,998 --> 00:15:43,782
Huh.

350
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:46,118
This is actually good, House.

351
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:47,953
<i>She's committing crimes.</i>

352
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:49,037
<i>What does that tell you?</i>

353
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:51,289
I'm a horrible influence.

354
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:52,507
True.

355
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,409
A horrible influence
she's reaching out to.

356
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,161
She's looking for ways to connect.

357
00:15:56,229 --> 00:16:00,415
<i>Sure, they're self-destructive,
juvenile, and insane,</i>

358
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:03,218
but so are you.

359
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,303
You do have something in common.

360
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:09,224
You're both trying to find
things you have in common.

361
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,894
And not finding them.

362
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:18,316
You don't look so hot.

363
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:21,002
Want to talk about it?

364
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,888
Those days are over.

365
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:36,001
Who were you talking to?

366
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:37,219
Myself.

367
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:38,336
If you're seeing things,

368
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:39,337
it could be another symptom.

369
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:40,972
It's not.

370
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,175
It's only in my imagination.

371
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,393
I make things up for a living.

372
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:49,397
And talking to them?

373
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:52,100
It's a writer thing.

374
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:54,152
We're also good at reading people.

375
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,471
Like you, for instance.

376
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:58,323
Recently divorced.

377
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:00,192
<i>You slept with a girl last night.</i>

378
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:02,043
<i>Her place, not yours.</i>

379
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:04,579
You probably won't
return her calls.

380
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:07,499
That...

381
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:12,621
How?

382
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:15,340
The tan line from your
former wedding ring.

383
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:17,542
<i>You stink of smoke,</i>

384
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:20,462
<i>but no yellow on your fingers
or teeth</i>

385
00:17:20,513 --> 00:17:22,314
<i>means she's the smoker.</i>

386
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:25,834
And you either didn't
shower or change.

387
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:29,938
Either way, her place.

388
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,339
Do him.

389
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,974
We're wasting time,

390
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,943
which is her main goal here.

391
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,344
<i>Need your arm for this.</i>

392
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:38,296
You remind me of my ex-husband.

393
00:17:38,364 --> 00:17:41,733
A cute man, but problems
in the bedroom department.

394
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:46,854
Not even close.

395
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:48,290
The ones I caught him in.

396
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:51,059
He cheated on me every
chance he could.

397
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:53,995
<i>The first time with my best friend.</i>

398
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:55,029
<i>The second...</i>

399
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:58,216
The bastard.

400
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,137
BP and heart rate are spiking.

401
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:04,589
Must be an allergic reaction
to the chelation agent.

402
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:06,374
I didn't give it to her yet.

403
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:09,459
<i> Pain, seizures, hyperhidros
is,</i>

404
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:11,375
<i>and sudden onset of radically
high blood pressure.</i>

405
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:14,228
Her continuous blood and
urine test came back.

406
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:16,447
It's definitely not
Mercury poisoning. Clean.

407
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:18,566
<i>Could be hemolytic uremic syndrome.</i>

408
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,618
<i> It's not. There weren't any
blood or protein markers</i>

409
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:21,969
<i>in her urine, either.</i>

410
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:23,404
<i>We also caught her talking to herself.</i>

411
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:24,855
<i>She could be delusional.</i>

412
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:26,457
<i>She's a writer and a recluse.</i>

413
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:27,858
<i>I'd be more surprised if she didn't
talk to herself.</i>

414
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,043
<i>You done playing with your ribbon?</i>

415
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:30,912
What was she doing
when it happened?

416
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:32,246
Sitting in bed.

417
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:34,582
She claims it was only
in her imagination,

418
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,550
<i>but still.</i>

419
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:37,168
When her BP spiked?

420
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:39,203
<i>Comparing Taub to her ex-husband.</i>

421
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:40,471
She really hated the guy.

422
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,673
<i>Her first symptom</i>

423
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:45,643
was when she had a gun to her head.

424
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,380
Excess adrenaline
could explain seizures

425
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,399
and skyrocketing BP.

426
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:53,150
A pheochromocytoma.

427
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:54,986
Get an MRI and find it.

428
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,664
Would you hold this?

429
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,922
I meant now.

430
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,763
Have I mentioned
I'm claustrophobic?

431
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:25,917
Have I mentioned we don't care?

432
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,435
What's wrong?

433
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,253
Nothing. Just a leg cramp.

434
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,976
Get her out of here.
She's got metal in her leg.

435
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:42,683
She has three screws
in her right leg

436
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:45,286
from a skiing accident
she didn't tell us about.

437
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,371
<i>The MRI's magnetic field sup
er heated the metal,</i>

438
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,739
<i>causing third-degree burns.</i>

439
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,995
Skin ruptured from internal
heat pressure here.

440
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,880
It's not our fault.

441
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:57,081
<i>She signed the consent forms,</i>

442
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:57,915
<i>denied there was any metal...</i>

443
00:19:57,966 --> 00:19:59,634
Normally I'd say it.

444
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:04,121
Maybe this way it'll
finally sink in.

445
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:06,140
She wants to die.

446
00:20:06,224 --> 00:20:08,476
You cannot trust anything she says.

447
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:09,877
Treating the soft tissue
injuries in her leg

448
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:11,112
cost us most of the day.

449
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,813
<i>We also had to replace the screws.</i>

450
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:14,965
<i>And finding a pheochromocytoma</i>

451
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:16,917
without using the mri
could take us a week.

452
00:20:16,985 --> 00:20:19,136
Longer, if she doesn't
stop lying to us.

453
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:21,072
Or we could figure
out a way to find it

454
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:24,575
in the 39 hours left
on her psych hold.

455
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:26,644
We need to make her cooperate.

456
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:28,813
We have to offer her
something she wants.

457
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,167
She wants to kill herself, House.

458
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:35,503
I can work with that.

459
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,381
I want you to write more books.

460
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:50,735
I'm done writing Jack
Cannon's adventures.

461
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:52,186
And when I get out of here,

462
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,022
I'll just be done.

463
00:20:55,107 --> 00:20:57,558
Now don't you say that,
you dirty birdie.

464
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,176
You know, there are
easier ways to go

465
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:00,511
than shooting yourself in the head

466
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:01,729
or tearing apart a limb.

467
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:04,882
And this is one of them.

468
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,652
The best part, you'll feel so good,

469
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:10,488
you won't even notice you're dead.

470
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,373
You expect me to believe

471
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:14,809
you're going to
help me kill myself?

472
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:15,876
You're the perceptive one.

473
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,795
You tell me.

474
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:19,030
Why?

475
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:20,581
We can't find your tumor in time

476
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,918
without your cooperation.

477
00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:25,486
So I'm giving you a choice.

478
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:27,455
<i>Give us a chance to make you better,</i>

479
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:31,142
or stick this anywhere and push.

480
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:33,728
Why do you care about me?

481
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:37,932
You think you know me
because you read my books?

482
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:39,567
No.

483
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:42,687
I know pain.

484
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:43,854
<i>Think you can handle it,</i>

485
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:46,691
<i>and one day you can't.</i>

486
00:21:46,742 --> 00:21:48,526
When that happens,

487
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:51,996
you either find reasons to go on,
or you don't.

488
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:54,198
I'm...

489
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,217
I'm all out of reasons.

490
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:57,251
<i>Now.</i>

491
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,170
When you're pain free,

492
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:02,173
you're gonna want to live
and start writing again.

493
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,959
<i>And if I'm wrong,</i>

494
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:08,846
got a backup plan to
take home with you.

495
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:11,599
Okay.

496
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,586
Good choice.

497
00:22:15,637 --> 00:22:16,804
If I were you,

498
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,856
I'd hide that if you
want to keep it.

499
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:20,408
I know the perfect place.

500
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,426
Morning, sunshine.

501
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:43,028
You're a real bastard.

502
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:45,864
You were supposed to choose life.

503
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:49,885
You're also an excellent liar.

504
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,855
Wasn't lying about the cure.

505
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:54,356
<i>If we find and remove that pesky,</i>

506
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:57,359
adrenaline-secreting tumor,

507
00:22:57,427 --> 00:22:58,694
you'll get better.

508
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:00,596
You better hurry.

509
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:03,682
My lawyer will have me out
of here this time tomorrow.

510
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,151
<i>Yeah, about that,</i>

511
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,419
it seems that last night

512
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:09,238
you found and self-administered

513
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,141
what you thought was a
potentially lethal narcotic.

514
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,592
<i>Your psych hold has be
en extended</i>

515
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,644
<i>an additional 24 hours.</i>

516
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,830
I know. Bummer, right?

517
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,004
You want to know
something about my book?

518
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:25,971
Sure.

519
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,224
Jack Cannon dies.

520
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:30,192
<i>I know.</i>

521
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,197
Bummer, right?

522
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:37,966
<i>We finished analyzing thePETt scans
from last night.</i>

523
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:39,234
<i>There's no sign of a tumor.</i>

524
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:41,053
<i>We sampled blood from s
ix different areas</i>

525
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:42,538
<i>looking for any spikes in adrenaline.</i>

526
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:43,806
All of them were negative.

527
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:45,074
If she told us her symptoms,

528
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:46,842
where it hurts,
when the pain first started,

529
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,194
<i>we could at least focus
on a specific area.</i>

530
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,645
<i>Or use them to rule areas out.</i>

531
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:51,914
She'll only lie.

532
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,582
We're better off not
even talking to her.

533
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,452
You think you can get her to
try to kill herself again?

534
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:58,470
We're gonna need more time.

535
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,539
There might be a way
to get her symptoms

536
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:01,823
without asking her.

537
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,176
If writers write what they know.

538
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,428
I thought you said it was
about a boy Detective.

539
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:09,048
And his mentor, Aunt Helen,

540
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:13,369
who happens to be around
the same age as Alice.

541
00:24:13,436 --> 00:24:15,504
Answers could be in the book.

542
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:19,992
Great. You finish reading
your typewriter ribbon yet?

543
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,027
Look for the tumor
with the ultrasound.

544
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:28,016
I drove across town
to treat a ribbon?

545
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:29,068
That's why I prefer lying.

546
00:24:29,152 --> 00:24:31,286
It makes things easier.

547
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:33,622
Whatever he has you doing, stop.

548
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:34,573
You told him?

549
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:36,241
We do live together.

550
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:38,827
I generally tell him when
I show up at his work.

551
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,963
He told me it was a
matter of life and death.

552
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,047
It is.

553
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:44,049
Patient wants to kill herself.

554
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,300
<i>He's just trying to read a book,</i>

555
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,469
<i>the latest Jack Cannon: Boy Detective.</i>

556
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:49,138
Alice Tanner is your patient?

557
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:50,389
You're a "fannon" too?

558
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:52,007
I'm team Deacon.

559
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,592
Oh, come on.

560
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:56,228
Why can't she love them both?

561
00:24:56,312 --> 00:24:58,764
The typewriter keys should
have left impressions

562
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,349
on these ribbon fibers.

563
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,518
They would also
remove a layer of ink.

564
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:06,188
It's just a question of
tweaking the software, really.

565
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,613
Does Cuddy know you're
using the MRI for this?

566
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:16,665
Let's say yes.

567
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:23,956
<i>So do you think Jack finally</i>

568
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,290
<i>hooks up with Sarah in this one?</i>

569
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,443
<i>No. Debbie Wright is his true love.</i>

570
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,329
She's dead. Presumed!

571
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,014
All we really know is--

572
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:34,099
there are actual patients
waiting to use this machine.

573
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,990
<i>Congratulations.</i>

574
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:44,526
It's a book.

575
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:52,067
Wilson just told me we're
going on a double date

576
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:54,035
with him and Sam tonight.

577
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:55,971
You don't like double dates?

578
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:57,873
I'd just like if
you'd ask me first.

579
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,424
You don't like surprises?

580
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:02,878
Is this Alice's book?

581
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,713
Sam reprogrammed the MRI

582
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:07,182
to read Alice's typewriter ribbon.

583
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,268
You used a $3 million piece
of hospital equipment

584
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:10,819
so you could read a novel?

585
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:13,522
Cool, right?

586
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,991
Well, as your girlfriend,
I'm impressed.

587
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:17,910
As your boss, you're a jackass.

588
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,895
Don't do it again.

589
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:21,029
As your boyfriend, I thank you.

590
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
As your employee, I resent you,

591
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,115
because I need this for my case.

592
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,366
As your boss,

593
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:27,536
you just got six more
clinic hours next week.

594
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:29,738
So what's the plan for tonight?

595
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,590
<i>Whatever you want. I don't care.</i>

596
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:33,008
Just pick something
we'd both enjoy.

597
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:34,459
Yeah? And what would
that be exactly?

598
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,661
<i>I don't know. You know what I like.</i>

599
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,412
I got to get back to work.

600
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,070
Found something.

601
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:48,106
It's not a tumor.

602
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,442
Whatever it is,
it's encased around her heart.

603
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:58,395
<i>She has a pericardial effusion.</i>

604
00:26:58,396 --> 00:26:59,680
<i> Which wasn't there last night</i>

605
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:00,298
when we did the PET scan.

606
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:01,139
She's getting worse,

607
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,925
and there's no sign
of a pheochromocytoma.

608
00:27:02,993 --> 00:27:04,660
<i>Seizures, sweating,
rapid blood pressure,</i>

609
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:06,161
and an effusion point
to something viral.

610
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:08,848
Or maybe a cancer.

611
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,266
We could use your opinion, House,

612
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:14,336
or at least your attention.

613
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:17,890
Jack Cannon is not dead.

614
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:19,475
It's worse.

615
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:22,778
Ten books leading up to
a final confrontation.

616
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,947
She ends it on a cliffhanger.

617
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:26,032
I mean, who does that?

618
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:27,967
People who want to
sell you the 11th.

619
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:29,068
<i>She was gonna kill herself.</i>

620
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:30,736
This is the final Jack Cannon.

621
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:32,455
Nothing gets resolved.

622
00:27:32,522 --> 00:27:34,857
<i>Who's his father?
Who killed his brother?</i>

623
00:27:34,908 --> 00:27:37,192
How'd he get that damn
scar on his cheek,

624
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:39,662
and why is he obsessed with yo-yos?

625
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:41,781
Is there anything in it
that pertains to our case?

626
00:27:41,848 --> 00:27:43,883
Yeah.

627
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:47,053
I know why she wanted
to kill herself.

628
00:27:47,137 --> 00:27:50,973
His mentor, Helen Rutherford,

629
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,342
has contracted a serious illness

630
00:27:53,393 --> 00:27:56,095
which consists of joint paint,

631
00:27:56,163 --> 00:27:58,848
<i>fatigue, sensitivity to light,</i>

632
00:27:58,915 --> 00:28:01,217
and depression.

633
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:04,219
How do we know this mentor
character's really Alice?

634
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:07,106
Helen dies halfway
through the book.

635
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,558
Shoots herself in the head...

636
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:12,028
To save Jack from
having to care for her.

637
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,863
<i> If we add those to the sympto
ms we've seen</i>

638
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:16,499
and the pericardial
effusion...It's lupus.

639
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:19,552
Can't be lupus.

640
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:21,504
Why not?

641
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:23,072
It isn't curable.

642
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,091
That's...Not an answer.

643
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:26,659
It's treatable.

644
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:28,044
<i>We'll start testing to s
ee which drugs</i>

645
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:29,428
<i>she best responds to.</i>

646
00:28:29,513 --> 00:28:31,413
We're not gonna be able
to take her pain away.

647
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:33,049
She's still gonna kill herself

648
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,685
as soon as she gets
released tomorrow.

649
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:40,539
Can't let Jack Cannon end this way.

650
00:28:40,607 --> 00:28:43,059
We're treating a patient...
Not a book.

651
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:50,082
Retest to confirm.

652
00:28:57,507 --> 00:29:00,309
Go-carts? Really?

653
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:02,211
<i>Wilson, party of four.
You guys are up next.</i>

654
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,929
Your mom said you loved go-carts.

655
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:06,982
You called my mother.

656
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,734
I loved them when I was 12.

657
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,686
<i>This is so cool!</i>

658
00:29:10,737 --> 00:29:12,554
I haven't done this since I was 12!

659
00:29:12,606 --> 00:29:15,608
Winner picks the restaurant.

660
00:29:15,692 --> 00:29:19,328
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

661
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:21,414
Are we ready, racers?

662
00:29:26,636 --> 00:29:28,170
On your marks,

663
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:29,872
get set...

664
00:29:29,923 --> 00:29:31,891
And go away.

665
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:39,214
Hey! Watch it!

666
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:43,185
You having fun?

667
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:45,354
You know who wins these races?

668
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:47,907
The person who weighs less!

669
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:53,612
My parents never let
me drive one of these!

670
00:29:53,697 --> 00:29:55,364
Yeah! I can tell!

671
00:29:57,451 --> 00:29:58,784
Oh, my God!

672
00:29:58,869 --> 00:29:59,919
Oh!

673
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:05,541
Oh!

674
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:10,379
Whoa.

675
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:14,266
What is her problem?

676
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:15,718
She hates jews!

677
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,588
Never...Again.

678
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:38,958
That a girl!

679
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:50,970
Ohh... Uh...

680
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:56,091
Hoo hoo hah hah hah!

681
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:12,408
See you at the finish line!

682
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:13,442
Oh, yeah?

683
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,141
Yes!

684
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:50,196
<i>Hey!</i>

685
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,014
You're banned for life, mister!

686
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:54,867
Your Fun Stop privileges
are officially revoked!

687
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,955
You, too, blondie!
All of you--get out!

688
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:02,041
I avenged my Lady.

689
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,959
Seatbelt nearly broke my neck.

690
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:05,411
I'm done for the night.

691
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:08,130
It's not my fault Wilson's
attracted to psychos.

692
00:32:08,197 --> 00:32:09,698
You picked the place.

693
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:13,886
That's just the pain talking.

694
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:21,227
Oh...Wow.

695
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:32,404
It was a car crash.

696
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:33,839
Not a skiing accident.

697
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:34,840
What?

698
00:32:34,908 --> 00:32:36,242
Screws in your leg.

699
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:38,727
Ya got me.

700
00:32:38,795 --> 00:32:40,395
I'll be going back to sleep now.

701
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,748
You damaged your thyroid
gland in the crash

702
00:32:42,816 --> 00:32:45,084
when the shoulder strap
cut into your neck.

703
00:32:45,151 --> 00:32:46,969
You don't have lupus.

704
00:32:47,037 --> 00:32:48,454
What you have is curable.

705
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:49,905
Go away.

706
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:53,959
I read your book.

707
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:55,961
Sucks, by the way.

708
00:32:56,046 --> 00:32:58,764
Nice try, but impossible.

709
00:32:58,848 --> 00:33:01,550
Helen Rutherford kills herself

710
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:03,218
because she feels useless

711
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,355
and doesn't want to be a burd--

712
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:08,057
just like you do now.

713
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:10,225
You have hypothyroidism.

714
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:12,278
That's why you feel
so tired and worn out.

715
00:33:12,345 --> 00:33:14,863
With medication,
you'll feel 20 years younger.

716
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:16,115
Or whatever age you were

717
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:17,733
the last time you didn't
want to kill yourself.

718
00:33:17,784 --> 00:33:19,935
How did you-- you can finish
the story the right way...

719
00:33:19,986 --> 00:33:21,654
The way Jack Cannon deserves.

720
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:24,623
You think you know
what Jack deserves?

721
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,659
I know that he deserves
better than what you gave him.

722
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:28,961
You don't know anything about him!

723
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:30,162
Why can't you just leave me--

724
00:33:38,088 --> 00:33:39,588
what did you do to me?

725
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,724
<i>I can't move.</i>

726
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:44,143
I can't move anything.

727
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:51,748
How can I be right and wrong?

728
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:53,284
<i>I deduced the car accident</i>

729
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:55,023
because thyroid fit the symptoms.

730
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:59,150
But a damaged thyroid wouldn't
explain the paralysis.

731
00:33:59,218 --> 00:34:00,685
How can I be wrong
about the thyroid

732
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:02,136
but right about the accident?

733
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:03,721
What if you're not?

734
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:05,807
I like the way you think, kid.

735
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:07,542
At least not completely.

736
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,444
<i>Post traumatic</i>

737
00:34:09,495 --> 00:34:11,746
syringomyelia from a
15-year-old car crash.

738
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:13,881
<i>Slowly growing over the years,</i>

739
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,533
<i>pressing against her spinal column.</i>

740
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:18,269
<i>Causes pain, fluctuating blood pressure,
seizures.</i>

741
00:34:18,337 --> 00:34:19,537
And if untreated,

742
00:34:19,605 --> 00:34:21,272
eventually leads to
paralysis and death.

743
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,491
<i> We find it and remove it.</i>

744
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,093
She should be able to
regain full function.

745
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,994
If we can get her medical
records from back then,

746
00:34:27,046 --> 00:34:29,397
we can use them to
pinpoint the location.

747
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:30,998
Do it.

748
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,384
We're dead on our feet.

749
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,353
I've barely slept in four days.

750
00:34:35,437 --> 00:34:36,804
Aw...That's sad.

751
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:38,506
You know what's even sadder?

752
00:34:38,557 --> 00:34:40,475
Thirteen was the
only man on my team.

753
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:41,809
Yeah, it'd be nice if you hurry up

754
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,012
and hire someone to fill her spot.

755
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,747
Do it.

756
00:34:45,814 --> 00:34:47,949
Cuddy wants it to be a girl.

757
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:49,867
There are a couple of people--

758
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:51,219
<i>I was talking to Chase.</i>

759
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:53,755
I was just looking at
you to screw with you.

760
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:04,632
I'm meditating.

761
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,934
From where we're standing,
it looked like sleeping.

762
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:09,170
<i>We can't find her old medical records.</i>

763
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:10,521
You woke me up for that?

764
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:12,757
We woke you up because
it doesn't matter.

765
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:14,926
Alice is refusing
any more treatment.

766
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,144
<i>She doesn't want the surgery.</i>

767
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:18,012
<i> She kicked us out.</i>

768
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:22,350
Why would she lie
about the accident?

769
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:24,018
Everybody lies.

770
00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:27,188
Everybody has a reason.

771
00:35:32,894 --> 00:35:34,629
I know.

772
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,914
Alice is refusing surgery.

773
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:38,750
She'll be dead in a
few days without it.

774
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,251
<i>Which is why I've spent
the last four hours</i>

775
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:44,122
trying to find a legal way to
do it without her permission.

776
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:47,041
Unsuccessfully. I'm sorry.

777
00:35:47,092 --> 00:35:49,877
As your boyfriend,
I'm grateful for the effort.

778
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:51,379
As your employee,

779
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,964
I'm disappointed at
your ineffectiveness.

780
00:35:56,635 --> 00:35:59,237
Why would she not tell us
about the pins in her leg?

781
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:02,023
'Cause she wants to die.

782
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,474
By having her leg ripped off?

783
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:06,477
She wants to punish herself...

784
00:36:06,562 --> 00:36:08,796
For something that happened
before she was famous,

785
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:10,531
<i>before she even started to write.</i>

786
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,383
<i>I think the answer's</i>

787
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:13,785
in her old medical records.

788
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:16,904
But dopey, sleazy,
and uptighty can't find them.

789
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:18,990
Maybe Alice Tanner's
just her pen name.

790
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:25,012
Your boyfriend is an idiot.

791
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,165
I'll contact the
national records archive

792
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:28,833
and run the type of
screws in her leg

793
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:32,537
against blood type, age,
and anything else I think of.

794
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:34,155
Her first name could be Helen.

795
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:36,174
Even better.

796
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:41,262
Don't bother to get up.

797
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,015
<i>You know, the way you
write Jack</i>

798
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:47,151
always made him feel real to me.

799
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:48,436
Now I know why.

800
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:53,424
Because I'm a good writer.

801
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:56,527
He's cool, but he's awkward.

802
00:36:56,612 --> 00:36:58,646
He's brilliant. He makes mistakes.

803
00:36:58,697 --> 00:37:02,166
He's funny, but sometimes
he takes it too far.

804
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:04,135
Sounds like a great kid.

805
00:37:04,203 --> 00:37:06,220
Please.

806
00:37:06,288 --> 00:37:08,105
Just leave me alone.

807
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:10,958
You weren't alone in the car crash.

808
00:37:11,026 --> 00:37:14,579
Your son was with you, Helen.

809
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:25,940
The books are your way
of keeping him alive.

810
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:32,814
Why can't you just
let me die in peace?

811
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:35,066
You haven't been at
peace since it happened.

812
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:43,474
I killed him.

813
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,860
<i>No, you didn't.</i>

814
00:37:45,928 --> 00:37:48,796
I let him drive.

815
00:37:48,864 --> 00:37:51,632
He only had a learner's permit.

816
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,985
It was raining.

817
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:56,203
I deserve this.

818
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:58,506
No, you don't.

819
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:05,313
He could always get me
to do what he wanted.

820
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,867
He's always been my muse.

821
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:11,602
Well, that may be true,

822
00:38:11,687 --> 00:38:13,220
but I've been reviewing

823
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:16,357
your muse's autopsy results.

824
00:38:16,408 --> 00:38:18,593
It wasn't the crash
that killed him.

825
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,162
<i>Your son had a brain aneurism.</i>

826
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:23,514
<i>That's why he crashed.</i>

827
00:38:23,582 --> 00:38:25,566
He was dead before the impact.

828
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:27,702
<i>There was nothing you could
do to save him.</i>

829
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:29,654
They would have told me.

830
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:31,038
They had no reason
to dig any deeper.

831
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:33,407
It was a car accident. I did.

832
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,960
It's easy to miss.

833
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:38,713
But you can see the
blood buildup here.

834
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:40,798
Your son would have died that day

835
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:43,584
on a bus, in school,

836
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:46,003
sitting on his bed.

837
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:49,256
The only thing the crash
is killing is you.

838
00:38:49,308 --> 00:38:52,677
We need to repair that
syrinx in your neck.

839
00:38:55,731 --> 00:38:58,149
He was my world.

840
00:38:58,233 --> 00:39:01,652
Writing...

841
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,071
I could feel him with me.

842
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:10,811
It wasn't my fault, mom.

843
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:16,133
And it wasn't mine.

844
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:38,773
Her son didn't have
a brain aneurism.

845
00:39:38,824 --> 00:39:40,841
Nope.

846
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:43,878
She shouldn't have let
him drive in the rain.

847
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:46,631
Jack was never very coordinated.

848
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:48,215
As your boss,

849
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:51,302
I am opposed to you
lying to a patient.

850
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:53,253
As your girlfriend,
I'm glad you care.

851
00:39:53,305 --> 00:39:55,840
I don't.

852
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,808
I just wanted to save Jack Cannon.

853
00:39:57,893 --> 00:40:01,228
Well, I can see why you like him.

854
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:04,264
I started reading one of
the books you gave me.

855
00:40:04,316 --> 00:40:06,400
I find that very hard to believe.

856
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:07,585
Why?

857
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:09,203
Because I can't like
something you like?

858
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,572
We couldn't possibly
have something in common?

859
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,908
Because I lied about
giving you the books.

860
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:14,992
Oh. Oh.

861
00:40:17,212 --> 00:40:18,846
Wilson told you. Yeah.

862
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:20,798
He's such a gossip.

863
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:23,017
I'm not gonna dump you because
we like different food

864
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:24,735
or books or music.

865
00:40:24,803 --> 00:40:26,303
On the other hand,

866
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:28,756
I might dump you if
you don't talk to me

867
00:40:28,807 --> 00:40:30,858
when you have a problem
with our relationship.

868
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:32,710
I know you believe that now...

869
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:34,428
But the fact is--

870
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:35,763
who cares about common?

871
00:40:35,814 --> 00:40:37,748
Common is boring.

872
00:40:37,816 --> 00:40:40,434
It's...Common!

873
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:44,321
I like being with you.
You make me better.

874
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:47,108
Hopefully, I make you better.

875
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:49,510
What we have is...

876
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:51,796
Uncommon.

877
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:57,368
And I've never been happier.

878
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:13,967
Mind giving us a moment alone,
Christina?

879
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:23,828
I'd like to thank you.

880
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:25,913
Great.

881
00:41:25,981 --> 00:41:28,349
You can dedicate the
next Jack Cannon to me.

882
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,117
I can't.

883
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:32,219
<i>Are you still in pain? No.</i>

884
00:41:32,287 --> 00:41:35,106
You did everything you said,
and more.

885
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:37,341
I can finally move on.

886
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:39,243
Thank you.

887
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:40,745
Move on where?

888
00:41:42,297 --> 00:41:45,633
I want to write books for adults.

889
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,418
What about Jack?

890
00:41:47,486 --> 00:41:50,154
<i>Your last book didn't answer anything.</i>

891
00:41:50,222 --> 00:41:53,474
The way I ended Jack's
story is perfect.

892
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,826
<i>Each reader can decide</i>

893
00:41:55,894 --> 00:41:58,846
what fate they want
for him themselves.

894
00:41:58,897 --> 00:42:00,614
You--but that's stupid!

895
00:42:00,682 --> 00:42:02,366
That doesn't make any sense!

896
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:05,853
How many answers do
you get in real life?

897
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:07,421
This is a book.

898
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:09,874
Books have beginnings,
middles, and ends.

899
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:11,325
You can't just leave
it on a cliffhanger--

900
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:12,359
who does that?

901
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,279
I'm sorry. His story's done.

902
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:20,718
There's really nothing you
can say to change my mind.

903
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:25,539
Your son...

904
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,250
Was very lucky to have
