1
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:36,312
You made your point.
Now how'bout letting us do our jobs?

2
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:39,580
Our point'll be made when your company
stops tearing down this mountain.

3
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,927
- Then who's gonna feed our kids? You?
- If you really cared about your kids,

4
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:45,429
you'd want them to have air
to breathe when they grow up.

5
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:48,506
- What'd you say, you son of a bitch?
- You guys aren't the problem.

6
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,466
You're being hurt more than anyone.

7
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:52,426
You breathe in that coal dust.

8
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:54,553
Coal is the dirtiest
energy on earth.

9
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,724
Gonna need some backup.

10
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:00,977
Not enough for you thugs
to assault the environment?

11
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,602
Doug, please, don't.

12
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,233
Susan? Susan! You okay?

13
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,215
She needs to get to a hospital.

14
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,095
She's dehydrated.
We have medics here.

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,284
- Let 'em give her fluids.
- She has no pulse.

16
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:21,130
Either unhook your arm,
or I'm gonna break it off.

17
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:22,998
Either way, this protest is over.

18
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,007
All right.

19
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:40,850
- What happened?
- You passed out.

20
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:42,393
It's okay.

21
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,145
Just stay hydrated.

22
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,046
You know we'll be back.

23
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,490
We'll be back!

24
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:03,490
Stop screwing around.

25
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:05,624
I'm not... screwing around.
I just can't...

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,502
Can't...

27
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:13,799
I can't stand up.

28
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,394
House - Season 05 Episode 21
"Saviors"

29
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,469
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm

30
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:50,753
The HTeam's AnonymHouse

31
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,017
- I need to push back our getaway.
- No, you don't.

32
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:07,436
Found you a board.
Perfect size to learn on.

33
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,952
I'm just postponing.
Olandt from philly general

34
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:11,862
wants me to get a patient
in to see House.

35
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:14,084
- So?
- I owe him a favor.

36
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,737
He's taken about a dozen
of my referrals over the last year.

37
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:20,366
I meant so that's five seconds
to hand House the file,

38
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,685
30 for him to question
your real motives,

39
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,378
a minute for witty comments
comparing the length of your legs

40
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:28,249
to Thirteen's...
plenty of time left over for the shore.

41
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,359
I need to make sure he doesn't toss
the file as soon as I'm out of sight.

42
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:34,231
Baby, can't repay the favor
on another case?

43
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:37,216
After last week, I could really
use a break from this place.

44
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:39,009
We both could.

45
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,002
Once I'm sure
he's really on the case,

46
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,305
then we're out of here.

47
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,268
And these legs and every
other part of me will be all yours.

48
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,875
He's seen three different
specialists.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,100
Interesting.

50
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:58,654
Almost as interesting as you trying
to step into Kutner's shoes

51
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,531
just days after
he stepped out of them.

52
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,492
I am not shoe shopping.

53
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,035
I'm just trying to repay a favor
to his referring doctor.

54
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:07,755
What's the mystery?
The nut case spends all his free time

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,724
wreaking havoc at toxic waste dumps.

56
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,063
Tox screen's negative.

57
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:14,286
No neurological, muscular,
or cardiovascular abnormalities.

58
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,964
The guys cares about the environment?
That makes him a nut case?

59
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,151
He's a single guy in his 20s.
He cares about getting his hybrid waxed

60
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,140
by girls who care
about the environment.

61
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:23,512
See? Not a nut case.

62
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,866
He's probably faking
so he can sue the cops

63
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,243
- and get a six-figure settlement.
- If it was true,

64
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,559
why would he consent to be seen by
the best diagnostician in the country?

65
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:34,148
Now who's trying to get
her hybrid waxed?

66
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,960
We need to do
a vestibular caloric test.

67
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:39,915
See if the balance problem
starts above or below the neck.

68
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,281
And when I say "we," I mean "you."

69
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:45,284
You're the one with the favor
to repay, not them.

70
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:54,603
I'm going to be injecting ice water
in your ear canal.

71
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,836
If the resulting eye movements
are at all erratic,

72
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:59,523
then the balance problem
is in your inner ear.

73
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,148
Those in every room?

74
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:04,568
- I think so.
- Can you get rid of them?

75
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,787
Preferably from every room?

76
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:10,442
They use over 30 pesticides
to grow commercial flowers.

77
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,229
- The medical industry would be more...
- Concerned with medicine?

78
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,949
Let's fix your body, and you can
go back to fixing the earth.

79
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:19,462
- This is gonna get uncomfortable.
- I spent 14 hours chained to a tire.

80
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,571
- Most doctors would recommend...
- Our planet's headed for destruction.

81
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:25,820
Coastlines under water,
a million species extinct.

82
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,787
Feels like I'm tumbling
ad over heels.

83
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,645
That's normal... sometimes
this test causes vertigo.

84
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:36,292
And nausea.

85
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,132
Cameron just brought me a case.

86
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,676
Cameron is happy in the e.r.

87
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,064
There's no way she wants her nose
back on your grindstone.

88
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:50,512
Egg white omelet, no bacon,
whole wheat toast.

89
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,036
I say it's not my grindstone
she's after

90
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:54,929
and not her nose she wants on it.

91
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,904
She and Chase are practically
living together.

92
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,359
- What did you just order?
- An omelet.

93
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,388
Since when do you pass on the swine?

94
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:08,408
And wheat toast?

95
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:10,744
Might as well eat
a sheet of sandpaper.

96
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,789
Yes, but I don't like eating
the same thing two days in a row.

97
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,750
Your bro's nurse
not lovin' the love handles?

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,619
I'm just not in the mood for bacon.

99
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,213
And you're obviously trying to avoid
talking about Kutner,

100
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,817
which is odd, because you spent
a whole week obsessing about why...

101
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:26,742
He's no longer on my team.

102
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:30,835
I'm sorry he's no longer on my team.
Nothing else to talk about.

103
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,265
You're wearing the watch
he gave you for secret santa.

104
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:37,789
Five functions,
including a stopwatch

105
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:40,396
to time how long it takes you
to ask me if I'm okay.

106
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:42,984
You gonna order?

107
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:46,104
Not hungry.

108
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,336
It's just weird.
She's brought cases before,

109
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:54,138
but he's never made her
run the tests.

110
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:57,167
Maybe he's looking for someone
to mother him after what happened.

111
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,169
Only kind of mothering House wants
involves a bullwhip, leather diapers,

112
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,890
and a credit card.

113
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,381
Mommy's home.

114
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:10,713
Test made the patient lose his lunch,
but his calorics are normal,

115
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:13,203
his inner ear is fine,
and he still can't balance himself.

116
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:14,983
How many normal test
results do we need

117
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:17,061
to know the patient's
a granola-filled phony?

118
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,897
- He's not lying about his symptoms.
- And you know this because...

119
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,482
she changed her shoes.

120
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,943
If he was faking, he'd have vomited
on the other side of the bed.

121
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:28,697
Sparring with the police and chaining
yourself up for days can cause stress.

122
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:30,754
Stress screws with
the heart and arteries.

123
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,160
Carotid atherosclerosis
could cause a loss of balance.

124
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,438
Wouldn't show up on CT or MRI.

125
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:38,332
Could also be our only
warning before a massive stroke.

126
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:41,169
Do a holter and a carotid doppler.

127
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,587
See if his heart skips for more
than the spotted owl.

128
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,907
Although I didn't say "we."

129
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:48,241
If I had...

130
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,975
Sorry if this
is screwing up the test.

131
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,111
I've been hiccupping a lot
lately, but... not as bad as this.

132
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,446
How much is "a lot"
and how long is "lately"?

133
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:11,942
It's been on and off
for about a week.

134
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,767
Maybe a few hours a day.

135
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,554
Did you tell the doctors
in philly about it?

136
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:19,136
They didn't seem to think
it was any big deal.

137
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,422
So we're still leaving
tomorrow, aren't we?

138
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,525
I'm not sure.

139
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:31,894
The referring doctors didn't
realize that his hiccups were...

140
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,019
Hiccups?

141
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:36,533
With this duration and intensity,
mostly likely pathological,

142
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:38,708
and it could mean it's serious.

143
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,625
- Are you avoiding me?
- No.

144
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:44,065
So I shouldn't be at all concerned

145
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,550
that you're treating another
doctor's patient for hiccups

146
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:49,695
instead of going on a vacation
I spent a week planning.

147
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:55,259
There is a reason
I need to stay with this case

148
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:58,755
a while longer,
but I can't tell you what it is.

149
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,316
So... you admit you lied to me.

150
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,835
And now you're
asking me to trust you?

151
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,413
Yes.

152
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,619
No sign of heart
or arterial problems,

153
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:27,833
but he's been hiccupping
on and off for over a week.

154
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,308
Nice! I'm hooked.

155
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,029
You can get back to your shift
at the e.r.

156
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:35,024
Except, as far as the e.r. is concerned,
you're on vacation, right?

157
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,610
I postponed a trip because
I'm concerned about the patient.

158
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:40,096
Explains why you ditched Chase
and came to the differentials,

159
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:42,273
- not why you ran the tests.
- You told me to.

160
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm not your boss, as you usually take
great pleasure in pointing out.

161
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,346
You don't still have
the hots for me, do you?

162
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:53,313
I care about the patient, and I care
about the people who work on your team.

163
00:09:53,438 --> 00:09:55,552
They've been through a lot lately.
I just thought...

164
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:56,995
Was florence nightingale.

165
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,352
You're gonna nurse us back
to spiritual and mental oneness.

166
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:01,892
Would make sense if we were
having this conversation a week ago.

167
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,194
Think what you want...
that I'm here to get a job,

168
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:06,747
that I'm here to wrap you
in swaddling clothes.

169
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:08,982
The problem is, I think neither.

170
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:10,960
Because neither makes sense.

171
00:10:11,468 --> 00:10:13,318
The only thing that does...

172
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:14,905
doesn't.

173
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:24,915
Pathological hiccups
plus inability to balance... go.

174
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,377
What she said.

175
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,129
Brain would connect the two.

176
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,217
It could, if cameron hadn't
already ct'd his head.

177
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,695
Empty as her boyfriend's calendar.

178
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,512
What does this have
to do with Chase?

179
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:40,264
- Nothing.
- Not sure yet.

180
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:42,925
Patient is on a jihad
against commercial flowers.

181
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,269
He's picketed several nurseries.
Organophosphate poisoning

182
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,431
- can cause both hiccups and...
- No g.i. problems, no hyper-salivation.

183
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:50,440
It's possible
it's not connected to a protest.

184
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:53,637
M.s. wouldn't show on the CT,
and his name's Swenson.

185
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:56,363
Scandinavians have an increased
susceptibility to m.s.

186
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,180
Better theory than he's faking it.

187
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:01,110
The clogs have it.

188
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:02,953
Do a lumbar puncture to confirm m.s.

189
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:08,750
I guess we'll just continue
to twiddle our thumbs.

190
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,462
God, I hope that's a euphemism.

191
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,725
How I'm supposed to do a lumbar puncture
on a patient with intractable hiccups?

192
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,844
I'm trying to figure out what
that could be a euphemism for.

193
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,878
You'll find a way.

194
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:30,689
You're not worried House is gonna be
pissed you're helping me do the test?

195
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,941
He said find a way, and you did.

196
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:36,695
- How do you think House is doing?
- That why you're here?

197
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,317
No, it isn't.

198
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:44,745
Even if house was messed up
by Kutner's suicide, it wouldn't matter.

199
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,539
He already thinks life
is nasty, brutish, and long.

200
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:50,167
And misery helps
his diagnostic skills.

201
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:52,429
All of which you know, so...

202
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,797
- why are you here?
- Which answer would you believe?

203
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,258
If you want Kutner's place,
it's fine by me.

204
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:01,011
I could use someone else with
the stones to stand up to House.

205
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:05,223
But you've gotta know it's gonna blow up
your relationship with Chase.

206
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,060
All I did was postpone
a three-day trip.

207
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,871
With Chase, to be with House.

208
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:16,526
- What are you doing?
- Ordering i.v. chlorpromazine.

209
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:19,613
This could still be neurological.
You could cloud his mental status.

210
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,741
You wanna get the needle
in his spine or you wanna talk?

211
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:33,744
You and House been talking
about filling Kutner's slot?

212
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:36,922
Yeah, we went straight
from the funeral to human resources.

213
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:40,884
You interested in getting
back on the team?

214
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,336
I'm interested in knowing
if Cameron's interested.

215
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:46,056
She's been running all the tests
for House's case.

216
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,284
Well, she hasn't said
anything to me.

217
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,844
But I guess, the referring doctor

218
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,669
might have asked her
to keep an eye on him.

219
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,940
Do you think Cameron's
in love with House?

220
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:02,406
That is a ridiculous question.
She's in love with you.

221
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,183
Are you in love with House?

222
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,910
That...

223
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,070
is an even more ridiculous question.

224
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:13,723
Two questions, zero answers.

225
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,587
Think I can extrapolate from there.

226
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,440
Sorry, I'm just
the zone delivery guy.

227
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:39,234
I'm, Doug Swenson's wife.

228
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:44,739
His history said the environmental
kamikaze was single.

229
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:47,468
He... he probably didn't
want me to worry.

230
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,212
He told me he was in jail with
some of the other protters.

231
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:51,913
Yeah, no worries there.

232
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:54,373
He's... in jail a lot.

233
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,127
Not so often in the hospital.

234
00:13:57,594 --> 00:14:00,314
I searched his email, and I found
the referral to you yesterday.

235
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,767
You must really love your husband.
And travel by rickshaw.

236
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:06,342
It only took you
18 hours to get here.

237
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,541
Who eats kale?

238
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,351
It's so bland,
it doesn't even taste like kale.

239
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:16,771
I had to find somebody to take care
of our four-year-old son.

240
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,484
- Doug's all right, isn't he?
- I have no idea.

241
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,978
I know he's an idiot.

242
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:25,532
And now I've learned that he's a liar.
So we're making a...

243
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:30,152
- who told you that I was in here?
- The doctor in the office next to yours

244
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:32,177
said that you might be here.

245
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,170
I got it figured out.

246
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,700
- That mean we don't need to do the lp?
- I was talking to her.

247
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:46,510
- You're not even supposed to be here.
- You want us to stop or not?

248
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:47,511
What?

249
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:49,833
I don't care what you do with him.

250
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,932
You're not doing a favor
for a doctor in philly.

251
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,559
You're doing a favor for
an oncologist in north Jersey.

252
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,594
I'm spying on you for Wilson?

253
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,730
Spying, preemptive grief counseling.

254
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:00,941
Wilson sees you ten times
more than I do,

255
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,669
he's a better liar, and he wouldn't have
to cancel a vacation to do it.

256
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:06,712
Good points.

257
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,950
Also doesn't explain the diet.

258
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,371
What does any of this
have to do with my husband?

259
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:12,285
Nothing.

260
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,881
Meet mrs. Environmental nutbag.

261
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:18,583
- Or did you keep your maiden name?
- He's married?

262
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:20,669
Yep, got a kid too.
Double threat.

263
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,546
Eco-freak and deadbeat dad.

264
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:26,091
- Sorry... parentally challenged.
- No, his neck.

265
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:31,504
It's torticollis.
Reaction to the chlorpromazine.

266
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,431
It's not just a spasm.
It's swollen.

267
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,893
Crunchy.

268
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,625
It's definitely not m.s.

269
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:45,255
Crunching sounds were caused by
an air leak between his lungs.

270
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,849
Lead in his mediastinum could've
been caused by prolonged hiccups.

271
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:50,666
- More likely, it was the neck spasm.
- Maybe It was there all along.

272
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,396
We just didn't notice it till
the other symptoms made it worse.

273
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:56,107
What causes loss of balance,
pathological hiccups,

274
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:58,126
and a hole in his gloria steinem?

275
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:00,348
He was protesting
a lumber mill last fall.

276
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:04,140
- Sarcoid's been linked to pine forests.
- No, his a.c.e. Levels were normal.

277
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:06,006
Progressive systemic sclerosis?

278
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,095
Guy practically lives
at industrial waste sites.

279
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,918
If a solvent got absorbed through his
lungs, caused an autoimmune firestorm.

280
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:15,552
Start him on iv methyl-prednisolone
for systemic sclerosis.

281
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:17,976
- Do a full work-up to confirm.
- By myself?

282
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,227
Without yourself.

283
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,716
Grab a bat.

284
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:23,652
Grab some pine.

285
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:25,942
Time to bring in the first string.

286
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:32,702
Why?

287
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:36,280
You obviously want to be here.
I can't figure out why.

288
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:39,355
I wanna see where you go
when you can't be here.

289
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:03,409
You know what vacation means, right?

290
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,968
You're here because of House,
Chase, or overtime issues.

291
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,603
He's very concerned.

292
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:10,932
- Chase, not... House.
- If it's all right with you,

293
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:13,448
I'd rather communicate with Chase
by communicating with Chase.

294
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,037
Are you in love with House?

295
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,416
You... are not concerned about me.

296
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:26,503
You're marking your territory.

297
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,851
You shouldn't
be involved with House.

298
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:32,526
Neither should I.
Neither should anyone.

299
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,202
You and Chase are good together.
Just don't screw it up.

300
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:47,065
- When are you gonna stop this?
- How can you ask me to stop?

301
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,196
You're in a hospital.
You have a son.

302
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,697
The steroids ought to get him
breathing normally again.

303
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,445
But autoimmune diseases are serious.

304
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,120
It might not be a bad idea
to take some time at home, rest up.

305
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,663
I can't just quit.

306
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,667
Do you hate us that much?

307
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:07,188
I love you.

308
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,030
And I love our son.

309
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:13,562
But why should he matter more
than everyone else's?

310
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:16,082
- He does.
- Why??

311
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,806
Because he's biologically
connected to me?

312
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,341
There's no rational reason.

313
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:24,847
He's our son!

314
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:28,574
And he's gonna need
to drink clean water.

315
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,635
And breathe clean air.

316
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,004
I'm doing this for him too.

317
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:44,517
Come on in, House.

318
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,397
Because who else is it
going to be at 10:30 at night?

319
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:51,045
And no, thanks.
I already ate.

320
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:53,524
Didn't ask you to dinner.

321
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,694
But you were going to.

322
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:58,355
And when I explained
that I'd eaten hours ago,

323
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,976
you were going to move on
to your real entree,

324
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:02,951
rifling through my kitchen.

325
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:10,143
Inviting me to search your kitchen.

326
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:13,788
Means you know that I'd find nothing,
or you know that I'd find something,

327
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:17,338
you're hoping that I'm going to assume
the former and I won't bother to look.

328
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:22,438
Or it means it's late, I'm tired,

329
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:24,996
I know you're here to advance
some paranoid theory

330
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,041
based on a single egg white omelet,
and I'd like to get it over with

331
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,877
- so we can both go to sleep.
- Your single-omelet theory

332
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,467
conveniently overlooks the grassy knoll
you had for lunch today:

333
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:36,966
vegetable and grain gag-athon.

334
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,464
The warren commission found no evidence
of a second lunch,

335
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:43,184
possibly because it was stolen
from the doctor's lounge.

336
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,309
You're not getting any fatter.

337
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:47,446
Your medical records were clean.

338
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:49,976
- You checked my...
- You're alone tonight,

339
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,205
so it's Kutner.

340
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:56,861
How could Kutner
have any conceivable...

341
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,779
Your patients live,
your patients die.

342
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:01,804
You float above it all
like a medical colossus.

343
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:04,715
- But a fellow doctor dies...
- That's brilliant.

344
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,536
Kutner was a wake-up call
that if I didn't eat healthier,

345
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:09,123
I might kill myself.

346
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:11,479
Mortality is mortality.

347
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,617
And... ice cream...

348
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:17,210
is ice cream.

349
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,264
Full fat content.

350
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:22,532
Quadruple fat content.

351
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,851
Stuff you haven't eaten just
proves you haven't eaten it.

352
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,837
You were hoping for evidence
of stuff I have eaten?

353
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:33,390
First door on the right.

354
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:42,949
Excruciating pain in his left leg!
Acute onset about ten minutes ago.

355
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,872
What are you doing to him?

356
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,496
I assume they were checking
for vascular pulsations.

357
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:51,211
Either it's negative,
or he's a big wuss.

358
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:53,386
It's not a tumor or an aneurism!

359
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,421
Metabolic bone disease?

360
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,881
Bone density's normal!

361
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,732
But the bone covering might not be!

362
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:01,927
If it's osteomyelitis, an infection

363
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,304
- eating away at his periosteum...
- <i>That explains the pain.</i>

364
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:08,057
Odds are it's a subclinical infection
that we made it worse with the steroids.

365
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:10,387
Start him on IV antibiotics.

366
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:12,713
X-ray his legs
to confirm osteomyelitis.

367
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,898
Cameron's done
a full set of lower-body x-rays.

368
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,729
The infection obviously flared.
Do 'em again.

369
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:22,886
Even if I had changed my diet,

370
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:26,370
what possible reason could
I have for hiding it from you?

371
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,724
Ankle, tibia, fibula...
all look normal.

372
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:39,448
No inflammation, no signs of osteo.

373
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,150
<i>Hang in there.
We're almost done.</i>

374
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,641
You and your wife...
you talk about stuff?

375
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,640
Sex.

376
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,519
- No. Anything else?
- Money.

377
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,678
I'm gonna go way out on a limb here.

378
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,735
Foreman not a chatty Cathy?

379
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,884
Normally, it doesn't matter.

380
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:06,154
But last week it did.

381
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,616
You wanna date men,
good chance talking won't be...

382
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:18,028
his femur's fractured.

383
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:20,360
That's impossible.
It's the hardest bone in the body.

384
00:22:20,485 --> 00:22:22,590
And he broke it lying in bed.

385
00:22:31,286 --> 00:22:33,017
How can you have a broken femur

386
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,682
without so much as a bruise?

387
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:36,778
Whatever broke it
had to do it from within.

388
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,483
Osteogenesis imperfecta?

389
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,462
Brittle bones
wouldn't cause hiccups,

390
00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:42,782
plus, we'd have seen abnormal
coloring in the sclerae.

391
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:44,112
Which leaves cancer.

392
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,239
Since when does bone cancer
cause hiccups?

393
00:22:46,477 --> 00:22:48,271
Which means it's not bone cancer.

394
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,861
Or it's not cancer.

395
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:51,676
House is right.

396
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,915
It'd be hard to find a guy
outside Chernobyl

397
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,713
who'd been exposed
to more carcinogens.

398
00:22:55,838 --> 00:22:58,251
Pesticide plants,
nuclear waste sites.

399
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:03,005
Tell Chase to repair the break.
You two prep him for chemo.

400
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:05,632
You wanna blast him with chemo
for a cancer

401
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:07,343
- we don't even know he has?
- Nope

402
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,508
I wanna blast him with chemo
for a cancer that explains the symptoms.

403
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:18,718
Intramedullary nail.

404
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:20,898
Hold on.

405
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,062
That your House imitation?
Some late-breaking epiphany?

406
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:27,238
I just need you to get a bone biopsy
before you insert the pin.

407
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:30,268
- For a broken leg?
- House is prepping him for chemo.

408
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:33,411
Thought it might be worth checking
before pumping him full of poison.

409
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:37,707
- Does Cameron agree with House?
- Cameron isn't on the case anymore.

410
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:49,187
Still enjoying your day off, I see.

411
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:53,202
- Why are you prepping him for chemo?
- The more interesting question is

412
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:54,625
why do you care?

413
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,269
- You're not even sure that it's...
- Why do you care from here?

414
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,671
You can monitor the patient from home.
What's the difference between the two?

415
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:03,168
You're not at my home?

416
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:06,069
- This has nothing to do with...
- Any other differences?

417
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,355
Less medical equipment,
more training bras,

418
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:12,716
and more vegemite sandwiches.

419
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:15,787
Actually, technically,
right now, Chase is here.

420
00:24:16,376 --> 00:24:18,289
That's because you ignored
that I called him.

421
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:21,207
And it's irrelevant to my point,
which is...

422
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,461
which is...
you and Chase are over.

423
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:26,333
You are wrong.

424
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,548
You decided that his single drawer
of clothes is one drawer too many.

425
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:32,802
But you don't have
the guts to tell him,

426
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:34,900
so... you're emotionally
walking away...

427
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:37,005
instead of actually walking away.

428
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:40,951
Which is stupid, because only one
of those is good for your heart.

429
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:50,015
He's gonna ask me to marry him.

430
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,659
I... was looking
for some thick socks.

431
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:56,687
Found the ring.

432
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:01,059
And you want to say no?

433
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,668
So I circle right back
to his single drawer of clothes...

434
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:06,803
I don't want to say anything.
I don't want him to ask.

435
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:09,855
Not now.

436
00:25:11,862 --> 00:25:13,128
Couldn't hurt...

437
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:16,581
we're all a little freaked out.

438
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:19,657
We go home, we just
wanna hug someone.

439
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:22,045
We just wanna know everything's
gonna be okay.

440
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:28,810
I don't want him to propose
just 'cause he's scared.

441
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,535
She's got a headache, fever.
She's completely exhausted.

442
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:47,004
Tell him about your chest, honey.

443
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,715
Her breasts are really tender.

444
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:53,492
You guys have a hot tub?

445
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:57,555
- She must go to the gym a lot.
- Not in years.

446
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,681
Then maybe, when you
travel on business,

447
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:04,649
you zip on down
to that complimentary hotel spa...

448
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:09,650
- Sorry, did you just say yes?
- What the hell's wrong with her?

449
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,648
- Got a minute?
- He doesn't.

450
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,833
- What's wrong with her?
- Sorry.

451
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:18,531
I'm sure she's got a medical crisis,
and I need more time to figure out

452
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:20,633
some leading questions
for your wife.

453
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,045
- What's going on with Cameron?
- She doesn't want back on my team

454
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,821
and she doesn't want to jump me.

455
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:32,307
What?

456
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,783
You ask a question,

457
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:37,261
I rule out two possibilities,
and you're satisfied?

458
00:26:38,952 --> 00:26:40,651
That means you don't want an answer.

459
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:43,017
You just wanted to know there
wasn't a particular answer.

460
00:26:43,507 --> 00:26:45,330
Either you were worried
that she wanted back,

461
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:47,773
or you were worried
that she wanted back on me.

462
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:49,941
This isn't a medical crisis, is it?

463
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:52,648
Could be.

464
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:54,936
A lot of STDs hang in the balance.

465
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:02,598
I give up.

466
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:04,455
Vinegar compresses four times a day.

467
00:27:05,118 --> 00:27:07,270
Any chance I could just
leave it at that?

468
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,712
Pseudomomas folliculitis.

469
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:13,589
It's a skin infection

470
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,593
from crowded and contaminated
hot tubs,

471
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:18,970
which you obviously use,
but not with your husband.

472
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,573
Tried to help a sister out.

473
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,361
The nuclei were all normal sized.

474
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:33,605
Bone cells were well differentiated.

475
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,486
No dysplasia means no cancer.

476
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,032
That's good, isn't it?

477
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,207
We hope so.

478
00:27:38,344 --> 00:27:41,075
Although it also means we still have
no idea what caused the break.

479
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:42,917
How does it feel?

480
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,042
It hurts.

481
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,918
- Is it supposed to look like that?
- No, but it's probably

482
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:54,523
residual bleeding from the surgery.
We should be able to...

483
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:01,473
I need two units of FFP, right away!

484
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,156
My God!
What's happening?

485
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,431
He's bleeding out.

486
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:14,257
- Means it's gotta be cancer.
- It's gotta be, except it's not.

487
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:17,242
- The biopsy was negative.
- Biopsies can be wrong. Symptoms can't.

488
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:20,891
All signs point to cancer, but you can't
blast a cancer you can't find.

489
00:28:21,364 --> 00:28:22,514
Sure you can.

490
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:25,015
Prep him for total body irradiation.

491
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,038
You do realize that's insane.

492
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:30,499
Not unless you think the cancer's
cleverly hiding outside his body.

493
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,289
Steroids weakened his immune system.

494
00:28:32,414 --> 00:28:34,986
That much radiation will kill him
before it kills the cancer.

495
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:37,349
And if he doesn't have cancer,
we could cause one,

496
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:38,988
or destroy his system altogether.

497
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:40,556
He could die from an infection.

498
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:42,970
You'd rather do nothing,
just let him die on his own?

499
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,680
I'd rather make his cancer worse.

500
00:28:48,255 --> 00:28:49,935
Give him insulin-like growth factor,

501
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,895
make any tumor or malignancy grow.

502
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,391
- Grows big enough, we can find it.
- That's pouring gasoline on a fire.

503
00:28:55,516 --> 00:28:57,860
At least total body irradiation's
an actual treatment.

504
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:02,531
His idea is better.

505
00:29:03,193 --> 00:29:04,193
Pour away.

506
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:20,925
I lost my mojo.

507
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:23,928
Have you retraced your steps?

508
00:29:24,572 --> 00:29:26,639
Does your cleaning lady
check your pockets before...

509
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,493
I was clueless about Kutner.

510
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,910
I was wrong about Cameron.

511
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:35,106
Taub came up with an idea that I should
have seen long before he did.

512
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:37,608
No one saw anything coming
with Kutner.

513
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,741
You hardly ever see Cameron anymore.

514
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:42,779
And you hired Taub to come up with ideas
that you wouldn't have come up with.

515
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:45,908
And I have no idea
why you're eating carrots.

516
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,076
Good.

517
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,408
I'm losing my mind.
All you got to say is "good"?

518
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:53,337
House, a guy you worked with
for two years,

519
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:56,790
who you mentored and, yes,
possibly even cared about,

520
00:29:56,915 --> 00:29:58,528
just blew his brains out.

521
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,293
You can't find the reason,
can't find the meaning in it,

522
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,634
because sometimes there isn't any.
Sometimes...

523
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:06,424
this is all there is.

524
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,567
You should be losing it.

525
00:30:08,692 --> 00:30:10,516
You'd be crazy not to be
off your game.

526
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:13,561
But your mojo
is right where you left it.

527
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:15,935
Just... keep playing with it.

528
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,282
I gotta go.

529
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,584
Help yourself.

530
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,323
I know this is a tough process.

531
00:30:27,448 --> 00:30:29,774
At the first sign of any tumors
or masses, we can...

532
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:31,078
start saying prayers?

533
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,371
It's gonna be OK.
Once we can...

534
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:35,916
No, it's not gonna be okay.
You're growing his cancer.

535
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:38,085
This isn't the doctors' fault.

536
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:41,663
I've exposed myself
to a lot of bad stuff.

537
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:43,716
I knew the risks.

538
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:48,861
I want my life to mean something.

539
00:30:49,992 --> 00:30:52,066
If that means I'm destined to...

540
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:58,189
He's in v-tach and no pulse!
Grab the paddles!

541
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:03,383
Charging.

542
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,706
Clear!

543
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,489
Charging.

544
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:07,469
Clear.

545
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:11,962
I've been looking for you.

546
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,122
And... I've been thinking about you.

547
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:19,650
Just hadn't reached
the looking stage yet.

548
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:21,954
Which is the problem.

549
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:25,306
You asked for a day.

550
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:26,675
I gave you two.

551
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,136
You told me you had a secret
you couldn't share.

552
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:32,196
I respected that.
Now I don't know what's worse...

553
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:34,182
blowing off our vacation
to hang around House

554
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,877
or continuing to blow it off
when he won't hang around you.

555
00:31:37,002 --> 00:31:38,895
If you think I'm 
bit interested in House...

556
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,190
I don't know what
I'm supposed to think.

557
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:44,442
I know this looks bad, and...

558
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:47,508
I don't care how it looks.
I care what it is.

559
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,956
And you're not telling me
what it is.

560
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:52,259
I'm trying to trust you, but...

561
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,652
just...

562
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:03,504
I need a little more time.

563
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:11,461
This...

564
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,505
has nothing to do with House.

565
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,057
Yeah, well, it has nothing
to do with me, either.

566
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:19,917
Not anymore.

567
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:28,445
Let me know when I can come
pick up my things.

568
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:48,305
Nothing on the echo.

569
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,108
We drew a troponin level.
No signs of myocardial ischemia.

570
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:52,792
All the tests were normal.

571
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,150
Loss of balance.

572
00:32:55,298 --> 00:32:57,978
Pathological hiccups.
Air leak between the lungs.

573
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:00,894
Broken femur, now tachycardia.
Go!

574
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,825
Come on, give me something.
Give me a bad idea.

575
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,056
Maybe I could turn it
into a good one.

576
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:17,504
Fine.

577
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:19,622
Open him up, put in a defibrillator.

578
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:21,373
That's permanent and risky.

579
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:23,941
We don't even know what,
if anything is wrong with his heart.

580
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:25,198
Redo all the tests.

581
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:28,343
In the meantime, open him up,
put in a defibrillator...

582
00:33:28,947 --> 00:33:31,717
so he can live long enough
for you to finish the tests.

583
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:49,970
Balance organs, nerves,
lungs, bones, heart.

584
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:54,114
Things you use to make bratwurst.

585
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:57,568
There's no sign of infection.

586
00:33:58,133 --> 00:34:00,410
It's not a metabolic
or autoimmune disease.

587
00:34:01,024 --> 00:34:02,456
It's definitely not cancer.

588
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:05,178
- I think.
- Definitely not cancer.

589
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:09,389
Aren't you gonna pick?

590
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,506
I'm thinking.
Is there a ticking clock?

591
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,556
You already put your money in.

592
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,796
- You never do that until you decide.
- That's very observant of you.

593
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:21,100
Too bad you distracted me.
Now I'm...

594
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,760
thinking I might change my mind.

595
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:28,982
There's nothing healthy
in that machine.

596
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,364
No, there's not.

597
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,847
Gummi bears.

598
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:39,076
You hate gummi bears.

599
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,454
People can change.

600
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:45,990
More importantly, I hate them.

601
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:48,749
Fine...
then I won't offer you any.

602
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:53,882
You manipulative bitch.

603
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,034
You're not suddenly eating
healthy because you want to.

604
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,304
You're eating healthy because
you know I don't want to.

605
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:03,879
I've been mooching food
for ten years.

606
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:08,036
Now, either it suddenly started
bothering you this week

607
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,274
- or you're...
- screwing with you.

608
00:35:10,696 --> 00:35:12,246
It needed to be done.

609
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:15,332
After Amber died, I withdrew,

610
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:17,849
tried to change everything,
hoping I'd sort it out,

611
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:20,617
find some deeper truth.
It was a mistake.

612
00:35:21,338 --> 00:35:23,550
I should have gone back
to normal, to here and now,

613
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:26,279
because that's all we can
ever really count on.

614
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:29,900
Things need to get
back to normal in your life,

615
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:33,475
and what could be more normal
than me screwing with you...

616
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:36,056
and you figuring it out?

617
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:39,178
You manipulative bitch.

618
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,752
We need to put in
a cardioverter-defibrillator.

619
00:35:58,877 --> 00:36:01,431
It'll keep your heart beating
while we keep looking.

620
00:36:01,814 --> 00:36:02,997
What does that mean?

621
00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:06,054
It means, even if we
figure this out,

622
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:09,750
you'll have to stop protesting
anywhere not near a hospital.

623
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:15,879
Got a few questions.

624
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:17,781
We're about to start doing...

625
00:36:17,906 --> 00:36:19,883
A hopefully pointless
medical procedure.

626
00:36:20,008 --> 00:36:23,430
Your life and my mojo
hang in the balance.

627
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,236
Pesticides are evil.

628
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:28,931
Which means that commercial
flowers are dowsed in evil.

629
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,188
But plant life
is nature's answer to evil.

630
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:34,441
So you have a garden?

631
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,590
No, we live in an apartment.

632
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,656
- A window box, then?
- No.

633
00:36:43,064 --> 00:36:45,775
- Potted plants?
- Nothing, the commercial growers...

634
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,621
Yeah, they're evil. Got it.

635
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,499
House, I really don't think
we have the time for this.

636
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:54,776
Your marriage sucks.

637
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,282
Thank you.

638
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:01,986
All marriages suck.
Your marriage sucks.

639
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:03,511
I love her.

640
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:06,306
He loves a tree in Oregon
more than he loves you.

641
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:08,295
But he can't have sex with it.

642
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,709
Unless it's that slutty oak
outside Portland.

643
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:12,391
You wanna get to your point?

644
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:15,100
She's had enough.
She's gonna leave.

645
00:37:15,225 --> 00:37:17,182
Or maybe she's just not
putting out, whatever.

646
00:37:17,307 --> 00:37:19,409
You gotta make it right, right away.

647
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:22,937
You gotta compromise that
precious flower principle.

648
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:25,367
Never.

649
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,871
Once.

650
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:36,265
Three weeks ago.
Our anniversary.

651
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:39,255
I missed the dinner
to be at that rally.

652
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,999
You planned it for months.
You were mad.

653
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:43,591
Really mad.

654
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:45,679
I bought you flowers.

655
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:47,723
I brought them home.

656
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:51,101
And you were gone.
So was your suitcase.

657
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:54,611
I tossed them and bought you
the earrings.

658
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:56,667
Roses?

659
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,630
You have sporotrichosis.

660
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:06,875
It's an infection
from the thorn of the rose

661
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,454
which, by any other name,
is still a cheap marital aid.

662
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:14,343
- The flowers are what gave me...
- Lesion on your eighth cranial nerve

663
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:15,683
knocks out your balance.

664
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,402
Another on your phrenic nerve
gives you serial hiccups.

665
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:20,664
We then spread it to your bones
and heart with steroids

666
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:22,570
and insulin-like growth factor.

667
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,707
Please tell us
that this is good news.

668
00:38:25,466 --> 00:38:27,116
It's good news for him.

669
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:29,579
It's good news
for future generations.

670
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:31,243
It's crappy news for you.

671
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:32,935
He's gonna be fine.

672
00:38:33,774 --> 00:38:35,924
He'll never doubt himself again.

673
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:45,353
There you go.

674
00:38:49,851 --> 00:38:52,037
Damn, I was hoping I would
interrupt something.

675
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,985
Your favor's repaid.
Patient's cured.

676
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:01,311
He's already packing for another
Earth day extravaganza next week.

677
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:02,712
He almost died.

678
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:04,381
He can't take a few days?

679
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:06,249
People only change after trauma

680
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:08,874
if they wanted to change
before the trauma.

681
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,515
Or if they've watched too many
afterschool specials.

682
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:14,467
- You talking about Chase?
- I'm talking about you.

683
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,483
You lost husband number one.

684
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,355
No surprise that the death
of a colleague

685
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,942
would make you question another
long-term lease.

686
00:39:22,755 --> 00:39:25,487
You teaching commitment classes?
I thought you were too busy...

687
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,612
I'm sure that was going to be
hysterical. I give you the cliff notes.

688
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:30,840
Don't try to dump him
by dumping cases on me.

689
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,162
I told you I never
wanted to dump Chase.

690
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:37,674
Absolutely.
You want him to dump you.

691
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:39,343
It's totally different.

692
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:40,492
Much less guilt.

693
00:39:40,617 --> 00:39:43,269
Either way, you're out
of reasons to avoid him.

694
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:47,258
Kutner was a pretty dumb one
to begin with.

695
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:57,060
I should never have
postponed our vacation.

696
00:40:00,629 --> 00:40:02,024
I should never have planned it.

697
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,071
I found the ring in your sock.

698
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:17,588
I didn't want you to propose
out of some sort of...

699
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:20,049
knee-jerk reaction
to what happened to Kutner.

700
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:25,162
Guess you don't have
to worry about that anymore.

701
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:26,253
I'm not, I...

702
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,332
I don't care what happens.
I just...

703
00:40:31,457 --> 00:40:32,857
want it to happen.

704
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,810
Are you proposing to me?

705
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:41,088
I'm...

706
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:43,333
proposing that...

707
00:40:45,424 --> 00:40:46,943
you propose to me.

708
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:49,279
After I broke up with you?

709
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:52,020
After you ruined
my planned proposal,

710
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:54,332
- you expect me to...
- I'm not expecting.

711
00:40:57,147 --> 00:40:58,197
I'm hoping.

712
00:43:02,087 --> 00:43:03,986
Solved another case.

713
00:43:05,388 --> 00:43:06,705
Busted Wilson.

714
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:12,838
Looks like you're not
losing it after all.

715
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,257
