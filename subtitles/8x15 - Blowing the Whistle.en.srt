00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,840
It's just stupid.

180
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:03,811
A distal esophageal rupture
can lead to compartment syndrome

181
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:05,512
in his thigh--
explains both symptoms.

182
00:08:05,564 --> 00:08:07,565
No pain
when he swallows.

183

<i>(House)</i>
<i>What is honor?</i>

184
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,202

Getting straight As?

186
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:14,655
Killing your daughter
because she had the audacity

187
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,190
to get raped?

188
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,691
Ruptured triple-A.

189
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:19,243
Doesn't explain
the seizures.

190
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,028
Pancreatitis.

191
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,081
Gallstones obstructing
his pancreatic duct.

192
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,218
People define honor

193
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:31,338
as whatever makes them
feel honorable.

194
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,541
It's a circle going nowhere.

195
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:36,677
Which I guess
is what circles do.

196
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:38,545
We'll ultrasound his belly
and look for the obstruction.

197
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:45,936
I need your signature
on this order.

198
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:50,224
The Army's leaning
on Foreman to make sure

199
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,408
this is done
by the book.

200
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:53,894
Didn't need an order
for his last treatment.

201
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:55,362
This last treatment
wasn't a treatment.

202
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,681
- Forge it.
- I will.

203
00:08:57,749 --> 00:08:59,033
From now on.

204
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:03,404
But I need the original
so I know what to forge.

205
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:05,122
We were having coffee
when the dizziness started.

206
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:07,291
Business meeting?

207
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,292
Date.

208
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:09,593
Our first.

209
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,679
We met
at the 98 Cents store.

210
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,297
<i>We were reaching</i>
<i>for the same tube of cheese.</i>

Huh.

212
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,851
I'm sorry.

213
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:17,968
Yeah.

214
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:19,069
I need to talk to you.

215
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:22,806
Just about done.

216
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,477
Good news, based
on her thrifty shopping habits

217
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,562
and taste
for artificial dairy,

218
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:31,565
she's clearly
not a gold digger.

219
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:33,033
<i>Bad news:</i>

220
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:38,289
Based on his rhinotillexomania,

00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:40,374
Compulsive addiction
to nose-picking.

222
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,293
A small cut on the inside
of the left nostril

223
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:47,147
led to an infection
in the cavernous sinus.

224
00:09:47,215 --> 00:09:49,083
It was very nice
meeting you, Mel.

225
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:50,584
It's not true.

226
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:52,753
Gloria, wait,

227
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:55,756
I can change.

228
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:03,097
My PPTH contract.

229
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:05,799
House signed it
six months ago.

230
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,936
He signed this today.

231
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:14,942
His hands are unsteady.

232
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,911
Given his Vicodin abuse,

233
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:19,646
I think he has
hepatic encephalopathy.

234
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:20,864
[Laughs]

235
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:23,317
He's been forgetful,
inattentive.

236
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:25,869
Dominika's been trying out
new knish recipes.

237
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:27,421
One of them
didn't agree with him.

238
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:28,822
A little sleep deprivation
could account

239
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:31,091
for his forgetfulness
and inattention.

240
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,544
He loads up on caffeine.
That explains a jittery hand.

241
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:34,929
Maybe.

242
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:37,932
But if I'm right,
his liver's in decline.

243
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,517
It's curable, but
if he doesn't get treatment,

244
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:44,438
it could actually be fatal.

245
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:46,173
This happens
all the time.

246
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:48,442
One of the symptoms
of working for House--

247
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,811
you start seeing zebras
everywhere.

248
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:53,647
There's nothing wrong
with him.

249
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,910
House.

250
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:10,414
Shh.
I'm with a patient.

251
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:16,537
Sleep study.

252
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:26,714
You drugged him?

253
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,349
I didn't say
the study was voluntary.

254
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:36,407
I think you're sick.

255
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:40,411
What, 'cause I'm sleeping
in the clinic like I always do?

256
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,948
Slow reaction time.

257
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,583
Because I just woke up
from sleeping in the clinic

258
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:48,452
like I always do.

259
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:49,837
You're forgetful.

260
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:51,372
Sorry.
What did you say?

261
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,007
You forgot that we were
supposed to have lunch.

262
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:54,041
I didn't forget.

263
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:56,427
I was sleeping
in the clinic--

264
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:57,845
I'd like to run
some tests.

265
00:11:57,912 --> 00:11:59,747
For what?

266
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,215
Where's this coming from?

267
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:03,117
Hepatic encephalopathy.

268
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:05,886
I've watched you destroy your
body with Vicodin for years.

269
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:08,588
I'm surprised your liver's
lasted this long.

270
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,774
I'll do the examination
myself.

271
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:14,812
While having you juggle
my jewels sounds interesting,

272
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:17,564
there's no such thing
as friends with benefits.

273
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:21,485
It always gets weird.

274
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:31,578
Your friends out there
are getting a little handsy.

275
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,297
Get enough death threats,

276
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,966
eventually they start taking
them seriously.

277
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:39,053
A convoy was hit
outside of Kunar Province.

278
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,688
<i>Eight American soldiers</i>
<i>were killed.</i>

279
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:44,391
Army spokesperson's claiming
that it's revenge

280
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,060
for the attack
that I made public.

281
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:47,761
<i>Better me take the blame</i>
<i>than them.</i>

282
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,763
You don't think
you're to blame at all?

283
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:52,633
And you do.

284
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,018
<i>Like everyone else.</i>

285
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:57,404
A strike like that would take
more than three days to plan.

286
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:59,473
So the next one might be
your fault?

287
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:04,578
Lateral view looks good.

288
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:06,980
If you have such
a negative opinion of the army,

289
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:08,365
why did you enlist?

290
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,001
I needed to find out
what really happened to my dad.

291
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:14,188
There were two redacted pages
in his service record.

292
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:16,123
<i>Going into intelligence</i>
<i>was the quickest way</i>

293

<i>to up my security clearance.</i>

294
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:20,494
Then why would you leak
that video?

295
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:24,098
Part of my job was to grab
a cup of tea with the locals.

296
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,850

to make them more likely

298

00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,716
<i>we would have seen</i>
<i>cerebral masses on his head CT.</i>

357
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:41,819
- Yes!
- Taub, pitch again.

358
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:45,222
Now.

359
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:48,325
The nodules in his spleen
were granulomas.

360
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:51,561
He's got sarcoidosis!

361
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:53,514
Someone tell him
he's wrong.

362
00:15:53,581 --> 00:15:55,199
Sorry, House.

363
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,834
Sarcoid does explain
the seizures.

364
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:58,202
And the bruises.

365
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,871
Say bye-bye, House.

366
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:02,673
Yes!
[Grunts]

367
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,541
Yes!

368
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:10,747
Sarcoidosis it is.

369
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,966
Treat with steroids.

370
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:15,269
<i>Then come right back here,</i>

371
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:17,387
<i>'cause I'm not gonna rest</i>
<i>until I've made orphans</i>

372
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:18,972
of all your virtual children.

373
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:23,443
House never loses.

374
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,895
Seriously?

375
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:27,314
Me beating House
is medically significant?

376
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,066
It could be.

377
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:30,901
Reduced fine motor control.

378
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:33,654
Add that to inattention
and liver flap.

379
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,907
It does make sense.

380
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,075
We have to talk
to Foreman.

381
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,377
No, we don't.

382
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:41,879
First of all,

383
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,780
because I can beat him
in that game.

384
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:46,633
And, second,
even if you are right,

385
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:47,951
there's no reason to believe

386
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,003
that House's medical judgment
is impaired.

387
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:51,388
So we should wait
until he kills someone

388
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,756
for confirmation?

389
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:53,891
You really think
it's a coincidence

390
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,225
that we're treating
a whistleblower

391
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:58,128
and now talking about blowing
the whistle on House?

392
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,680
You're right.

393
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,932
Playing dumb,
messy signature,

394
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:03,650
losing a video game--

395
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:06,186
it's way too complicated
to fake.

396
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,160
No.
I won't take it.

397
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:16,997
Without this injection,

398
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:18,481
you could have
a fatal arrhythmia.

399
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:20,450
Tell Major Mathewson

400
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:22,536
that I'm not taking
any more treatment

401
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,922
until they give me
a live television interview.

402
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:27,791
You can't really think
they'll agree to that.

403
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:29,293
People need to know the tape's
not the reason

404
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:30,761
for that attack.

405
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,429
They need to know
why I did this.

406
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:33,997
<i>The people who think</i>
<i>you're a traitor</i>

407
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:35,883
will still think
you're a traitor,

408
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,634
and the people who think
you're a hero

409
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:38,936
will still think
you're a hero.

410
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:41,388
The truth makes a difference.

411
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:45,192
If Dad were here, he'd be
begging for you not to do this.

412
00:17:45,276 --> 00:17:49,212
If Dad were here,
he'd be proud of me.

413
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,411
The conspiracy theorists
are gonna go nuts

414
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:06,046
if the patient dies.

415
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,331
I told him that,
and he told me

416
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:08,882
that option
is still less damaging

417
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,634
than giving the kid
a national platform.

418
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:11,718
So what do we do now?

419
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:13,337
You explain
to your brother

420
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:15,055
that he overplayed
his hand.

421
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:16,256
That won't make
any difference.

422
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:17,975
The idiot thinks
he's doing the right thing.

423
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:20,394
What if we convinced a court
that his refusal

424
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:22,813
is part of an underlying
psychiatric disorder?

425
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,582
<i>They assign a conservator.</i>
<i>We do what we want.</i>

426
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,601
Fraud.
Great.

427
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:29,786
Narcissistic personality
disorder.

428
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:32,055
<i>Both the leaking of the tape</i>
<i>and the refusal of treatment</i>

429
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:33,907
indicate that he has no fear
of consequences.

430
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:35,092
<i>(Foreman) So instead of defrauding</i>
<i>the court,</i>

431
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,493
<i>you'll waste their time?</i>

432
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:38,745
No way a judge classifies
a personality disorder

433
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,997
as a mental illness.

434
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:42,115
If a decorated military officer,
who happened

435
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:45,102
to be the patient's brother,
corroborates, they might.

436
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:48,338
So you want me to sign
a piece of paper

437
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:49,756
that says my brother is crazy

438
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:51,675
for doing
what he thinks is right?

439
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:53,310
I want you to save his life.

440
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:54,928
His heart could go
at any time.

441
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,419
He's a fool.

442
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:03,603
But he's not crazy.

443
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,259
The patient
was refusing treatment

444
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,444
because of honor,
and his brother

445
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,946
is refusing
to be his conservator

446
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:14,197
because of honor.
Oh, good.

447
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:15,866
Taub's cured the patient.

448
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:17,317
I had to go
to the bathroom.

449
00:19:17,402 --> 00:19:19,369
Bathroom's that way.
You just ran in from that way.

450
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:20,737
That one's been out of order
for two days.

451
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:23,573
I had to go up
to the third floor.

452
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,710
I'm not lying.

453
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:28,578
It's out of order.

454
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:30,580
I believe you.
I'm gonna fix it.

455
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:32,449
We could treat if he doesn't
know he's being treated.

456
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,167
Lace his sponge bath.

457
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:36,503
It would take too long
to reach his bloodstream.

458
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:38,755
What if we aerosolize steroids
and blast the room?

459
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:40,007
Speaking of which...

460
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:47,481
It'd be too hard to get the
prednisone concentrations right.

461
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:49,266
No one fixes anything

462
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,634
unless they have
a compelling reason.

463
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:55,439
If we're gonna treat,

464
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,409
<i>we have to give him</i>
<i>a compelling reason,</i>

465
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:04,647
<i>something that he wants more</i>
<i>than an interview.</i>

466
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:07,217
<i>Fire in the hole!</i>

467
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:09,486
<i>(Chase) A signed order</i>
<i>from Major Mathewson.</i>

468
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:12,089
They've agreed to declassify
the redacted pages

469
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:13,673
from your father's
service record.

470
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:15,825
In two days,
you'll have all your answers.

471
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:17,961
But the only way you'll live
long enough to get the truth

472
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:19,379
is by accepting treatment.

473
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,501
I don't trust the Army
to follow through on this.

474
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:26,970
But you trust me.

475
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,407
I'll make sure
those pages get here.

476
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:38,681
Okay.

477
00:20:41,702 --> 00:20:44,154
Selfishness
is apparently honorable now.

478
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,022
He wanted to create change.

479
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:48,291
Instead, he's just satisfying
his own curiosity.

480
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,243
He's getting the truth.
Most he could hope for.

481
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:52,362
I need to take a dump.

482
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:55,165
Specifically,
House's dump.

483
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:07,344
You set this up?

484
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:08,929
All it took was showing up
two minutes late

485
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:11,047
and a $2 sign.

486
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:21,591
Bile deposits are irregular.

487
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:23,093
House's liver is failing.

488
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:35,922
Cognitive impairment
will get progressively worse.

489
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:41,344

My foot.

493
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:51,805

Cholesterol embolization.

497
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,158
Are you gonna even acknowledge
what we just told you?

498
00:22:07,763 --> 00:22:10,498
That you pilfered
my poo-poo?

499
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:12,967
Yeah, I was thinking
it would be less awkward

500
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:14,302
for all of us
if we could just pretend

501
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:15,687
that never happened.

on treatment now,

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,127
get you off Vicodin--

507
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:24,546
What's the opposite
of "thank you"?

508
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:26,931
I'm pretty sure
it ends in "you".

<i>I know my body.</i>
<i>I'm fine.</i>

Army tests

If you're not sick,

513
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,362
then our test,
accurate 99.5% of the time,

514
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:43,114
yielded a false positive
three separate times.

515

The odds of that
are 1 in 8 million.

516
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:47,452
The test is accurate.
The diagnosis isn't.

517
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:50,922
Sample was obviously
contaminated with other foods

interacting
with my liver enzymes.

519
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:54,209
Now could we talk
about the sick patient?

520
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:55,827
His clot dissolved.

<i>and you have to</i>
<i>do something about it.</i>

525
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:07,972
If we had a patient file
with the same symptoms

526
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:09,157
you're exhibiting...

527
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:10,725
And the symptoms
I'm not exhibiting?

528
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,862
Jaundice, ascites,
fetor hepaticus.

529
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:15,730
We can't tell
if your breath stinks

00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,585
<i>You'd still diagnose</i>
<i>hepatic encephalopathy.</i>

532
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:22,353
I know that because
four doctors you trained

533
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:25,356
have unanimously diagnosed you
with hepatic encephalopathy.

534
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:31,463
Park's right.

535
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,548
Treat the patient
with Heparin.

536
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:46,761
We'll have
a stronger argument

537
00:23:46,846 --> 00:23:48,880
if we go to Foreman
as a united front.

538
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:51,766
We'll have a stronger argument
if we have an argument.

539
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:54,519
If House is sick, it's
his business, not Foreman's.

540
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,738
Foreman's business is to make
sure his doctors are able

541
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:59,107
to do their jobs,
that lives aren't put at risk.

542
00:23:59,191 --> 00:24:01,025
Telling Foreman
will put lives at risk.

543
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:03,828
We tell Foreman,
House either agrees to treatment

544
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:06,781
or get suspended, which means
House gets suspended.

545
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:08,733
And considering House
at 90%

546
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:11,753
is better than any other doctor
at this hospital at 100%,

547
00:24:11,837 --> 00:24:14,372
that means our patients
get a lower standard of care.

548
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:16,541
House could be at 90%,
he could be at 60%,

549
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:17,909
we don't know.

550
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,210
And until we do,
there's no reason

551
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:21,179

Then what are you
doing here?

608
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:09,914
You know, my father taught me
that it's dishonorable

609

to interrupt someone
when they're reading.

610
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:14,719
Honor's not a punch line.

611
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,638
Get out of my room.

612
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:18,456

of your life in Leavenworth.

614
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:29,567
Worst case, you spend the rest
of your life here.

615
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:34,289
Justice for 34 deaths outweighs
anything the Army can do to me.

616
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:35,340
<i>They got justice?</i>

617
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:36,941
Do they know that?

618
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:40,128
What if only ten people
had died?

619
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:41,496
Four?

620
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,381
Even one civilian death...

621
00:27:43,448 --> 00:27:44,632
What if they just maimed
a few guys?

622
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:47,385
Would that have been
worth it?

623
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:49,821
My job was to log that tape,

624
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:54,692
get all the details
in the official record.

625
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,894
After the tenth time
of watching it,

626
00:27:56,962 --> 00:27:59,630
I stopped trying
to convince myself

627
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:02,300
that the shovel could have been
mistaken for a gun.

628
00:28:02,368 --> 00:28:05,403
'Cause all I could see
were the victims' faces.

629
00:28:05,471 --> 00:28:09,340
All I was doing was trying
to read that kid's lips

630
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:12,744
to make out his last words.

631
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:14,846
I couldn't sleep.

632
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:18,182
Couldn't eat.

633
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,952
Think I like the cue ball look?

634
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:24,355
My hair turned gray
in three days.

635
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:27,842
My body was telling me
I had to do whatever I could

636
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:30,011
to make sure
that something like this

637
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:32,430
never happened again.

638
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:40,337
Your hair turned gray
in three days.

639
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:43,558
Loss of hair color indicates
an autoimmune condition,

640
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:45,443
likely Grave's disease.

641
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:50,514
Hyperthyroidism leads
to a hypercoagulable state,

642
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:52,233
which causes thrombosis.

643
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:54,118
Start him
on antithyroids.

644
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:55,820
You want to reject
our current diagnosis

645
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:58,539
because he had
a few gray hairs,

646
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:00,458
panicked,
and shaved his head?

647
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:02,744
I want to reject
our current diagnosis

648
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,662
because I think
we're wrong.

649
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:06,831
And treating
for wrong diagnoses

650
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:08,833
can result in side effects
like death.

651
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:10,668
Even if he did full go gray,

652
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:13,370
stress seems way more likely
than Grave's.

653
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:14,705
I haven't read
any journal articles

654
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:15,923
proving that veterans have
a higher incidence

655
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:17,175
of depigmentation.

656
00:29:17,226 --> 00:29:18,393
Of course, that could be

657
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:20,377
the hepatic encephalopathy
talking.

658
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:21,729
Our treatment for Bernard
Soulier hasn't had time--

659
00:29:21,814 --> 00:29:23,981
so you all just want
to ignore the new symptom?

660
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:26,601
It's not grave's because
it's not a symptom at all.

661
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:29,604
And the antithyroids you want
could reduce his blood pressure

662
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:31,155
and his ability
to breathe.

663
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:33,574
Which can result
in side effects, like death.

664
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,109
Small soda.

665
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:37,728
Grave's it is.

666
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,163
Start him
on antithyroids.

667
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:46,204
I know we disagree
with House all the time,

668
00:29:46,255 --> 00:29:49,924
but, before I could say,
"okay, he's a genius."

669
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:55,680
Now...maybe
he's just really smart.

670
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:58,382
We're not gonna give him
the antithyroids.

671
00:30:12,364 --> 00:30:13,531
Everything okay?

672
00:30:13,598 --> 00:30:15,399
Any better?

673
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:16,651
Pretty good.

674
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:19,036
He did just ask me
for a blanket.

675
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:20,505
You're cold?

676
00:30:20,572 --> 00:30:22,606
A little.

677
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:24,041

00:30:32,217 --> 00:30:35,887

683
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:42,693
Bold move.

684
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:44,842
You've gone from
speculating I'm sick,

685
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,582
to acting like I'm dead.

686
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:48,823
We acted like
we don't trust your judgement,

687
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,830
because we don't
trust your judgement.

688
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:53,188
Why don't you start
by not trusting your own.

689
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:56,085
We did more blood work,
it's not Graves either.

690
00:30:58,352 --> 00:30:59,552
Talk to you for a minute?

691
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:03,561
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say to them.

692
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:05,877
It's only fair. Cause
anything they say to me,

693
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:07,102
they also say to you.

694
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:11,246
Jiggle your pockets.
Whose got the silver coin?

695
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,594
Until you receive
a clean bill of health,

696
00:31:14,761 --> 00:31:16,728
I'll be authorizing
all treatment orders.

697
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:25,687
Well, I would say that that was
an incredibly stupid mistake,

698
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:27,472
but apparently I'd have
to clear that opinion

699
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:28,607
through Foreman first.

700
00:31:28,658 --> 00:31:31,160
White count is high.

701
00:31:31,244 --> 00:31:32,578
So all the infections
we ruled out

702
00:31:32,645 --> 00:31:34,580
when he came in
are back on the table.

703
00:31:34,647 --> 00:31:35,681
Legionnaire's.

704
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:36,849
Unlikely without pneumonia.

705
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,517
<i>(House)</i>
<i>Taub.</i>

706
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:41,319
Loyalty issues
in his personal life.

707
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:43,956
Makes sense that they'd cross
over into his professional one.

708
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:46,008
I was hoping we can get
a diagnosis

709
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:47,159
before the witch hunt.

710
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:49,127
The patient's infection

711
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:50,846
is an inherently
less interesting puzzle

712
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,931
than the stab wound
to my back.

713
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,017
Fine.
I told Foreman.

714
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:56,552
Can we move on now?

715
00:31:56,636 --> 00:31:57,669
What about dengue?

716
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,438
Patient
isn't in enough pain.

717
00:31:59,506 --> 00:32:00,839
<i>No.</i>

718
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,875
I don't mean about dengue.
I have no idea.

719
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:04,643
<i>Taub's only confessing</i>
<i>because he wants us</i>

720
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:06,195
to focus on the patient.

721
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,846
I told Foreman.

722
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:09,147
I did.

723
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:12,618
The next person
to confess is fired.

724
00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:13,852
Or Spartacus.

725
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:15,871
For clarification,
no one's getting fired.

726
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:17,623
Who else has a pitch?

727
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,025
And then...there's Park.

728
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:22,861
The only one
who didn't confess.

729
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:26,031
The same cowardice
that makes someone unable

730
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:27,666
to move out
of mommy and daddy's home

731
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:29,835
might also make someone
a tattletale.

732
00:32:29,886 --> 00:32:31,553
You threatened to fire
the next person who--

733
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:32,988
And it's malaria.

734
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:34,973
No, it's not.

735
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,775
The Army issues
anti-malaria medication.

736
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,227
And has done
for ten years.

737
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:40,979
That's the equivalent
of 5,000 generations

738
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:42,514
<i>of the Afghan mosquito,</i>
anopheles gambiae.

739
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:45,100
That's plenty long enough
to develop a resistance.

740
00:32:45,184 --> 00:32:49,104
<i>Anopheles,</i> by the way,
is Greek for "useless."

741
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:52,741
Cover for intra-abdominal sepsis

742
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:57,613
<i>And was I also right</i>

743
00:32:57,697 --> 00:32:59,531
that it was a stupid idea?

744
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:02,334
We believe you have malaria.

745
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:04,069
These pills--

746
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,040
I don't want
any medication.

747
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:11,076
My dad's file
should have been here.

748
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:13,045
Brant, I told you,
I looked into it.

749
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:16,348
There's just a delay.

750
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:19,768
I believe
that's what the Army's saying.

751
00:33:19,852 --> 00:33:23,188
I don't believe it's true.

752
00:33:23,255 --> 00:33:27,759
If they're not going to keep
their end of the bargain,

753
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,263
neither am I.

754
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,401
So we got groped
for nothing.

755
00:33:36,452 --> 00:33:37,936
If he doesn't want
to stay alive--

756
00:33:37,987 --> 00:33:41,373
Hold on.

757
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,742
Is it too late
to become his conservator?

758
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:47,612
I know what I said before.

759
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:50,315
Right now I don't care.

760
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:52,384
Of course not.

761
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:54,803
We'll get the paperwork
drawn up.

762
00:34:09,802 --> 00:34:11,570
He changed his mind?

763
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,339
Why?

764
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:15,490
His brother's dying.

765
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:17,275
He needs
a more substantial reason?

766
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:18,610
His brother was dying
the last time

767
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:20,345
we asked him
to be the conservator.

768
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:22,647
So instead of pushing the issue
with the Army

769
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:26,818
to get the file, he just decided
to give up on his code?

770
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:31,757
Apparently.

771
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,132
So where do I sign?

772
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:42,517
We don't need you to.

773
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:45,187
The Army gave the file
to you yesterday.

774
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:48,857
Major Mathewson had
another copy sent over to us.

775
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:56,982
You know, there's a reason I
didn't want that file released.

776
00:34:57,033 --> 00:35:00,652
I know.
I read it.

777
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,704
I'm gonna treat
my patient now.

778
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:09,378
<i>[Door slides]</i>

779
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:15,133
I was right.

780
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:17,335
Wasn't I?

781
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:32,601
How did he die?

782
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:35,020
What did they cover up?

783
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,027
They didn't cover up
anything.

784
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:44,196
I did.

785
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,536
Dad died in that car accident
because he was drunk.

786
00:35:51,587 --> 00:35:53,705
Killed a pedestrian too.

787
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:56,291
What are you--
what--

788
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,760
He drank, Brant, a lot.

789
00:35:58,845 --> 00:36:02,597
You were too young
to see it.

790
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:08,920
I, uh, I had
some of dad's buddies...

791
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:11,606
take care of his files.

792
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:22,367
It was the only time
I ever broke the rules.

793
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:25,737
I'm sorry.

794
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:35,330
Can I begin treatment?

795
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,659
(Taub)
Fever hasn't broken.

796
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:46,843
White count is still up.

797
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:49,313
Renal function
is declining.

798
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:50,731
<i>(Foreman) So he has all the signs</i>
<i>of malaria,</i>

799
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:52,783
<i>except the antimalarials</i>
<i>aren't curing him.</i>

800
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,351
Gonorrhea?

801
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:55,852
If it got into his heart...

802
00:36:55,904 --> 00:36:57,538
We did an echo.
His valves look good.

803
00:36:57,622 --> 00:36:58,989
What about--

804
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:02,493
you bastard.

805
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:05,579
You were faking.

806
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:11,418
Yesterday, House stole candy
by putting it into a cup.

807
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:13,354
The cup was too small,
so his solution

808
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:14,938
was to remove
some of the candy.

809
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:17,591
But the obviously logical thing
was to just get a bigger cup,

810
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:20,644
which he did today,
because he's no longer faking.

811
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:22,379
He couldn't have faked it.
We tested your--

812
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,348
I took St. John's Wort
to alter the way

813
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,417
my liver metabolized
acetaminophen.

814
00:37:26,484 --> 00:37:30,521
Then some n-acetylcysteine
just to finish it off.

815
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:32,439
You tortured them
to torture me

816
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:34,291
just to see
who you could trust?

817
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:37,911
I did it to save lives.

818
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:40,447
God, I wish I could rationalize
that one.

819
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:42,399
And now you're going
to brilliantly deduce

820
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,734
which one of us
is the rat?

821
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:45,702
What makes you think
I haven't already?

822
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:56,746
To be continued.

823
00:37:56,798 --> 00:37:59,600
I need to brilliantly cure
a patient.

824
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,190
No hair usually means
no lice.

825
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:09,560
What we didn't account for
was that it wasn't your hair.

826
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:12,896
Tea was not the only thing
that your Afghani neighbors

827
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:14,364
shared with you.

828
00:38:14,432 --> 00:38:15,699
I'm sure
they were generous enough

829
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:16,984
to let you sit
on their furniture,

830
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:20,204
which was infested
with rat lice.

831
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:22,272
You have typhus.

832
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,941
Caused the vasculitis
and explains

833
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:25,075
all your other symptoms.

834
00:38:25,126 --> 00:38:28,078
But here's
where it gets interesting.

835
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:31,215
One of those symptoms,
a lawyer might argue,

836
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:33,083
was leaking the tape.

837
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:36,253
There are psychiatric issues
associated with typhus.

838
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:37,855
<i>If you change your mind,</i>

839
00:38:37,922 --> 00:38:39,223

you've got a case.

841
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:47,331
I'd be undermining everything
I've been trying to do.

842
00:38:47,398 --> 00:38:52,920
You did what you thought
you had to do.

843
00:38:52,987 --> 00:38:57,274
Going to jail proves nothing.

844
00:38:57,342 --> 00:38:59,109
It proves
I still have my honor.

845
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:07,117
You're not doing this
for honor.

846
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:10,420
You're doing this
to please your father.

847
00:39:10,488 --> 00:39:11,722
And the pathetic thing
is that the man

848
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:14,491
you're trying to please
never existed.

849
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:34,061
Traitor.

850
00:39:36,481 --> 00:39:39,015
You've been avoiding me
for two days.

851
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:41,017
'Cause, when I stranded you
behind the barricades,

852
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:42,252
you went straight
to Foreman.

853
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,737
I've been avoiding you

854
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:46,323
because you're an ass.

855
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:48,509
I've been an ass my whole life.
I can't get rid of you.

856
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:49,543
You can get rid of me now.

857
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:53,247
Just turn and limp away.

858
00:39:53,331 --> 00:39:55,916
Huh.

859
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,920
Your whiny righteousness
has the stench of sincerity.

860
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:02,639
Fine. I have to punish
my whole team

861
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:04,374
so that one of them
will step forward.

862
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:08,878
Makes sense.

863
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,731
Damn.

864
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:12,149
Now I'm gonna have to punish
my whole team

865
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:13,684
so that one of them
will step forward.

866
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:15,102
You just said that.

867
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:18,405
Yeah, but I meant it
this time.

868
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:20,908
First time
I was just testing you.

869
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,993

genuinely confess

870

There's no rational reason
for you to have done it.

882
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,110
And my punishment
will be nothing.

883
00:41:47,178 --> 00:41:49,112
You wanted me
to tell Foreman.

884
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,947
Your ability
to solve puzzles

885
00:41:51,015 --> 00:41:52,616
is the only thing
that matters to you.

886
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:54,001
And you're smart enough
to know

887
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:57,037
even you'll lose your edge
at some point.

888
00:41:57,121 --> 00:42:00,007
You want to make sure
someone's there when you do.

889
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:04,928
If that were true,

890
00:42:04,995 --> 00:42:09,666
why are li'l Chase's
li'l cousins

891
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:12,436
scurrying through
your apartment's floorboards

892
00:42:12,503 --> 00:42:14,521
right now?
