1
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:26,012
Yeah.

2
00:00:46,753 --> 00:00:48,093
Come back to bed.

3
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:50,176
Gimme a minute.

4
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:52,681
You get 20 seconds.

5
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,649
Hey, what are you...

6
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:27,219
Female, late 20s,
tonic clonic seizure.

7
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:29,509
- Duration of the seizure?
- A little over three minutes.

8
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:31,511
Does your friend
have a history of epilepsy?

9
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:32,838
She never said.

10
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,578
I'm Dr. Cameron.
You're in a hospital.

11
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:36,556
We're gonna take care of you.
What's her name?

12
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:37,600
I don't know.

13
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:43,231
House - Season 05 Episode 05
"Lucky Thirteen"

14
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:50,177
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak

15
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:08,589
www.house-fr.com

16
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:11,097
House.

17
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:16,163
I have a case
I think you might be interested in.

18
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,507
Not now.

19
00:02:20,422 --> 00:02:23,021
A 26-year-old woman
had a tonic clonic seizure.

20
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:26,277
What about me speeding away
says to you "let's chat"?

21
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:29,277
History of fatigue, and two years ago
she had a retinal vein occlusion.

22
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,715
She's diabetic.

23
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:31,956
No, she's not.

24
00:02:32,076 --> 00:02:34,127
And she has no history
of hypertension.

25
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,656
It can wait.

26
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:41,717
I knew I should've set up
a video camera. Stay there.

27
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:47,263
Oh, my goodness.

28
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:51,210
I played a practical joke on
my best friend, and he's badly injured.

29
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:54,793
I wish I had learned
this valuable lesson earlier.

30
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:58,056
I was waiting
by my window for an hour.

31
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,715
- Why are you late?
- I had a breakfast meeting

32
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:03,903
at mickey's diner
with the mercy people to tell them...

33
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,704
I'm come back to work here.

34
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:14,113
Sorry if it interfered
with your plan to maim me.

35
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:17,080
Donut's a nice touch.

36
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,503
It's just a way of saying
"welcome back."

37
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,603
The seizure could be the result of
dehydration or something neurological.

38
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:36,152
Or the ecstasy
you found in her system.

39
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,261
According to Dr. Hadley,
the patient took the drugs

40
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,370
about five hours
before the seizure, so.

41
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,096
What does thirteen know about it?

42
00:03:42,216 --> 00:03:44,143
Apparently she was
with the patient last night.

43
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:47,105
At 3:00 a.m.?

44
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:51,299
Oh, yeah.

45
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,370
Penthouse forum
meets medical mystery.

46
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,351
Maybe there is a god.

47
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,385
Empty transient sex?

48
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:03,564
I've been waiting for you
to spiral out of control

49
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:05,861
ever since you got
your huntington's diagnosis,

50
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:07,689
but this is more
than I dared hope for.

51
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:09,637
Patient's seizure
resulted from dehydration,

52
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:11,898
which resulted from
a cocktail of alcohol and ecstasy.

53
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,584
- Mystery solved.
- Wait.

54
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:16,438
- Were you doing drugs?
- Not diagnostically relevant.

55
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:18,293
Depends what
we're trying to diagnose.

56
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:20,305
It's how steep
of a spiral you're on.

57
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:22,588
Our patient hemorrhaged
into her eye two years ago.

58
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,074
Not diagnostically relevant.
Retinal vein occlusion was fixed.

59
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:26,885
Her doctor said
it was a venous anomaly.

60
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,165
Is he in this room?

61
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:30,148
If he's not,
i don't care what he thinks.

62
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:32,307
Unless he's a she and she
was there last night too,

63
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:33,976
in which case I care very deeply.

64
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:36,371
If the eye problem wasn't with
her vein, but with her blood?

65
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,364
Would explain why she seized,
why she's tired.

66
00:04:38,484 --> 00:04:40,408
She parties 3:00 a.m.
That's why she's tired.

67
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:41,710
Yet you seem fine.

68
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,084
She's visited four other doctors
in the past year.

69
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:47,081
None of them found anything. She's a
hypochondriac who drank too much.

70
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:49,379
- Blood clots could explain everything.
- Makes sense.

71
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,003
Bone marrow's in overdrive.
Too many platelets.

72
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:53,171
Sorry.

73
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:57,077
Thirteen, go stick a needle
in your girlfriend's pelvis.

74
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,219
And no, that one wasn't a metaphor.

75
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,930
Suck out some marrow.

76
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:03,556
That one was.

77
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:10,969
I like to watch.

78
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:16,945
I can handle this alone.

79
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,656
You've already handled it.
That's why you need a chaperone.

80
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:23,671
Of course, i'm a very permissive,
understanding chaperone.

81
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:25,756
So feel free to ignore me.

82
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:29,194
You know, if you're in the mood to start
kissing, or groping, or showering.

83
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:32,543
You'll have to excuse dr. House.
He mistakes immaturity for edginess.

84
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,796
You're Dr. House?

85
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,509
I assume my name came up
last night in the form of a moan.

86
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,303
You had sex, then a seizure.

87
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:45,766
Could be a particular position
or activity that set it off.

88
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:49,435
That sounds like a valid
medical theory, doesn't it?

89
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:51,263
I'm really sorry. Just ignore him.

90
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:53,523
Whatever you think we did, we did.

91
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:55,924
- And then some.
- Lights on or off?

92
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:57,986
Do you have a medical
rationalization for that?

93
00:05:58,146 --> 00:05:59,988
- Light sensitivity.
- On.

94
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:05,319
Figured she had more
shame than that. Did she talk dirty, or

95
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:07,570
did you rely on vague hand signals?

96
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,665
She's pretty direct
about what she wants.

97
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:12,709
I'm learning so much.

98
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:16,004
Okay, score the score.

99
00:06:16,164 --> 00:06:17,361
Scale of one to ten.

100
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,824
Don't answer.

101
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:20,550
Seven.

102
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:23,546
Finally got one right.

103
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,101
You want to investigate him
because he ate a donut?

104
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,354
He claimed he had a morning
meeting at Mickey's diner.

105
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:33,828
Wilson loves Mickey's diner.

106
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:36,566
He has the french toast tower
whenever he sets foot in the door.

107
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:39,694
There's no way he would've come
to work wanting more carbs.

108
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:42,530
He lied to me.
I need to know why.

109
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:46,452
- What do you think you'll find out?
- I'm worried that he might be a spy.

110
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,162
He's been gone 4 months. You're worried
the friendship has changed.

111
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:52,582
I'm just not sure if he's working for
Hirohito or the new England patriots.

112
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:54,876
You played a practical joke on him.
He didn't laugh.

113
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:57,331
I need something
to lord over him, a lie...

114
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,760
He didn't try to retaliate.
He moralized.

115
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,090
He always moralized.

116
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:03,551
He always moralized and got even.
He hasn't fired back.

117
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:06,088
Things always change.

118
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:07,722
And that sucks.

119
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:10,258
Yeah.

120
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,689
Find out where he was.

121
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:17,958
Should've know
it wasn't a coincidence.

122
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,533
Found your letters.

123
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,236
You recognized House's name.

124
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:25,448
You're the first patient I've seen who
actually enjoyed being accosted by him.

125
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:28,576
- I would've told you, but...
- What exactly would you have told me?

126
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:30,480
That you slept with me
to get to House?

127
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,133
That you've been trying to get him
to take your case for over a year?

128
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,253
I'm sick.

129
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:36,084
No one even wrote back.

130
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:38,461
- You used me.
- You used me.

131
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:39,754
My motives were clear.

132
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:43,758
You might've figured out my motives
faster if you bothered to ask my name.

133
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:50,681
I followed you to that bar because
I wanted to talk to you.

134
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,434
See if you'd help me get to House.

135
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:55,443
I didn't expect you to be

136
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:57,754
so aggressive.

137
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,832
- Was that seizure even real?
- Why would I fake a symptom?

138
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:03,277
It would just make it harder
for House to diagnose me.

139
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,905
There's nothing to diagnose.
Your biopsy results are negative.

140
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,809
Then it's something else.

141
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,848
Get dressed.
I'm discharging you.

142
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:12,161
House admitted me.

143
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:13,734
He obviously thinks...

144
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:16,596
House is using you as an excuse
to stick his nose in my personal life.

145
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:18,292
I'm tired all the time.

146
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:23,548
Some nights I fall asleep at 10:00
and wake up at noon, still tired.

147
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:27,264
Every doctor I've seen
tells me there's nothing wrong.

148
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:30,847
And that proves what, exactly?
That they're wrong or that you're wrong?

149
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,351
Come on. You expect me to believe...

150
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:40,022
Sit back. Deep breaths.
Try and relax.

151
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,067
Get the paddles.
She's gonna crash.

152
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,320
Damn.

153
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:51,701
We had to use paddles
to stabilize the patient's heart.

154
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,919
Eye issue, brain issue,
now a heart issue.

155
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,329
Sounds like a real case to me.

156
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:59,500
I get it. I was wrong.
Can we move on?

157
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:02,463
You're just upset because
the whole time she was with you,

158
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,155
she was thinking of my huge,
throbbing...

159
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:07,925
Diagnostic skills.

160
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:11,525
- Drugs would explain everything.
- This morning, you rejected drugs.

161
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:14,807
That's when I thought that thirteen
was right and was jerking her around.

162
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:18,186
Cardiac arrest means
she could be a serious user.

163
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,106
- Great.
- What?

164
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,318
That means that something
she did at my place set this off.

165
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:26,862
Either she brought drugs in, or

166
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:28,856
she grabbed something
from my medicine cabinet.

167
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:30,873
That means my place
needs to be searched.

168
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,963
Now, I'd be happy to do that myself,

169
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,776
but unfortunately that would be far
less titillating for House,

170
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:38,160
so he's about to come up
with some convoluted medical reason

171
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,167
why I have to stay here
while he goes through my stuff.

172
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:45,097
Patient's dad had bypass surgery.

173
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,427
Means she's a candidate
for atherosclerosis.

174
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:48,883
She needs an ultrasound.

175
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:51,455
That was much less convoluted
than what you just said.

176
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:54,163
I'm not giving you my keys.
If you want to do this, i'm going.

177
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:55,690
Who could pick a lock?

178
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,780
I'll go.

179
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,792
Make sure
he doesn't steal any underwear.

180
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:06,108
You're a disgrace
to your stereotype.

181
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:07,429
Move over.

182
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,360
Think you can pick a lock
faster than me?

183
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,446
No need to pick.

184
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:13,434
Nice.

185
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:15,219
Steal from your employees.

186
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:16,205
Never.

187
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:20,286
I had my dick make keys when
I hired him to dick up the team.

188
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,797
Always imagined she'd have
a sex swing in the living room.

189
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,582
- Give me my key.
- Don't have your key.

190
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:33,724
You expect me to believe
that you hired lucas

191
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:35,657
to investigate everyone
except for me?

192
00:10:35,777 --> 00:10:38,224
Waste of money.
I already know everything about you.

193
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:41,652
Thirteen had her purse.
That's gotta be the patient's.

194
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:44,583
Check it for drugs.
I call shotgun on the bedroom.

195
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,567
You know that I stole a car
when I was a teenager.

196
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,599
You know that my mom
has alzheimer's.

197
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:54,365
- You know nothing else.
- Want me to have you investigated?

198
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,575
- When did you get so needy?
- Not needy.

199
00:10:56,737 --> 00:10:58,130
Just don't buy it.

200
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,179
You always want
more information about people.

201
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:03,457
Look where we are.

202
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,418
Purse is clean.

203
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,346
Last night wasn't the first time that
thirteen brought home some strange.

204
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,016
- If you found her diary...
- No toys.

205
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:22,256
You sleep with the same person
over and over,

206
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:25,563
that's when you need accessories.
First time is exciting on its own.

207
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:26,765
Unless...

208
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:34,322
You think an asthma inhaler
could be used as a sex toy?

209
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:38,826
There are ways of getting to know
people without committing felonies.

210
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:41,871
People interest me.
Conversations don't.

211
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,123
Because conversations go both ways.

212
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:47,510
Like thirteen.

213
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:52,378
Brown recluse.
Found it at your apartment.

214
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,033
Their venom can cause
seizures and heart problems.

215
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:59,214
Unless the ultrasound
showed anything...

216
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:00,056
No.

217
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:02,516
- What room did you find it in?
- Bathroom.

218
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,019
Nice bidet, by the way.
Very refreshing.

219
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,059
I don't have a bidet.

220
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:11,067
Spider's not the only
interesting thing I found.

221
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,242
Yeah, my inhaler is fascinating.

222
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:22,926
It's got its own extensive
online following.

223
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:25,581
- You have asthma?
- When I was a kid.

224
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:28,016
It started acting up again when
I moved into my new place.

225
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:29,617
- You moved?
- Who cares?

226
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:32,407
He doesn't.
He's just surprised he didn't know.

227
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:35,194
You withhold things other people
would never bother to.

228
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:36,967
The move, a little wheeze,

229
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,034
whatever you thought was
in my pocket instead of your inhaler.

230
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:42,098
Maybe I should make
a return trip to your place.

231
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:44,225
Spider bite
doesn't explain anything unless

232
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:46,645
the patient was actually
bitten by a spider.

233
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,698
- I'll do the exam.
- Don't be ridiculous.

234
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,506
That would be inappropriate.
It'd be better if a woman gropes her.

235
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,734
There's no sexual tension that way.

236
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:03,327
I need you to stand up
and take off your gown.

237
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,917
I think I would've felt
a spider biting me.

238
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,595
Not necessarily.

239
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:19,510
You really need those after
everything we did the other night?

240
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:22,024
The other night
I wasn't your doctor.

241
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,516
How long
are you gonna stay mad at me?

242
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,756
How long are you going to be here?

243
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:29,907
Okay, then.

244
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:34,472
Look...

245
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,489
I really had no intention
of ever seeing you again.

246
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,686
So...

247
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,327
Having me end up here
is a little less than ideal.

248
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:46,412
I get it.

249
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,344
But... we just met.

250
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:51,426
How'd you know
you didn't want to see me again?

251
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:54,630
It's nothing personal.

252
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:58,674
I'm just really not that
into repeat performances.

253
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,887
I figured
I wasn't the first girl you cruised.

254
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:05,550
Why is that?

255
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:08,973
You're awfully good at it.

256
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:13,541
You'd think with all that experience
that I'd be better than a seven.

257
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:15,873
We just met.

258
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:17,902
We were both drunk.

259
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:21,322
Not like there wasn't potential.

260
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,957
Little more practice
for the both of us,

261
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:29,607
I'd say we're looking at a nine.

262
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:31,393
Easy.

263
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,870
But that would require
a repeat performance.

264
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:42,566
You didn't have to move your hand.

265
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:46,006
I didn't.
My hand's on your hip.

266
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,681
You don't feel that?

267
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:51,362
What does that mean?

268
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,906
It means it's not a spider bite.

269
00:14:58,246 --> 00:15:00,071
Blood test confirms
low potassium levels.

270
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,149
Explains the numbness in her hip.

271
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,533
It's not good, but we've got time for
some comments about my personal life.

272
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:08,722
Which you just wasted
with that comment about my comments.

273
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:12,116
Low potassium means her heart problem
was a symptom of a kidney problem.

274
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:14,871
- What caused the kidney problem?
- Could be I.G.A. Nephropathy.

275
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:17,771
- Not without blood in the urine.
- P.S.A.G.N. ?

276
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:20,965
- Not with normal blood pressure.
- Renal tubular acidosis.

277
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:23,342
Her kidney's don't filter acid
out of the blood.

278
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:26,666
Excess acid drives down potassium,
causes kidney calcifications.

279
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:31,308
If it's RTA, all she needs is sodium
bicarbonate for the acid

280
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:33,958
and surgery to remove
the calcifications.

281
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,198
Ct her kidneys. If you find
calcifications, we have our diagnosis.

282
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:45,239
What's he doing now?

283
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:48,701
He's playing
that carjacking video game.

284
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,829
He'd get a lot farther
if he didn't stop at all the red lights.

285
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:55,210
Maybe he was doing something
he thinks I'll mock him for.

286
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:56,430
Like...

287
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:00,380
- Just about anything.
- You don't think it's that.

288
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,547
I don't think
it's just about anything?

289
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:04,965
You don't think
it's about anything trivial.

290
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:07,037
If you weren't worried,
you wouldn't be here.

291
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,952
Maybe he's seeing a shrink.

292
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,837
That does not look
like a pizza delivery.

293
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:16,186
Doesn't matter if it isn't.
Wilson doesn't buy his pizza.

294
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,403
There's eight units
in this building.

295
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:23,235
There's got to be a pervert like me
living in at least one of them.

296
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:27,310
Because you represent one out of every
eight people living in this country.

297
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:34,037
Apparently, he has developed
a taste for pizza.

298
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,494
Things change.

299
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:49,057
CT shows one more calcification near
the superior pyramid on the left kidney.

300
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:50,512
See it.

301
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,570
That thing you were hoping
House didn't find at your place.

302
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:04,402
I... I found it.

303
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:09,771
He did the cag test two weeks ago.

304
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,325
A number this high means you have
less time than you thought.

305
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,954
It's understandable you'd be upset. It
doesn't mean you have to self-destruct.

306
00:17:17,278 --> 00:17:19,937
It's not noble for you
to protect me from House

307
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:22,960
- if you're just gonna judge...
- There are things you should be doing.

308
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,704
Working out, improving balance
and coordination.

309
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,904
That sounds like a blast.

310
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:29,967
I'm having fun.

311
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:32,313
Cramming as much life
into my life as I can.

312
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:35,407
You're doing drugs. Staying up
all night, having sex with strangers.

313
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:37,099
It sounds fun to me.

314
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:39,520
Good night.

315
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:45,337
Close the incisions.

316
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,104
- She won't even have a scar.
- Her o2 stats are dropping.

317
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:51,907
- Did you nick something?
- Procedure was clean. Bp's strong.

318
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:54,363
Well, she's not breathing.
We need to intubate.

319
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,210
The breathing problem started
after we fixed her kidney problem.

320
00:18:03,564 --> 00:18:05,578
Means the RTA
isn't the underlying cause.

321
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:08,173
- Where's thirteen?
- Traffic's bad. She's probably just...

322
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:09,744
Not here.

323
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:11,677
It's not her lungs.

324
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,443
No masses, no infiltrates.

325
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:16,092
Lungs are working,
but she still can't breathe.

326
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:19,143
Distribution plant can't distribute
if it's not getting deliveries.

327
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:21,437
If lungs are fine,
maybe the supply line has a problem.

328
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:22,563
Airway collapse.

329
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:25,845
That could signal autoimmune or a kind
of dystrophy as the underlying cause.

330
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:28,190
There's only one way to find out
if her airway failed.

331
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,031
Make it happen again.

332
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:33,259
Stick thirteen's
carpet cleaner on a treadmill.

333
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,376
Methacholine challenge.
And someone find the carpet.

334
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:48,714
Exam going on 15 minutes.

335
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:55,305
Good morning, Dr. Hadley.

336
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:02,227
- Just spoke to my brother.
- And by brother, you mean?

337
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:04,496
I mean my parents' other son.

338
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:05,650
Same dad.

339
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,733
Got a call last week from your P.I.

340
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:10,235
You lied.
You did have me investigated.

341
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:14,198
You've taunted the team with what you've
learned, but you never came after me.

342
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:17,284
Means you couldn't find anything.

343
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:19,501
You're right.

344
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:29,811
That's because you haven't done anything
stupid, spontaneous,

345
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:32,633
or even vaguely interesting
since you were 17.

346
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:36,098
And that's just sad.

347
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,769
I found her in the clinic
giving herself iv fluids.

348
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,231
At least you could've let her finish.
She looks terrible.

349
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:49,525
She has a fresh nightclub stamp
on her wrist.

350
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:51,068
She's can't practice.

351
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:53,701
Unless this is a prelude
to an actual spanking,

352
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:56,406
- there's no reason for me to be...
- I want her to take a drug test.

353
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:59,952
- You can't make me do that.
- But I can suspend you until you do.

354
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,277
Because she went to a nightclub
in her free time?

355
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:04,122
Or because she had sex
in her free time?

356
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:07,247
Patient was undergoing
routine surgery for RTA.

357
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,461
Didn't need 13 here for that.
And I don't need you

358
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:12,129
making my employees
punch a clock or pee in a cup.

359
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:13,164
Let's go.

360
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:15,543
Come on.

361
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:20,991
Thank you.

362
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:23,942
By the way,

363
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,354
the surgery was not routine.

364
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:30,649
Patient stopped breathing
and you missed a differential.

365
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:31,967
You're fired.

366
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,073
What?

367
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:37,614
You just defended me.

368
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:40,409
No, I just prevented you
from getting a drug test.

369
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,452
Probably saved your career.

370
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,925
I'm already taking responsibility
for one doctor with a drug habit.

371
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,750
I don't have a drug habit.

372
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:51,920
The slutty party girl is fun
till she pukes on your shoes.

373
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:55,507
Then she's just a pain in the ass.

374
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:11,899
I haven't sat on this couch
for four months.

375
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:15,898
It remembers my cheeks.

376
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,159
- I Miss this.
- Me too.

377
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,035
Me trying to work.
You interrupting.

378
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:25,809
Oh, come on. Your patients
could wait five minutes.

379
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:27,122
Get me caught up.

380
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:29,249
Come on, what did you do?
Travel?

381
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:30,845
Did you get a new hobby?

382
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,544
Did you meet someone?

383
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:34,230
Actually, yes.

384
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:39,030
I sort of started dating someone.

385
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,929
Great.

386
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:44,389
What does she do?

387
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,468
Is she... an actress?

388
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:51,153
Why would you think that?

389
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:53,850
I just figured you'd
want something a little more...

390
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:55,946
- Exciting.
- She's not...

391
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:02,065
You're gonna find out anyway
because you're gonna meet her.

392
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:04,796
She's...

393
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:06,536
a prostitute.

394
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:09,700
Used to be.

395
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:13,102
She made some mistakes.

396
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:15,978
Single mom, had some drug issues.

397
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,634
But...
She's so smart.

398
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:24,285
She wants to go to law school.

399
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:28,663
And... I told her I'd help her
with tuition.

400
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:34,356
- How long have you known her?
- Oh, I knew you'd be like this.

401
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:36,338
I asked a question.

402
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:39,781
You are a drug addict.
You go to prostitutes.

403
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,196
You can't be judgmental.

404
00:22:41,358 --> 00:22:43,731
- And yet.
- Please, don't do this to me.

405
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:46,821
I was hurting,
and I wanted to feel good.

406
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:50,379
I didn't expect it to go this way.
I...

407
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,333
Amber...

408
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:57,713
Said that she wanted me to move on.

409
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,007
That she wanted me to...

410
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,308
Be happy. And...

411
00:23:03,922 --> 00:23:06,674
Debbie makes me happy.

412
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,558
If you're happy, I'm...

413
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:27,587
I heard.

414
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:31,080
I'm looking for my ticket back.

415
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,883
Sorry if I upset you.

416
00:23:33,235 --> 00:23:36,007
- I didn't want to invade your privacy.
- It wasn't your fault.

417
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:38,262
Can you get me caught up?

418
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,174
Think you're gonna find
something we didn't?

419
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,549
It's good for the patient.
Good for me.

420
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:45,203
Films are clean.
We ruled out hypertension.

421
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:48,847
Guys have her on a treadmill
running a methacholine challenge.

422
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:52,184
And I still think you've been
acting like an idiot.

423
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:54,185
I know.

424
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,511
Did you talk about whether
this lung field looks a little dark?

425
00:23:57,631 --> 00:24:00,583
- It's probably just over-exposed.
- Or her diaphragm's a little flat.

426
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:04,029
- Could be a sign of hyperinflation.
- Suggests a pulmonary obstruction.

427
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:05,259
Lung cysts.

428
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:07,724
They wouldn't show up on an x-ray.

429
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:11,473
Treadmill test isn't gonna close
her airway. Her lungs'll explode.

430
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:17,201
Her throat's fine.

431
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,377
We made her airway collapse,
but it's not collapsed.

432
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:22,339
You ruptured a cyst!
Her lung collapsed.

433
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,884
- Breath sounds on both sides.
- Move.

434
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:31,636
Trachea's deviating to the left.

435
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:41,817
Nice.

436
00:24:47,544 --> 00:24:51,409
Chest CT confirmed multiple lung cysts,
one of which burst during the test.

437
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:54,496
Luckily, 13 figured out the problem
and was there to re-inflate her lung.

438
00:24:54,656 --> 00:24:57,987
Lung cysts plus all her other symptoms
could be amyloidosis that we can manage.

439
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:00,366
- Or pulmonary fibrosis which...
- Thank you.

440
00:25:00,872 --> 00:25:03,274
My employees can take
care of it from here.

441
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:05,757
- We need to biopsy the cysts.
- You fired me

442
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,176
because I screwed up.
I just proved I can pull my weight.

443
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:10,618
All you proved is you know
how to make an entrance.

444
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:13,982
House, she deserves another shot.
She found the cysts, saved the patient.

445
00:25:14,102 --> 00:25:16,295
Who wouldn't have needed saving
if 13 had shown up

446
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,237
at the differential
in the first place.

447
00:25:18,357 --> 00:25:19,980
Give her her job back, House.

448
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,065
Or what?
You're gonna quit?

449
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:24,693
Go do the biopsy.

450
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,381
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:35,814
How much clearer
do I need to make this?

452
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:48,758
What does that even mean,
"dating a hooker"?

453
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,013
He's an idiot
with a messiah complex.

454
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,327
Savior to all who need saving.

455
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:58,221
That's why his first wife had
a wooden leg. Second wife was Canadian.

456
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,646
- He's the one who needs to be saved.
- From you or the ho?

457
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:03,950
The ho's just using him
for his money.

458
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:07,295
Wait.
Bad example.

459
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:09,826
Normally in these situations,
I'd follow the girl,

460
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:12,328
find out something embarrassing
about her to show him.

461
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:14,828
But since that's
our starting position...

462
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,195
Proceed directly
to the leg-breaking.

463
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:20,148
I'm not breaking her legs.
She probably has a pimp.

464
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:22,894
Or, at least, an older brother.
Or a younger brother.

465
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,406
- Or overprotective sister.
- Find her, find her family,

466
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:29,094
find client number nine.

467
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,028
Just get me something I can use
to force her to back off.

468
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:35,140
Sorry to interrupt
your meeting, Mannix.

469
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,349
Here's the result
from the lung biopsy.

470
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:52,894
Why not men?

471
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,861
You're bisexual.

472
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:59,913
If you were just being self-destructive,
you'd be having random sex with men.

473
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:03,166
Better chance of getting assaulted,
catching a disease.

474
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:06,021
If this were
just about getting laid,

475
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:08,046
it'd be a lot easier to pick up men.

476
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:10,094
Or ugly girls.

477
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:12,186
This woman's hot.

478
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:15,993
Which means you like the challenge,
the conquest.

479
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:18,598
It's the control that gets you off.

480
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,259
And controlling women
is as close as you can get

481
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:23,223
to controlling
what's gonna happen to you.

482
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:25,312
Here I thought I was just
into boobs.

483
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:27,460
Instead of getting sweaty
with a stranger,

484
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,161
why don't you try taking it
to the next level?

485
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,161
Play God.

486
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:35,198
Tell a girl that she's got
ten years to live.

487
00:27:36,693 --> 00:27:37,993
She has lam.

488
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:52,960
This is not a test. You're not getting
your job back if you can...

489
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,068
I know what it's like
to get this news,

490
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:57,637
and no one should have
to get it from you.

491
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:29,192
The biopsy of your lung cyst

492
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,338
showed smooth muscle cells.

493
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,924
That's indicative
of a disease called lam.

494
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:37,844
What do you do for that?

495
00:28:39,423 --> 00:28:41,371
Surgery to remove the cysts.

496
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:43,542
But...

497
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,478
They'll come back.

498
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:49,939
Little by little, the cysts replace
healthy lung tissue

499
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:52,110
until your lungs stop working.

500
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,049
I'm gonna die.

501
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:11,390
Yes.

502
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:21,209
I'm so sorry.

503
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,842
They removed all the cystiks.

504
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,812
That should help you breathe better.

505
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:31,898
How long until the cysts come back?

506
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,211
We don't know exactly.

507
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:36,069
I'm sorry.

508
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,407
Stop saying you're sorry.

509
00:29:44,777 --> 00:29:46,152
I know you're scared.

510
00:29:50,403 --> 00:29:51,960
I don't know what I feel.

511
00:30:01,006 --> 00:30:03,285
You're gonna be numb
for a few more days.

512
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:05,807
Then you'll go home
and cry for a few weeks.

513
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:09,681
And then you get angry.

514
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:13,440
Start telling yourself
nothing matters anymore.

515
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:16,609
You start doing stupid things.

516
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:20,987
Maybe you go out to bars
and pick up a bunch of women.

517
00:30:25,994 --> 00:30:26,911
You're...

518
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,152
How long do you have?

519
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,931
Maybe a little more than you.

520
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,468
Maybe a little less.

521
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:41,584
I'll race you.

522
00:30:55,082 --> 00:30:57,769
I was thinking maybe
I'd come back later.

523
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:11,505
Oh, god.

524
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:13,833
What's going on?

525
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:16,711
All her blood counts are down.
It's a new symptom.

526
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:18,671
- Aplastic anemia.
- Does the word "fired"

527
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:22,008
have some whole other definition
that I'm not aware of?

528
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:24,223
I don't work for you.
Fine.

529
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,721
Don't pay me.
Just let me finish out this case.

530
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:28,723
So you like her
now that she's dying.

531
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:31,660
- What happens if she stops dying?
- There's no danger of that right now.

532
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,395
If we don't figure out what's wrong
with her, she's got days, not years.

533
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:36,471
Aplastic anemia takes
lam off the table.

534
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:38,974
Unfortunately, none of
our other choices are any better.

535
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:41,803
PNH with some sort
of respiratory infection.

536
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:43,279
Best case gives her 12 years.

537
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:45,348
- Or fast-moving langerhans.
- A few months.

538
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:48,618
Or mastocytosis, which can cause
systemic shock and kill her in days.

539
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:49,598
Go.

540
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:51,579
Test for everything.
Not you.

541
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,083
You're just a visitor.

542
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,295
How's your patient?

543
00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:04,269
She doesn't have langerhans.

544
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:05,593
That's good.

545
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:08,805
Actually, a cancer diagnosis
would be good news right now.

546
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:13,821
Do you think...

547
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:16,354
I'm boring?

548
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:18,572
Yes.

549
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,703
You're saying that
just to screw with me.

550
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:26,305
Why would you expect anything else?

551
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:28,241
I expect House to pull my strings.

552
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:30,702
I expect cameron
to make me feel better.

553
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:32,579
I expect the new
team to kiss my ass.

554
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:35,415
And I expect you to be honest,
'cause you don't give a crap.

555
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:39,792
Yes, you're boring.

556
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:42,005
That speech was boring.

557
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,352
Thanks so much.

558
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,830
You don't let other people's
problems affect you.

559
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,864
You don't let your
own problems affect you.

560
00:32:47,984 --> 00:32:49,929
And it's the screw-ups
that make us interesting.

561
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:51,731
You're never out of control.

562
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:53,389
Which is good, and...

563
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:55,351
Boring.

564
00:32:56,037 --> 00:32:58,735
Never losing control also means
you're never putting yourself out there.

565
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:00,106
Never pushing your limits.

566
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,172
On the other hand,
you do have a tattoo, so...

567
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:04,448
Maybe I'm wrong.

568
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:56,522
I'm glad you're here.

569
00:34:22,484 --> 00:34:25,167
- She needs a bone marrow transplant.
- Test results are back?

570
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:26,988
- What's she positive for?
- Nothing.

571
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:28,446
But we've got a donor match.

572
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,657
Jumping to a transplant
when we don't know what she...

573
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,316
I know she has a blood disorder.

574
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,498
Could be PNH.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

575
00:34:35,618 --> 00:34:37,543
Or leukemia.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

576
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:38,603
Or thalassemia.

577
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:40,378
- She needs a bone marrow...
- I get it

578
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:42,818
But she'll never survive
total body irradiation.

579
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:44,335
So we don't radiate her.

580
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:47,893
Her marrow's nearly
wiped out already.

581
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:50,107
- Counts almost zero.
- "Almost" being the key word.

582
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:52,010
The new marrow would
attack the old marrow.

583
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,762
- She'll die from graft-versus-host.
- You got a better idea?

584
00:34:57,284 --> 00:34:58,538
She trusts you.

585
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,226
Go get her consent.

586
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:22,415
Sometimes I find out
things you'd rather not know.

587
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,510
This was in his trash.

588
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,254
He's using.

589
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:39,015
You're back.

590
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:41,934
Genius.

591
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:44,611
Damn.

592
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:47,565
I knew the fake works was too much.

593
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,411
Well, you had no choice.

594
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:53,427
Where were you gonna go
after fake hooker girlfriend?

595
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,823
How did you know he was outside?

596
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:57,227
Cane prints.

597
00:35:57,849 --> 00:35:59,287
I'm actually kind of insulted.

598
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,332
No way I'm a drug addict,
but you completely buy

599
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,123
that I fell in love
with a prostitute?

600
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:06,026
You played to your strengths.

601
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:08,127
By which I mean you
played to your weaknesses.

602
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:12,978
Oh, my god.

603
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:18,429
You invoked your dead
girlfriend's name to sell me.

604
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:21,265
You're my hero.

605
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:23,392
Best $30 I ever spent.

606
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:25,770
It's 30?
Did you keep her number?

607
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,898
Unfortunately, I killed her
and buried her in the basement.

608
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:30,238
Shame.

609
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:31,400
Hungry?

610
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:33,076
Yeah.

611
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,807
So, seriously.

612
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,867
Where were you the other morning?

613
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:42,617
Don't make me do this again.

614
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:44,664
It has nothing to do with you.

615
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:47,492
- Then tell me.
- We're going bowling on monday.

616
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:49,391
I'm coming over to
play poker this weekend.

617
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:50,799
Nothing's changed.

618
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,328
You have to trust that.

619
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:55,049
Okay.

620
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:04,517
You're gonna keep following me,
aren't you?

621
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:05,874
It's what we do.

622
00:37:08,948 --> 00:37:11,983
Be outside my apartment
at 8:00 tonight.

623
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:21,348
She said yes to the transplant.

624
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:22,629
Good.

625
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:27,456
You're in a downward
spiral of destruction.

626
00:37:28,316 --> 00:37:29,314
I can stop.

627
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:31,320
You're gonna keep spiraling.

628
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,545
Keep screwing around.

629
00:37:32,939 --> 00:37:35,675
Keep slashing away at every person
who tries to help until

630
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,826
no one tries to help anymore.

631
00:37:38,096 --> 00:37:40,261
- Till you hit bottom.
- Till you're dead.

632
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:44,811
Until then...

633
00:37:46,546 --> 00:37:47,727
I can use you.

634
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:53,900
You're hiring me back?

635
00:37:56,225 --> 00:37:57,713
You did good work.

636
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:06,776
I did good work yesterday,

637
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:08,393
and I was still fired.

638
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:09,513
What changed?

639
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:16,892
You wanted me to
spend time with her.

640
00:38:17,636 --> 00:38:19,947
See if I could still
make a connection.

641
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:22,511
You connected with a diagnosis,
not with her.

642
00:38:23,547 --> 00:38:26,252
You're trying to save me,
trying to control me.

643
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:28,396
You're doing exactly
what you think--

644
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:29,516
cracks.

645
00:38:31,986 --> 00:38:33,564
You're lips are cracked.

646
00:38:37,163 --> 00:38:39,195
You been using your inhaler lately?

647
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:40,951
Allergies.

648
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,259
Don't deflect.
You always deflect.

649
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,368
Did she cry?

650
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:50,164
When you told her that
she was gonna die, did she cry?

651
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:53,019
She... got upset. She--

652
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:55,294
were there tears?

653
00:38:57,758 --> 00:38:58,589
No.

654
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:07,121
Chopping an onion releases a mist

655
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:09,809
of syn-propanethial-s-oxide,

656
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:13,023
a chemical irritant
which causes people to have a very

657
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:15,064
predictable reaction.

658
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:17,441
She has no tears.

659
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:21,255
It was either this
or put on brian's song.

660
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,072
I didn't have time
to stop by wilson's.

661
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:26,242
She has sjogren's.

662
00:39:27,107 --> 00:39:29,745
It attacks the glands
that produce tears and saliva.

663
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:32,174
Also, by the way, causes

664
00:39:32,294 --> 00:39:34,346
lung cysts and rta.

665
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:35,751
It doesn't cause bleeding.

666
00:39:35,911 --> 00:39:37,500
It's like you and men.

667
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,125
Just 'cause you usually don't,
doesn't mean you can't.

668
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:42,937
And it doesn't cause
cracked lips in other people.

669
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:44,808
Lack of spit makes her mouth

670
00:39:44,928 --> 00:39:47,112
a breeding ground for
a fungus like candida.

671
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:49,765
Your asthma inhaler
did the same for you.

672
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:52,346
Wiped out your
mouth's immune system.

673
00:39:52,752 --> 00:39:55,021
So she's got what I've got.

674
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:59,859
Just the opportunistic infection,
not the underlying condition.

675
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,281
Another life saved
by girl-on-girl action.

676
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,042
I'm gonna be okay?

677
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:19,866
You're gonna be okay.

678
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:24,916
Methylprednisolone to get
the sjogren's under control.

679
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,471
And some artificial
tears to maximize

680
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,722
the visual impact of this moment.

681
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,308
Spencer's gonna be fine.

682
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:48,586
And I hear you got your job back.

683
00:40:53,862 --> 00:40:56,248
I'm gonna keep standing
here until you say something.

684
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:06,843
I feel alone.

685
00:41:11,028 --> 00:41:13,735
And she hasn't gone anywhere.

686
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,227
She gets to live.

687
00:41:27,411 --> 00:41:28,889
I'm gonna go home.

688
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:30,228
I'm tired.

689
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:47,831
What do you think?

690
00:41:51,818 --> 00:41:53,347
Oh, my god!

691
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:56,023
You guys shop here too?

692
00:41:57,103 --> 00:41:58,602
Best nipples in princeton.

693
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,146
Why are you here?

694
00:42:00,882 --> 00:42:02,940
Because he ate the donut.

695
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:04,545
I'm so sorry.

696
00:42:04,665 --> 00:42:06,318
He must've followed me.

697
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:07,854
I'm sure.

698
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:12,116
Well, you're clearly not pregnant,
so either you're buying this as a gift,

699
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:13,768
or this is some kind of weird

700
00:42:13,888 --> 00:42:15,744
"if you build it,
they will come" moment.

701
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:17,621
I'm adopting a baby.

702
00:42:17,864 --> 00:42:19,609
She asked me to be
a character reference.

703
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:21,545
That's where I was
the other morning.

704
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:24,233
I'm sorry.
I couldn't betray her confidence.

705
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:27,840
I didn't want anyone else to
know in case I didn't get approved.

706
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:30,575
Today, I did.

707
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:45,054
Are you gonna congratulate me?

708
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:49,784
If you're happy, I'm...
