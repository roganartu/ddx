<i>You're doing good.</i>

<i>You've still got the thing.</i>

00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:06,452
<i>The stupid thing</i>
<i>is still on.</i>

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,887
<i>Mom, you don't have to</i>
<i>yell at me.</i>

5
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:09,622
I've been in labor for
over a dozen hours, Justine.

6
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:11,857
I have to yell.

7
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:14,026
I thought you were gonna
miss the whole thing.

8
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:15,995
<i>Mom, it's</i>
<i>a three-hour drive.</i>

9
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:19,465
That's why I called you
yesterday after my water broke.

10
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:21,900
<i>I'm sorry. A partner just</i>
<i>dropped a brief on my desk.</i>

11
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:22,801
<i>Okay, you're doing good.</i>

12
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:24,503
Yeah, right.

13
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,872
I remember what it's like,
but family comes first.

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,207
I need you to keep pushing.

15
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:29,875
I can see her head.

16
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:31,310
All right, come on.
We're doing good here.

17
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,711
Get this.
This is what I wanted.

18
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:33,545
<i>Gross.</i>

19
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:34,680
You're crowning.

20
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:36,248
Are you getting--
getting this?

21
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:39,485
<i>Kind of. Well,</i>
<i>not the actual vagina.</i>

22
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:41,720
It's your baby sister!

23
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:43,422
<i>It's my mother's vagina.</i>

24
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,656
Aah!
Freeing the shoulders.

25
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:46,525
Aah!

26
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,694
Oh!

27
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:50,229
Get the NICU team in here.

28
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:51,363
Baby's hypoxic.

29
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:52,398
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

30
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:54,800
What's going on?
<i>I don't know.</i>

31
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:57,836
<i>My baby!</i>
<i>How's my baby?</i>

32
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:59,405
<i>What are you doing?</i>

33
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:04,243
<i>What are they saying?</i>

34
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,378
<i>I can't tell.</i>

35
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,714
<i>Find out what's going on!</i>

36
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,549
You need to back up.
Turn that off.

37
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:11,784
She's not responding.

38
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,452
<i>What's happening?</i>

39
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,155
<i>What's wrong with my baby?</i>

Sex.

I still don't see
a female doctor in that room.

77
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,494
It's making me
very unhappy.

78
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:04,496
Fine. Out of the goodness
of my heart,

79
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:05,964
which will make you happy,

80
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:07,432
which will make you
desire me more,

81
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,800

<i>Her heart looks fine.</i>

87
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:29,521
Her liver enzymes
are elevated.

88
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:32,524
When the liver fails,
it stops producing proteins.

89
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,860
Specifically the ones
that keep your plasma

90
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:38,330
inside your blood vessels
and outside your lungs.

91
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,365
Fix the liver,

92
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,934

93
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:47,940
Foreman, you need to stay
after school.

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,415
I apparently need
to apologize.

95
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:59,451
<i>Last week, I should not</i>
<i>have gone over your head</i>

<i>The Bridges of Madison County.</i>

98

99
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,529
Go find a woman,

100
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:13,232

grin off your face.

101
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,399
<i>This'll be quick.</i>

102
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:15,834
I've been interviewing
people all week.

103
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:16,969
I have it narrowed down
to two candidates.

104
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,537
Well, narrow it
down to one

105
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,739
before Cuddy
starts withholding sex.

106
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:24,042
Uh, she hasn't said anything
to me about that.

107
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,378
I said, wipe the grin.

108
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:33,151
<i>Yeah, she's fine.</i>

109
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:37,789
I can hear her breathing
on the monitor.

110
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:39,391
I just checked.

111
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,628
I'm checking
every ten minutes.

112
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:44,529
Fine. I'll check again.

113
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:55,107
Oh, she's so cute
when she's asleep.

114
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:56,508
You should see this.

115
00:04:56,576 --> 00:05:00,979
She's--she's--she's got
one hand over her head.

116
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:04,783
Okay, well, you take
as long as you need.

117
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,991
I'm thirsty.

118
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:48,660
Your mommy says no,
'cause she's mean.

119
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:49,995
If it was up to me...

120
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:51,930
Juice!

121
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:53,632
No.

122
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,567
Go back to bed.

123
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:07,245
I said bed!

124
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:15,487
Wilson, hey.
You up for a boys' night in?

125
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:19,291
Believe it or not,
breathing problems

126
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,226
can be caused
by a liver problem.

127
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:22,894
Then what's wrong
with her liver?

128
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,363
Probably an abscess.

129
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,865
If we find it
with the ultrasound,

130
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,467
<i>we can drain it,</i>
<i>make her better.</i>

131
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:31,570
<i>You'll be able to take her home</i>
<i>by the end of the week.</i>

132
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:33,839
Is she bleeding?

133
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:35,307
She's oozing
from her IV site.

134
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,575
It's a symptom
of liver failure.

135
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:38,009
It's what we would
expect to see.

136
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,512
Dr. Cheng, we might need
a unit of blood over here.

137
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,147
Echogenic area
in the liver.

138
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:43,281
<i>Can you make it out?</i>

139
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:44,416
Doesn't seem to have
the thick walls

140
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:46,051
you'd expect
from an abscess.

141
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,552
Lift her left shoulder
so we can get a better look.

142
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,821
Oh, can I do it? I haven't
been able to hold her yet.

143
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,357
Uh, she's hooked up to
too many tubes and IVs.

144
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:53,825
Can I at least
donate blood?

145
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,160
Of course.

146
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:56,161
We'll draw your blood
and see if you're a match

147
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:57,696
<i>as soon as we're done here.</i>

148
00:06:57,764 --> 00:07:00,999
That's definitely not
an abscess.

149
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,934
It looks like
dilated bile ducts.

150
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,270
What does that mean?

151
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,005
<i>Can I still</i>
<i>take her home soon?</i>

152
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,377
You were right
about the liver.

153
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:13,545
On ultrasound,
we found

154
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,280
intrahepatic
dilated bile ducts.

155
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,282
Extrahepatic ducts
were normal.

156
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,086
<i>Are there any masses</i>
<i>causing an obstruction?</i>

157
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:24,856
No. Are you okay?

158
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:28,160
Just talking
in a soothing voice.

159
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:30,195
Not for your benefit.

160
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:32,197
<i>Why? Is it</i>
<i>turning you on?</i>

161
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:34,266
House, there's someone
here I need you to meet.

162
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,268
<i>I just hired</i>
<i>Dr. Christina Fraser.</i>

163
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:38,003
She's a board certified--

164
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,674
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>You're fired.</i>

165
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:44,142
What?

166
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,777
<i>House, you're kidding, right?</i>

167
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:47,345
<i>I've done my due diligence.</i>
<i>She's the best there is.</i>

168
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:48,480
What did I do?

169
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:49,781
<i>You had the misfortune</i>

170
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,517
<i>to be the lesson</i>
<i>that Foreman is learning.</i>

171
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:53,752
That whooshing sound

172
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,921
is the air being
let out of his ego.

173
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:02,994
<i>You are such an ass, House.</i>

174
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,196
You could have made
the same point

175
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:05,797
without crushing the hopes
of a young doctor

176
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:07,799
who was actually excited
to have this job.

177
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,201
<i>No, I'm not sure</i>
<i>i could have.</i>

178
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:10,702
<i>I think you give me</i>
<i>far too much credit.</i>

179
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,673
Taub, it's your turn
to find a young doctor

180
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,108
who's actually excited
to have this job.

181
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:18,510
<i>For you to fire?</i>

182
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:20,545
Not until you or she
earns it.

183
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:22,514
<i>Dilated bile ducts</i>
<i>could be congenital.</i>

184
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,382
That means that it's a stricture
in the ducts themselves.

185
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,383
Caroli's syndrome.

186
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:26,852
So, open her up.

187
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,887
Surgery?

188
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,322
This is a newborn

189
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:31,857
with liver failure.

190
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,792
She's oozing blood
from every puncture site.

191
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,794
It's insanely risky
to open her up.

192
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,430
<i>Yes. It's unfortunately</i>
<i>also the only way to fix her.</i>

193
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:42,334
So make teeny, tiny incisions
with a really small scalpel.

194
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:45,036
<i>Gotta go.</i>

195
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:49,741
You told me you gave them
your credit card.

196
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,476
And you were dumb enough
to believe me.

197
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,881
Cuddy'll be back
in an hour and ten minutes.

198
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:57,582
<i>I'll be back</i>
<i>in an hour and five.</i>

199
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,385
Oh, no, you don't.

200
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:01,453
Oh, yes, I do.

201
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,787
You're not gonna
leave the kid?

202
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,322
Yes, I am,
'cause unlike you,

203
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,290
I don't have a conscience.

204
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,491
And unlike you,

205
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,726
I'm not having sex
with Cuddy,

206
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:10,295
so I actually can leave.

207
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:11,563
You're bluffing.

208
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:12,831
I'm leaving.

209
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,966
You're not gonna leave
a two-year-old unattended.

210
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,968
True.
I'm leaving her with you.

211
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:19,337
A responsible adult.

212
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:27,245
Better get
back in there.

213
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,014
Kid's all alone.

214
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,315
It's kind of bugging you,
isn't it?

215
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:31,383
Not my problem.

216
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,717
Well, since,
objectively,

217
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,553
you care more about leaving
a child alone than I do,

218
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,720
it kind of is.

219
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:36,955
Objectively,
since I never accepted

220
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,989
this responsibility,

221
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:39,291
it kind of isn't.

222
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:42,994
True, and yet it is.
Because you're you.

223
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:47,532
I'm leaving.

224
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm leaving.

225
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:56,408
You're not gonna leave.
You can't.

226
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:04,983
Fine.

227
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,518
You're right.

228
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:08,053
You know what I can do?

229
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,721
I can go in there and call
a babysitting service

230
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,890
for 15 bucks an hour,
then call Cuddy

231
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,293
<i>and tell her who's</i>
<i>watching her kid and why.</i>

232
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:20,031
I'll stay if you stay.

233
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,242
We were gone two minutes.

234
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,747
What have you got there,
sweetie?

235
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:38,350
<i>Come on now,</i>
<i>spit it out.</i>

236
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,288
Come on, sweetie. Open.

237
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:48,560
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah.
Bah bah bah!

238
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:49,961
Open.

239
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,429
Oh!

240
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,766
Ow!

241
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:09,314
Rachel, how many coins
did you eat?

242
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,511
Isolating
the common bile duct.

243
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,447
And mobilizing the distal end
for cannulation.

244
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:31,016
Bp is down to 50 systolic.

245
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:31,883
You've got to stop
the cannulation.

246
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:33,718
I haven't started yet.

247
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:34,820
<i>Hit her with a bolus</i>
<i>of phenylephrine.</i>

248
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:36,054
That should buy us
enough time

249
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,225
<i>BP is rising. 70 systolic.</i>

250
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:43,662
Nice. I'm in
the common bile duct.

251
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:45,363
Advancing past
the cystic duct.

252
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:47,132
No strictures
or blockages so far.

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,266
<i>BP is dropping again.</i>

254
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,468
Another bolus
of phenylephrine.

255
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:50,635
<i>She can't take more.</i>

256
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:52,437
<i>BP is still dropping.</i>

257
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,005
We've got to pull out.
We're done.

258
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:55,240
I was barely in.

259
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:58,243
This doesn't make sense.

260
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:00,011
The liver problem alone

261
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,546
is not gonna mess
with the baby's BP.

262
00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:03,315
Whatever this is, it's got
to be affecting her heart.

263
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:04,382
Heart plus the liver.

264
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,884
Could be
tuberous sclerosis.

265
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:07,519
Or it could be
a vascular malformation

266
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:09,588
in the liver,
causing both problems.

267
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:11,389
So what do you guys think
of Dr. Cheng?

268
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:14,226
Best treatment for a vascular
malformation is surgery.

269
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:15,460
And I think
your wife thinks

270
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,195
you shouldn't think
anything of Dr. Cheng.

271
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:18,263
No surgery.

272
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:19,364
A newborn baby
can't handle

273
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:20,532
another trip
to the O.R.

274
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,967
I didn't mean think think.

275
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:26,371
I meant think
as a potential hire.

276
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,440
What if we started
the baby on steroids

277
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:31,009
an anti-angiogenesis agent,
and dopamine?

278
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:33,011
Could work
just as well as surgery.

279
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,113
Snap those
bad blood vessels shut.

280
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:36,815
I'll call House
to get approval.

281
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:38,950
So, what was that shrug?

282
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:40,919
A "Dr. Cheng
could work" shrug?

283
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:42,387
Or a "House
is gonna crush you

284
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:45,223
for even considering her"
shrug?

285
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,925
You suck.

286
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,493
House is gonna hate
anyone we hire,

287
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,428
because he doesn't
want to hire anyone.

288
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:51,730
So you think
I should abstain?

289
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:53,365
Just give the decision
back to him?

290
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:55,467
Then he'll just mock you
for being a wuss.

291
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,402
You're screwed.

292
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,307
Unless House feels like
hiring her is his idea.

293
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,376
<i>Still not answering.</i>

294
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:05,977
We should just
start the treatment.

295
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,050
She opened up
a Chinese food bag

296
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:13,351
to eat money.

297
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:14,686
What an idiot.

298
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:16,988
Okay, you ordered
the moo shoo pork

299
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:18,523
and the orange cashew
chicken, right?

300
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:19,824
Like I always order.

301
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,126
Did you clean up
in there?

302
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:22,260
Yeah.
It's good enough.

303
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:24,229
Okay, so with tax,

304
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:26,898
the change should
have been 68 cents.

305
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,467
There's only
58 cents out there.

306
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:30,869
There's a dime missing.

307
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:33,805
Well, he could have
shortchanged you.

308
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:35,740
Fridge magnet's
not getting anything.

309
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:37,609
<i>That's because</i>
<i>it's a fridge magnet,</i>

310
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:39,077
and unless she swallowed
a Canadian dime,

311
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:40,045
it's not magnetic.

312
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,880
Really?

313
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:44,249
I mean, kids swallow things
all the time, right?

314
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,318
I mean, she swallowed a dime,
she poops it out.

315
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:47,719
She'll be fine.
Absolutely.

316
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,054
Unless it gets stuck
in her intestine

317
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,689
and causes a blockage,
which could kill her.

318
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,592
Then she won't be fine.

319
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:55,227
You have to tell Cuddy.

320
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,195
Well, then I won't be fine.

321
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:58,496
If you don't tell Cuddy,

322
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:00,665
I will go out there
and tell her myself.

323
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,400
Yeah? What are you
gonna tell her?

324
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,769
Are you gonna tell her
that you left coins out

325
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:06,538
and you left her child
unsupervised?

326
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:09,975
Hey, hey, hey! You are not
gonna pin this on me!

327
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:14,479
Rachel needs to be
monitored for 24 hours

328
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:15,814
<i>to see</i>
<i>that the dime passes.</i>

329
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:18,550
You know, just to make sure
she doesn't die.

330
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:21,119
You're telling me
to do the right thing

331
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:22,487
while climbing out
a window?

332
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:24,756
Shh shh shh shh shh!

333
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,193
Tell her!

334
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:39,704
<i>Did she wake up at all?</i>

335
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:41,006
One time.

336
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:44,943
That's not like her.
Is she all right?

337
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:47,145
She's fine.

338
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:52,484
How about
I stay the night?

339
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:54,619
Then you can
really thank me.

340
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,454
I have to get up early.

341
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,722
Won't be able to sleep in.

342
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,891
I'm a deep sleeper.

343
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:13,171
<i>Round two.</i>

344
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:14,439
<i>Did Justine go home?</i>

345
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:16,675
Said she was going downstairs
for a few minutes.

346
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,710
A few hours ago.

347
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:20,845
So you two are close?

348
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:23,114
Well, it's been
getting better actually.

349
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:25,050
<i>At least she's here</i>
<i>in the building.</i>

350
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:26,618
<i>That's pretty supportive</i>
<i>for her.</i>

351
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:29,721
What is it?

352
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,790
She's pinker.

353
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:33,425
Is that bad?

354
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:35,994
That's good.

355
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:40,865
That's very good.

356
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:43,335
Was that her?

357
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,676
Can I hold her?

358
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:54,979
I think it's long overdue.

359
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:56,915
<i>Oh!</i>

360
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:02,520
Oh.

361
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:06,257
My first time.
Finally.

362
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:09,094
<i>Technically,</i>
<i>it's your second time.</i>

363
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:11,329
I didn't mean--

364
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,231
I know, mom.

365
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,736
Mmm.

366
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:30,582
Looks like it was
a vascular malformation.

367
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:31,616
The Grogan baby
is better.

368
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:35,120
Okay, ready, honey.

369
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:38,223
So stay very, very still
and hold your breath.

370
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,292
Don't move.

371
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,895
She moved.
They always move.

372
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:47,899
It is a good job.

373
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,667
<i>Diagnostics.</i>

374
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:51,302
<i>Solve a mystery,</i>
<i>save a life.</i>

375
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,739
But I suppose you're
pretty attached to pediatrics?

376
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,207
I'm sorry, Ms. young,

377
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:58,610
but I'm gonna have to ask you
to restrain your daughter.

378
00:16:58,677 --> 00:16:59,978
Now the mom's
not gonna want to do it

379
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:01,079
because she'd rather
I just keep

380
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:02,280
blasting her daughter
with radiation.

381
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,117
You're telling me

382
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,886
there's an opening
in House's department?

383
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:10,121
Would you be interested?

384
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:12,657
No more kids,
no more parents.

385
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:14,592
One case at a time
instead of 17?

386
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,127
Set up the interview.

387
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:18,830
It's possible you won't
need to interview.

388
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:33,878
Relax, I got this.

389
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,613
Oh, thanks.

390
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:44,055
Pfft!

391
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:01,639
Is everything okay?

392
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:05,643
Yeah, sorry,
I'm just new to all this.

393
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,741
You want me
to reset the alarm?

394
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:28,719
God, no.

395
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,321
Case is under control.

396
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,523
<i>I'm sleeping in.</i>

397
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:35,092
Your boss must
really like you.

398
00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:42,133
<i>Hey, marina.</i>

399
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:43,367
<i>Pasta's in the fridge</i>
<i>for lunch.</i>

400
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:51,075
I assume, since you're
lling so early,

401
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,544
that the surgery
was a rousing success.

402
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,413
<i>And I assume,</i>
<i>since you still think</i>

403
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,847
<i>we actually did</i>
<i>the surgery,</i>

404
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:57,582
you haven't checked
your messages in eight hours.

405
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,417
Where are you?

406
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:00,818
<i>I believe this is</i>
<i>what your people term</i>

407
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:02,086
a poopie call.

408
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:03,988
Uh, the word is Booty.

409
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:04,889
Well, I don't know
what you're doing,

410
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:06,290
but this is a poopie call.

411
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:07,892
<i>It's not caroli's syndrome.</i>

412
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,393
<i>Dr. Cheng spotted a--</i>

413
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:10,895
whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what?

414
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:13,431
<i>I know about the jew,</i>
<i>the black, and the croc hunter,</i>

415
00:19:13,498 --> 00:19:15,266
<i>but when did we get</i>
<i>our Asian persuasion on?</i>

416
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:18,102
Dr. Cheng is the NICU
attending on the case.

417
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,570
And she's not here.

418
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:22,740
Well, then I just wasted
a perfectly good racial epithet.

419
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:25,543
She spotted
a vascular malformation

420
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,677
<i>in the baby's liver.</i>

421
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:27,878
<i>Good call.</i>

422
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:29,113
<i>Except for everything</i>
<i>you just said.</i>

423
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:30,581
There's no way
that our patient

424
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:32,116
has a vascular
malformation.

425
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:33,351
<i>And you can tell that</i>

426
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:34,385
from the vast amount
of information

427
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,621
you've gleaned
from not being here?

428
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:37,688
<i>Don't need to be there</i>
<i>to remember</i>

429
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:38,689
<i>that the patient's A.L.T.S</i>

430
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:39,991
<i>were three times normal.</i>

431
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:41,792
The baby's liver damage
is far too extensive.

432
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,527
Dr. Cheng's an idiot.

433
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:46,597
In fairness, it wasn't
completely her idea.

434
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:48,566
More of a Foreman
kind of thing.

435
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,167
<i>Well, then you're</i>
<i>an even bigger idiot</i>

436
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:51,535
<i>for trying to cover</i>
<i>for her.</i>

437
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:54,305
House, we treated for
a vascular malformation,

438
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:55,573
and she got better.

439
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,608
No, she didn't.

440
00:19:57,676 --> 00:20:00,945
<i>Call me</i>
<i>when she crashes again.</i>

441
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:03,614
That went well.

442
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:13,524
Everything okay?

443
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:17,862
Come on.
I know that look.

444
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:20,865
I'm just not used to seeing
such emotion coming from you.

445
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,199
I just gave birth.

446
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:24,935
I'm, like, one big vat
of hormones right now.

447
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:26,437
<i>It's not just</i>
<i>the hormones, mom.</i>

448
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:28,706
You're different with her.

449
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:30,841
<i>It's okay.</i>

450
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:34,845
It's good. It's just...

451
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:36,681
I can't help thinking,
where was this mom

452
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:38,783
when I was growing up?

453
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,252
Wow.

454
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,653
I never realized
you considered me

455
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,155
such a failure
as a mother.

456
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:45,122
<i>I don't consider you</i>

457
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,123
a failure.

458
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:47,625
I just--

459
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:51,996
I never knew that
there was an alternative.

460
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:59,437
Hmm.
I think she feels wet.

461
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:00,905
Can you hold her a sec?

462
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:02,707
I'm gonna grab a diaper.

463
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:06,177
Okay.

464
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:08,512
Mom, something's wrong.

465
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,350
Oh! Nurse!
She's bleeding again!

466
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:18,222
All right,
she's in her office.

467
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,657
Move fast.

468
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:21,625
You see a double-wide tuchus
coming this way,

469
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:23,828
you scream like a girl.

470
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:25,029
If Rachel wakes up,

471
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:26,564
she's gonna tell Cuddy
everything.

472
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:27,865
She's two.

473
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,333
Last night,
she was whining

474
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:31,102
about the giant moose that
lives outside her window.

475
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:32,403
Medusa at 6:00.

476
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:34,572
Don't look back.
Move, move.

477
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:51,689
Hello.

478
00:21:57,462 --> 00:22:01,565
Hello, I'm the friendly moose
who lives

479
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:03,401
<i>outside your bedroom.</i>

480
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:05,269
<i>She hates that moose.</i>

481
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:06,337
Hand me the gel.

482
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,541
Okay.

483
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:13,277
Make it short.

484
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:15,212
Do not pardon the pun.

485
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,582
<i>She's crashing again.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

486
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,652
Is it actually important that
I understand what you say?

487
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,787
<i>What?</i>

488
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:33,330
Yeah?

489
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:34,598
<i>The baby's bleeding again.</i>

490
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,200
I'm shocked.

491
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:37,468
Oh, no, wait a minute.
That's you.

492
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:38,335
<i>Yes.</i>

493
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:39,703
You're a genius.

494
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:41,605
The bleeding means her liver
is still failing.

495
00:22:41,673 --> 00:22:42,673
<i>It's not a vascular</i>
<i>malformation.</i>

496
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:44,408
House, come take
a look at this.

497
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:45,976
Hold that thought.

498
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:47,878
<i>House, no!</i>
<i>I need you!</i>

499
00:22:47,946 --> 00:22:50,614
Just past
the ileocecal valve.

500
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:51,549
<i>It's nothing.</i>

501
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:53,617
It's just
an irregularity.

502
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:55,319
It's a dime.

503
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:57,154
Or a pocket of air.

504
00:22:57,222 --> 00:22:58,823
Yeah,
with FDR's face on it.

505
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,524
That's not a face.
It's a shadow.

506
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,626
House, the thing
is perfectly round.

507
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:05,229
Well, move the wand
to the side.

508
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:06,564
Tickles!

509
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:09,099
That's because
I'm the tickle monster.

510
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:12,002
Gonna tickle you
even more!

511
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,071
Look at--look at that.

512
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:15,473
We need an X-ray
to be sure.

513
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,475
Great, just give her

514
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,176
an unnecessary dose
of radiation.

515
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:20,244
It's a dime.

516
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,781
<i>House, I know</i>
<i>you're in there.</i>

517
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:26,050
<i>Open the door!</i>

518
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,892
I saw your extension
on the call.

519
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,093
What are you doing
down here?

520
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:39,029
Uh, Wilson's got
a two-year-old with cancer.

521
00:23:39,097 --> 00:23:41,365
She's in a lot of pain.
It's very sad.

522
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:47,571
He also has an outstanding
bedside manner.

523
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:49,073
<i>Her liver failure</i>
<i>is getting worse.</i>

524
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,808
You were right.
Now what?

525
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:55,279
The interesting question
is not why she's worse now

526
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:56,914
but why she got better
in the first place.

527
00:23:56,982 --> 00:23:58,949
Could have been something
we did that temporarily

528
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:00,017
<i>relieved the--</i>

529
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:01,352
what'd you put her on
again?

530
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:02,686
After the transfusion,
we gave her steroids,

531
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:04,655
dopamine, and the anti--

532
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:07,224
steroids can treat
idiopathic hepatic fibrosis.

533
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:08,859
<i>It would explain why she</i>
<i>got better and then worse.</i>

534
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,895
But not the multiple
dilated ducts.

535
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:13,797
<i>House, I need you</i>
<i>back in here!</i>

536
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,500
Cancer kid
trumps liver kid.

537
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:19,904
Sorry. Confidentiality.
There are rules, you know.

538
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:24,441
<i>That is a dime.</i>

539
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:25,876
<i>It looks mobile.</i>

540
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:27,211
<i>And it's right in</i>
<i>the middle of the colon.</i>

541
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,947
Prime location
for pooping out.

542
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,982
We'll give her some laxatives
to help it on its way.

543
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,652
Sounds to me like
someone's going to get

544
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,954
some yummy chocolate.

545
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:37,922
Chocolate.

546
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:39,423
<i>Yum yum yum.</i>

547
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:43,227
You're gonna make
a great mommy one day.

548
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:51,702
Thanks for waiting.

549
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,470
<i>Hook the mom up to the baby.</i>

550
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:54,705
Direct blood transfusion.

551
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,173
And what else?

552
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,541
Nothing else.

553
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:09,720
It's amazing.
She's pink and healthy again.

554
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,591
Mother's touch.

555
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:16,827
It's a miracle.
Thank you.

556
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:20,497
A blood transfusion
isn't a cure.

557
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:22,299
Or a miracle.

558
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:26,170
Then why does the baby
seem like she's cured?

559
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:30,874
I have no idea.

560
00:25:37,424 --> 00:25:40,293
Our patient can either
go through life

561
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:42,404
with the world's longest
umbilical cord,

562
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:46,107
or we can discuss the
differential for magic blood.

563
00:25:52,315 --> 00:25:54,649
Baby's O2 sats
are holding.

564
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:56,484
Either you're Dr. Cheng

565
00:25:56,552 --> 00:25:58,687
or you're early
for my mani-pedi.

566
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:00,155
I thought
her expertise could--

567
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:02,157
could tell us the O2 sats.

568
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:04,326
I hope you come with
some original ideas.

569
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:05,560
<i>Either the mom's blood</i>

570
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:06,728
is special,
which would mean

571
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,096
it's treating
something specific,

572
00:26:08,164 --> 00:26:09,631
which means the baby
has a disease.

573
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:11,566
<i>Or mom's blood</i>
<i>is just blood,</i>

574
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:13,869
<i>and it's replacing something</i>
<i>the baby is missing,</i>

575
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:16,771
which means the baby has
a simple deficiency.

576
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:22,444
Given the liver failure,

577
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:23,945
a deficiency
of clotting factors,

578
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:25,814
enzymes, or vitamins
are the most likely.

579
00:26:25,882 --> 00:26:27,015
<i>So let's find out.</i>

580
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:27,916
Hook the baby up
to someone else's blood

581
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:29,584
and see if she gets better.

582
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:30,752
Find a donor.
<i>I'm o negative.</i>

583
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,987
Universal donor.

584
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:33,154
Hook yourself up.

585
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:35,390
Dr. Cheng, hook me up.

586
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:38,159
Walk with me.

587
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:41,196
My team seems to have
taken a shine to you.

588
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:42,831
I like them too.

589
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:45,400
I assume you're hanging around
because you want a job.

590
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:47,068
That would be
a fair assumption.

591
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:48,770
Well, I'm gonna
have to test you.

592
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:52,040
Let's say,
two-year-old...

593
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:54,476
Swallowed a coin
20 hours ago.

594
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:55,777
She's gonna be fine,
right?

595
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:57,612
Any signs of obstruction?

596
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,514
For the purposes
of this quiz,

597
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:02,284
let's say, not yet.

598
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:03,952
I'd give a laxative,

599
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,520
although I wouldn't
wait too long.

600
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:07,289
Her bowel could
become ischemic,

601
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:08,757
or worse,
an intussusception.

602
00:27:08,824 --> 00:27:10,392
Define "too long."

603
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:12,227
Another six hours, max.

604
00:27:12,295 --> 00:27:13,561
By then,
her system is clear.

605
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:14,963
If it's not out,
it's not coming out.

606
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:16,831
And then what do I do?

607
00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:18,934
I mean, what do you do?
It's your test.

608
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:21,803
I'd go in with a scope
and get it.

609
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:23,939
Did I pass?

610
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,741
It's not up to me.
Talk to Taub.

611
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:33,481
<i>Men's room?</i>

612
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:35,951
It turns out, toilets
are handy in this situation,

613
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:38,286
and I felt relatively sure
that Cuddy wouldn't come in.

614
00:27:38,354 --> 00:27:39,621
Oh, Cuddy's been in here.

615
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:42,257
Seriously?

616
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:45,193
This must be a terrible
place to have se--uhh!

617
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:47,395
Is there such a place?

618
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:49,230
Okay, six more hours,

619
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:50,799
then we're going in with a scope
and pulling it out.

620
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:53,001
Scope a two-year-old?
It's dangerous.

621
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:54,502
And as you
keep pointing out,

622
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,538
so is a dime ripping
through her intestines.

623
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:58,506
Cuddy will be home
from work in six hours.

624
00:27:58,574 --> 00:27:59,574
But no big deal.

625
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:00,742
I'll just scream,
"look over there,"

626
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,676
while you quickly
shove a scope

627
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:03,378
up her daughter's rectum.

628
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:04,913
<i>I could offer</i>
<i>to baby-sit again,</i>

629
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:06,314
let her have the night out.
<i>Sure.</i>

630
00:28:06,382 --> 00:28:07,582
That won't raise
any suspicions.

631
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:12,420
I wish I was nicer.

632
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:14,422
<i>Hey.</i>

633
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,358
Give me
your radiation dosimeter.

634
00:28:16,425 --> 00:28:17,525
Why?

635
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:20,228
Because it matches my eyes.

636
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:52,494
I think we can say
this isn't working.

637
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:53,795
We'll get her back
on your blood.

638
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:54,996
That'll help for now.

639
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:56,865
But this means
there's an infection.

640
00:28:56,932 --> 00:28:59,234
<i>First we need to</i>
<i>identify it.</i>

641
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:01,336
We know it's in her liver,
so we'll get a sample.

642
00:29:01,404 --> 00:29:02,470
Then we can figure out

643
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:05,740
<i>how to help her</i>
<i>get better.</i>

644
00:29:05,808 --> 00:29:07,108
I had this baby

645
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:11,279
because I wanted a chance
to be a special mom.

646
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:14,182
But not this way.

647
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:28,963
Problems in radiology.

648
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:32,667
A radiation dosimeter badge
turned positive.

649
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:35,336
I could have a CT Scanner
that's leaking

650
00:29:35,404 --> 00:29:38,106
or a spilled vial
of thallium somewhere.

651
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:39,574
I don't even know
whose badge it was.

652
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:40,775
The code was scratched off.

653
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:44,112
That had to be intentional.

654
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,880
I mean, why would anyone--
<i>I don't know.</i>

655
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:48,583
All I know is that
I'm gonna need to work late.

656
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:51,252
I was actually hoping
that you could baby-sit.

657
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,421
No.

658
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:54,489
Please.

659
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:55,523
Two nights in a row?

660
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:56,491
<i>Please.</i>

661
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,526
I have a life, you know.

662
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,764
I will make it
worth your while.

663
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,170
I am not going to bargain
babysitting for sex.

664
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:12,373
Who the hell said that?

665
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:13,575
Of course I will.

666
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:15,310
Thank you.

667
00:30:24,086 --> 00:30:27,956
Oh, that thing's
nearly as big as she is.

668
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:30,825
Don't worry. I've done this
at least once before.

669
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:40,568
Advance another centimeter
and you're in.

670
00:30:43,405 --> 00:30:46,107
Oh, God, that looks awful.
Is that from the infection?

671
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:50,478
No. It means
we were wrong.

672
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:53,481
It's a melanoma.

673
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:56,117
You mean, like skin cancer?

674
00:30:56,185 --> 00:30:58,620
How would she get that?
She's never been outside.

675
00:30:58,687 --> 00:31:01,723
But you have.

676
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,160
You're saying
I gave my baby cancer?

677
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,022
I found a mole under the nail
on her left index finger.

678
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,207
The biopsy revealed
it's melanoma.

679
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:29,045
That's it?

680
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,313
How come no one
got me food?

681
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:32,782
What do you mean, "that's it"?
The woman has melanoma.

682
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,749
She could die if we don't--

683
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:34,917
boring.

684
00:31:34,985 --> 00:31:36,318
Since the baby
has the melanoma,

685
00:31:36,386 --> 00:31:37,553
we kind of already knew
the mom had it.

686
00:31:37,621 --> 00:31:39,655
Yes, but now we know
where it is,

687
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:42,191
so we can treat it
much more effectively.

688
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:43,392
<i>Great. So treat her.</i>

689
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,994
Also boring.

690
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:48,397
What's interesting
is that mom's melanoma

691
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:50,032
spread to the baby
in utero,

692
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,233
which means
it's metastatic,

693
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:52,902
which means it's
late stage.

694
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:55,337
How many people with
a late stage melanoma

695
00:31:55,405 --> 00:31:58,240
are as healthy as she is?

696
00:31:58,308 --> 00:32:00,810
Clearly, something's
going on in mom's blood

697
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,678
that's treating her melanoma
as well as her baby's.

698
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:04,113
Antibodies.

699
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:05,081
If her immune system
was fighting the melanoma,

700
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:06,582
it never would have spread.

701
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,284
Exactly, which means
it's fighting something else,

702
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,485
and the melanoma cells

703
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,120
are getting caught
in the crossfire.

704
00:32:11,188 --> 00:32:13,322
<i>So what's mom's immune system</i>
<i>really shooting at?</i>

705
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,791
Scleroderma can cause
cancer-fighting antibodies.

706
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:16,859
So can Churg Strauss,

707
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:18,227
pretty much
any auto-immune disease.

708
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:20,129
Or infections
that cause granulomas,

709
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,697
TB, mycobacteria.

710
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:22,665
<i>See, Dr. Cheng?</i>

711
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:23,999
This is not boring.

712
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,534
<i>Start with auto-immune.</i>

713
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:27,136
Go test her blood.

714
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:29,238
And leave your food.

715
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:36,378
Just a little pinch.

716
00:32:36,446 --> 00:32:37,913
Ah.

717
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:44,453
So, uh, I'm not actually
making her better.

718
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:45,855
I'm making her sick.

719
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,323
You can't blame yourself.

720
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,158
I ate all the right foods,

721
00:32:49,226 --> 00:32:51,193
I read all the books
and the studies,

722
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,363
and I even hired
a private Detective

723
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,266
to research
each sperm donor.

724
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:59,401
<i>I just missed</i>
<i>one big thing.</i>

725
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:03,706
My own cancer.

726
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,474
<i>I'm all done here.</i>

727
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,209
We'll have
the results soon.

728
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,611
And if that's
what this is?

729
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:10,212
An auto-immune disease?

730
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,680
<i>Treatment's fairly simple.</i>

731
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:13,682
And if it's
something else?

732
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:18,220
Let's just take this
one step at a time.

733
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:25,094
Stop beating yourself up.

734
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,204
<i>I'm sorry, mom.</i>

735
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:39,175
Not just for this,
but for what I said earlier.

736
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:41,744
<i>I was jealous</i>

737
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:45,681
and angry,
and I lashed out.

738
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:48,417
But you were
a great mom.

739
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,420
You are a great mom.

740
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:56,859
I don't deserve
such a good daughter.

741
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:09,605
Negative
for scleroderma.

742
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:14,143
So, what did House
want earlier?

743
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,778
He just gave me
a little quiz

744
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,379
and said he was okay
with hiring me,

745
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:19,181
but that
it was your decision.

746
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:20,850
Negative for
dermatomyositis.

747
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:23,319
He's just saying that
to set me up.

748
00:34:23,386 --> 00:34:25,454
So you're not
offering me the job?

749
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,590
If he wants me
to offer you the job,

750
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:28,858
something's going on.

751
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:31,727
That was my thinking too.

752
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:33,762
It's not lupus.

753
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,664
Things with House are never
as simple as they seem.

754
00:34:35,732 --> 00:34:37,099
Trust me, he's got
an ulterior motive,

755
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,468
and I've got to figure it out
before I do anything.

756
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,704
Okay.

757
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:44,006
Mom's negative
for Churg Strauss.

758
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:45,441
This isn't auto-immune.

759
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:47,543
Time to scan her
for infections

760
00:34:47,611 --> 00:34:49,378
that could cause
granulomas.

761
00:34:53,683 --> 00:34:56,118
Third poop
in the last half hour.

762
00:34:56,186 --> 00:34:57,620
Still nothing.

763
00:34:57,687 --> 00:34:58,854
<i>All right, that's it.</i>

764
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:01,290
Time's up.

765
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,426
Operation Valkyrie
is now in effect.

766
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,006
Either it's a trap or it's not.
Just hire her.

767
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,675
Lungs clear
for granulomas.

768
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,343
Yeah, who cares?

769
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,313
Did you enjoy that bear trap
snapping on your leg yesterday?

770
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:26,815
You realize it's just
a metaphorical trap?

771
00:35:26,883 --> 00:35:28,550
You'll still have
all your limbs.

772
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:32,321
Fourth rib about
the midclavicular line.

773
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:34,490
<i>You're over-thinking this.</i>

774
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:36,325
House fired my pick
sight unseen.

775
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:38,360
He was never even interested
in Chase's pick.

776
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,663
He was only obsessed with
how she reflected on Chase.

777
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,565
Dr. Cheng is the only candidate
he's actually responded to.

778
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:45,267
<i>You wanted House invested.</i>

779
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:47,336
He is. Hire her.

780
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:50,606
And you think
<i>I'm</i> over-thinking this?

781
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:52,708
Shut up and hire her.

782
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:57,346
Look.

783
00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:02,651
Oat cell lung cancer.

784
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,320
She has two cancers?

785
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,823
Cancer treating cancer?

786
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:13,730
<i>You have lung cancer.</i>

787
00:36:19,998 --> 00:36:22,266
I thought I had
skin cancer.

788
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:25,670
As unlikely as it sounds,
you have both.

789
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:28,973
Actually, the lung cancer
is basically treating

790
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,341
the skin cancer.

791
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:31,943
It's why you're not
feeling sick

792
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,078
and why your blood's
helping your baby.

793
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:36,047
<i>We found it early,</i>
<i>so it should be treatable.</i>

794
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:38,983
<i>In a way, your daughter</i>
<i>saved your life.</i>

795
00:36:39,051 --> 00:36:40,184
We'll get you set up
for the surgery

796
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:41,219
and start you on chemo.

797
00:36:42,888 --> 00:36:44,956
What about Kayla?

798
00:36:45,023 --> 00:36:47,692
<i>She'll only need</i>
<i>the chemo.</i>

799
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,694
Can't you just keep
giving her my blood?

800
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:52,163
Not once we cut out
the tumor.

801
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:53,831
Your body will stop
making the antibodies

802
00:36:53,899 --> 00:36:56,000
that are keeping
your baby healthy.

803
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:58,503
Can you hold off
on my surgery?

804
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,637
<i>Over the last day,</i>

805
00:36:59,705 --> 00:37:02,206
your baby's liver tumors
have shrunk 15%.

806
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:03,574
Projecting forward,

807
00:37:03,642 --> 00:37:05,443
it would take
eight or nine days

808
00:37:05,511 --> 00:37:06,978
to completely eradicate
her cancer cells.

809
00:37:07,045 --> 00:37:09,247
So let's take
the eight or nine days--

810
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:11,282
the cancer
probably won't spread

811
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,018
in the next nine days,
but there are other risks.

812
00:37:14,086 --> 00:37:16,821
Cancer thickens your blood,
which could cause clots.

813
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:20,057
What are the risks to
putting my baby on chemo?

814
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:24,495
It could damage her brain
or affect her development,

815
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:26,130
<i>but these risks are small</i>
<i>compared to the risks</i>

816
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:29,333
that you would be taking by
leaving your cancers untreated.

817
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:34,672
I want to wait.
<i>Mom.</i>

818
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,209
Are you listening?
This is way too dangerous.

819
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:40,011
I'll take the risks.

820
00:37:40,078 --> 00:37:41,712
I want what's best
for my daughter.

821
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,247
I'm your daughter too.

822
00:37:43,315 --> 00:37:45,550
She's a baby.

823
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:47,185
<i>You're an adult.</i>
So what?

824
00:37:47,252 --> 00:37:49,520
I don't need my mom
anymore?

825
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:51,823
No. You never did.

826
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,524
'Cause I wasn't there
for you.

827
00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:55,526
<i>But look at you.</i>
<i>You turned out great.</i>

828
00:37:55,594 --> 00:37:56,961
Oh, you don't know
if I'm great.

829
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:58,629
You don't know me at all.

830
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:01,065
And I'm not gonna let you
martyr yourself

831
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:03,100
for a two-day-old infant
just because you feel guilty

832
00:38:03,168 --> 00:38:05,703
because you weren't
around for me.

833
00:38:07,406 --> 00:38:11,209
I'm not martyring myself.
It's nine days.

834
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:15,746
Let's hold off
on the surgery.

835
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,321
You brought food?

836
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:26,090
This is a medical procedure,
not a dinner date.

837
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:28,593
I'm aware that this
is a delicate procedure.

838
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,428
I'm also aware
that my hands are shaking

839
00:38:30,495 --> 00:38:33,297
from low blood sugar 'cause
I haven't eaten all day.

840
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:35,399
So while this
may seem insensitive,

841
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:39,570
this crucial,
lifesaving moo shoo--

842
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:42,240
where are
my extra pancakes?

843
00:38:42,307 --> 00:38:44,075
Damn it, they forgot
the extra pancakes

844
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:46,544
for my moo shoo pork.

845
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:49,447
Every time that new girl
with the blue streak in her hair

846
00:38:49,514 --> 00:38:53,184
answers the phone,
they screw up.

847
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,921
Was she there when
you picked up the food?

848
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,222
You ordered extra pancakes?

849
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,092
<i>How much did they cost?</i>

850
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:08,332
Where--
55 cents.

851
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,368
And there were two.

852
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:12,770
So that means the total
on the last bill was--

853
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,605
was--

854
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:17,441
$18.42.
$18.42.

855
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:21,245
Rachel couldn't have
eaten a dime

856
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:24,115
because there was
no extra dime.

857
00:39:25,684 --> 00:39:27,351
Yeah.

858
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:35,259
So the image that we saw
on the ultrasound--

859
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:36,727
was obviously just
a pocket of air,

860
00:39:36,795 --> 00:39:38,296
like I said all along.

861
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:41,232
But you saw
the worst case scenario,

862
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,502
like every irrational,
worried parent.

863
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:47,171
You'd make
a terrible mommy.

864
00:39:48,607 --> 00:39:51,575
Want to give me
some dumplings?

865
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:06,123
Mom, I brought you some--

866
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:07,858
mom?

867
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:10,928
Mom!

868
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:14,365
Mom.

869
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:21,505
We need help in here!
Somebody help us!

870
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,912
<i>Massive pulmonary embolism.</i>

871
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,547
<i>She died in seconds.</i>

872
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:31,983
Wouldn't have happened if she
let us remove the tumor.

873
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,652
Probably not.

874
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,588
Postmortem, we were able
to harvest all of her blood.

875
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:40,558
It's enough
to treat the baby.

876
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:43,527
That's something.

877
00:40:43,595 --> 00:40:44,962
Pretty amazing case.

878
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,764
Thanks for your help.

879
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:49,734
I was glad for the chance
to work it with you.

880
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:51,268
I've thought about it,

881
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:56,340
and I'd like to
formally offer you the job.

882
00:40:58,477 --> 00:41:01,712
It's funny, I wanted to
work on House's team,

883
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,614
until I started
working with his team.

884
00:41:03,682 --> 00:41:05,282
Yeah, I know. Chase and
Foreman can get a little--

885
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,651
actually, it's you.

886
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,688
I get that House is an ass,
but at least he owns it.

887
00:41:10,756 --> 00:41:11,856
You don't understand.

888
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:14,625
This whole thing
was just a game to House.

889
00:41:14,693 --> 00:41:16,660
I didn't have a choice.

890
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:19,230
You're a grown man,
Dr. Taub.

891
00:41:19,297 --> 00:41:21,165
You can make whatever
choices you want,

892
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:23,434
and instead of hiring me
when he said you could,

893
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:27,405
you chose to act like
a paranoid, scared little kid.

894
00:41:27,472 --> 00:41:30,708
I hate kids.

895
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:33,944
Good-bye, Dr. Taub.

897

898
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:47,058
I'll make sure
you never forget her

899
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:49,960
and what she did for you.

900
00:41:53,832 --> 00:41:57,701
She was just trying to be
the best mom in the world.

901
00:42:01,306 --> 00:42:03,274
She was.

902
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:30,234
This one's all yours.

903
00:42:30,302 --> 00:42:32,636
What happened
to helping out?

904
00:42:32,704 --> 00:42:34,538
I did.

905
00:42:52,858 --> 00:42:54,492
<i>Did someone go poopie?</i>

906
00:42:58,763 --> 00:43:00,264
<i>What?</i>

907
00:43:00,332 --> 00:43:03,367
<i>How did you eat a dime?</i>

908
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:05,803
<i>House.</i>
