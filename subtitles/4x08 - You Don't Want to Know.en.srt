1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:06,166
The Chinese Water Torture Cell was
invented in 1911 by Harry Houdini.

2
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,543
Nothing like new material.

3
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,840
He was lowered
head-first into the water.

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,679
His ankles were locked and
bolted to the top of the tank.

5
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,884
I'm going to need a volunteer.

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,154
Ooh! Ooh!

7
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,888
The guy dislocating his
shoulder, right there.

8
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,461
Could you tell the guy
next to you to come up?

9
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,826
Come on, get up there, man.
Get up there, man! Come on!

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,700
Come on!

11
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,039
Hi, have we met before? No.

12
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,342
See, if you'd said, "Yes," you
could've gone back to your seat.

13
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,216
Now, can you vouch for this audience
that this is a glass tank full of water?

14
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,377
Yeah. No, you can't.

15
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,012
You haven't done anything yet. Come on.

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,557
Knock on the glass.

17
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,592
Solid glass. Knock on it.

18
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,890
It's real water, too.
Ilana, splash the guy.

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,994
Does that feel wet to you? Yeah.

20
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,331
And you think that proves it's
water? I think we have met.

21
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,734
Do you know the public washroom
behind the truck stop east of Omaha?

22
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:12,930
No. See, if you'd said, "Yes,"

23
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,405
that would have been so funny.

24
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,903
Hold out your arms for me.

25
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,335
You've done this before, right? No.

26
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,905
Again, two choices and you
went for the unfunny one.

27
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,560
Now, remember. There's only one
thing you've got to be able to do.

28
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,969
Drag a screaming, crying shackled
man out of a tank of water.

29
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,233
Up!

30
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,209
Hey, you can swim, right?

31
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,411
Tell me you can swim!

32
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,011
Yeah.

33
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,613
Two answers, man. Two answers!

34
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,304
Is that part of the act?

35
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,773
I'm new. I think so.

36
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,644
Maybe not.

37
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,681
Get up here!

38
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,158
Aw.

39
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,301
Five eager doctors, and no sick people.

40
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,832
Let us try and fill our spare
time with a new challenge.

41
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,009
The winner gets immunity...

42
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,138
I've a sick guy. I saw
this magician last night...

43
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,513
The girl's fine. He didn't
really cut her in half.

44
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,246
His heart stopped while he was
hanging upside down in a water tank.

45
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,550
A drowning man's heart
stopped? That is a mystery.

46
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,591
Along with immunity, the
winner gets to nominate two...

47
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,025
He lost consciousness almost
as soon as he hit the water.

48
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,394
You have to leave work at 6:00 p.m., 
but you make time for man dates?

49
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,522
What's the challenge?

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,192
Are we not allowed to be friends?

51
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,259
<i>I'm just hurt. When I asked
you to come see Mamma Mia...</i>

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,395
No history of heart
disease, no angina, no...

53
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,494
He's lying.

54
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,904
About his history? ER confirmed...

55
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,374
About everything. He's a
magician. That's what they do.

56
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,413
He screwed up the trick, started
drowning and he got a cardiac arrest.

57
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,107
You were talking about a challenge?

58
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,674
The winner nominates
two of your competitors.

59
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,748
I will fire one of them.

60
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,087
Even if he was drowning,

61
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,957
it would have taken longer
to set off a cardiac incident

62
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,120
without some underlying problem...

63
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,222
Fine. Go run your tests.

64
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,823
If you're wrong, you're fired.

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,060
If I'm right, do I stay?

66
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,593
If I say no, are you going
to let your patient die?

67
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,967
What's the challenge?

68
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,568
We can all applaud the doctor who's
willing to break all the rules.

69
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,639
But the real hero is the unsung doctor,

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,312
toiling in anonymity, because he
broke the rules without getting caught.

71
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,151
I need to know you have these skills.

72
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,622
I need you

73
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,587
to bring me the thong of Lisa Cuddy.

74
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,322
Not kidding.

75
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,664
Thong, Cuddy, go.

76
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,177
It's how I got hired.

77
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,374
You're actually considering this?

78
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,552
If you want to stand on principle,
I really respect you for that.

79
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,385
It's childish, unprofessional
and inappropriate.

80
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,549
The job is not worth it.

81
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,857
We should all beg off, tell him
we failed, no winners, no losers.

82
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,225
Fine.

83
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,122
You're going to do it, aren't you?

84
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,896
Of course I'm going to do it.

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,136
No valvular regurgitation, no wall motion
abnormalities, no other structural defects.

86
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,907
If you didn't sound so despondent,
I'd say that was good news.

87
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,482
No. It is for you, not for him.

88
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,711
Notice any heaviness in your
legs the last couple days?

89
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,252
Why isn't it good news for you?

90
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,085
Because if there's nothing
wrong with you, he gets fired.

91
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,489
Seriously? Somewhat
seriously. Your legs?

92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,221
Haven't noticed anything
out of the ordinary.

93
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,559
Shortness of breath?
Would it help if I puked?

94
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,002
Pick a card.

95
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,630
Any tightness in your chest or arms?

96
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,002
Pick a card.

97
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,062
You don't seem too worried.

98
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,369
Would you please pick a card?

99
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:20,503
Our boss thinks your cardiac arrest was
just a result of you accidentally drowning.

100
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,845
Your boss is an idiot. Put
it back. Shuffle them up.

101
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,747
So, then, why aren't you worried?

102
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,911
Either I'm dying or I'm not.

103
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,284
I mean, I don't want
the ride to be over,

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,757
but unless worrying is some
new form of treatment...

105
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,459
Your card. No.

106
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,894
I'm going to prep you for
a transesophageal echo.

107
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,023
You sure you shuffled these?

108
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,192
And I'm going to need to sedate you.

109
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,896
Might wanna check your wallet first.

110
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,802
Would you check your wallet?
It's part of the trick.

111
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,349
That's my card. How did you do that?

112
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,182
Do it again?

113
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,828
Thought you weren't playing. I'm not.

114
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,367
She'll fire you if she catches you.

115
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,165
I don't think she can fire me for
not trying to steal her panties.

116
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,671
You trying to will them off?

117
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,104
If I had a plan,

118
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,508
the first part would be not
telling you what the plan was.

119
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,306
You haven't touched that coffee.

120
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,472
Yes, I have.

121
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,644
She can't keep her panties on
if they're wet. We work together.

122
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,816
One wins, protects the other.

123
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:40,291
Or, I win by myself, and then you try
desperately to convince me to spare you.

124
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,762
Dr. Cuddy!

125
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,296
Dr. Taub, are you okay?

126
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,233
I just tripped. I'm so sorry.

127
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,795
I have some extra time. Do you
need any help in the clinic?

128
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,068
Okay.

129
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,342
We found no apparent cause for the
arrest. TTE and TEE revealed no...

130
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,478
Send the patient home.
You can give him a lift.

131
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,545
We checked for clots, we checked for...

132
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,715
You're reporting to me because
you're scared to report to House,

133
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,986
because you found nothing,
because this isn't a case.

134
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,528
And you thought I'd save your ass.

135
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,029
Yeah.

136
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,698
I thought he was sick.
What was I supposed to do?

137
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,234
What about his lungs? Decreased oxygen
saturation leads to heart failure.

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,240
ER didn't find anything.
ER wasn't looking.

139
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,709
Too busy trying to keep
him alive. Get an MRI.

140
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,383
<i>Clinic. Yes, can you ask Dr. Cuddy</i>

141
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,580
to come to the nurses' station? Stat.

142
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,212
<i>Right away.</i>

143
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,377
I asked you to get Dr. Cuddy.

144
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,974
Dr. Taub said she'd be right out.

145
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,717
A fungus in my lungs? How would
I even get something like that?

146
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,888
Well, right now it's just a
theory. We don't even know if...

147
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,091
God, I knew I shouldn't have
done those mushrooms in college.

148
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,326
I'm sure there's no connection.

149
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,766
It was a joke.

150
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,303
You really lose your sense of
humor when your job's on the line.

151
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,499
Sorry. Most dying people
don't really like to...

152
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,138
Not that you're dying.

153
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,677
But a little sick would be perfect?

154
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,178
Yeah.

155
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,246
My stomach!

156
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,946
Stabbing or throbbing?

157
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,618
Grey Turner's sign. He's
got internal bleeding.

158
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,817
I'll call surgery.

159
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,887
The surgeons have transfused
three units AB positive,

160
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,553
but they're still looking
for the source of the bleed.

161
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,496
No trauma. Could be liver
disease, vitamin K deficiency.

162
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,330
Only thing we know for
sure it's not, nothing.

163
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,393
And we would've noticed something
chronic like liver disease.

164
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,234
It's probably an intestinal infarct.

165
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,672
No, I got it!

166
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,543
Eau de Cuddy.

167
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,413
No way. How did you get them?

168
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,747
Only one way.

169
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,247
These are not Cuddy's panties.

170
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,348
You don't think that I...

171
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,449
No.

172
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:31,292
Also, she's wearing a red bra today.

173
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,229
Like I'm the only one who noticed.

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,264
Means that the downstairs will match.

175
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,360
Do your research, people.

176
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,770
An intestinal infarct could be
linked to the cardiac arrest.

177
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,239
Hike up your skirt.

178
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,038
That's rude, even for you.

179
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,911
Hike it down then. You're wearing a
black bra. Let's see the underwear.

180
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,277
No!

181
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,384
You two cut a deal.

182
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,383
If you're not cheating,
you're not trying hard enough.

183
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,293
So, you're not wearing any underwear?

184
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,797
There's a guy bleeding...

185
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,269
Foreman, she's not wearing any
underwear. You used to be more fun.

186
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,338
She's not wearing any
underwear, big deal.

187
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,068
When she stops wearing clothes,
then we can drop the medical stuff.

188
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,403
Let me see the MRI film.

189
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,704
We didn't get any images.

190
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,678
He started screaming as
soon as I turned it on.

191
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,236
Define soon.

192
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,546
I didn't even get a chance to sit down.

193
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,014
You guys ever wonder

194
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,851
how he was going to get
out of that water tank?

195
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,423
You, come.

196
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,095
Lacerations in his digestive
tract and his spleen is shredded.

197
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,971
Ladies and gentlemen, I
have nothing in my hands,

198
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,067
nothing up my sleeve.

199
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,776
I do have something in my pants,

200
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,110
but it's not going to help
with this particular trick.

201
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,774
Watch closely.

202
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,819
How you been? Fine, 'til now.

203
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,691
Ta-da!

204
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,924
Now, you disappear.

205
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,398
Look familiar?

206
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,144
The MRI's magnet ripped this through
your intestine into your spleen.

207
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,340
Forgot about that, on
account of almost dying.

208
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,114
Where's Dr. Kutner?

209
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,153
He's no longer on your case.

210
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,518
'Cause there's nothing wrong with you.

211
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,921
I didn't screw up that trick.

212
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,484
Everything that's
happened can be explained

213
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,189
by you being forgetful and incompetent.

214
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,855
You screwed up, you passed out...

215
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,493
Know my favorite time to lie?
When my life hangs in the balance.

216
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,935
Your life doesn't hang in the balance.

217
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,666
You know your life doesn't
hang in the balance.

218
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,332
Your reputation might hang...

219
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,171
You ever do magic as a kid?

220
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,246
You seem like the type.
Lonely, obsessive...

221
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,213
I outgrew it. You?

222
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,408
Pick a card?

223
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,952
Too much trouble. Can
I just pick my nose?

224
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,647
I am not a hack.

225
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,185
I tell you how it's
done, will you go home?

226
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,466
Guess you're going to make it
magically appear in my wallet...

227
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,663
You are a hack.

228
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,182
I don't screw up.

229
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,394
Nosebleed that major
means he's actually sick.

230
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,037
Means the cardiac arrest was a symptom.

231
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,398
Stop gloating.

232
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,498
I'm not gloating.

233
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,702
Then what's that smirk?

234
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,540
No smirk, it's just how I look.

235
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,135
What about the underwear challenge?

236
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,739
I declare it officially on hold.

237
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,182
Not really fair, but I get it.

238
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,661
It's Cuddy's.

239
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,726
Pull down your pants.

240
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,102
You think I'm lying?

241
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,074
No, I want to give you a reward.
Yes, I think you're lying.

242
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,743
Cardiac arrest plus nosebleed. Go.

243
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:44,407
Patient has no significant family
history, no angina, no prior attacks.

244
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,006
What if isn't his heart?

245
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,416
What if it's the
vessels around his heart?

246
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,955
Polyarteritis nodosa causes
cardiac symptoms and hypertension,

247
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,182
which makes his nose bleed.

248
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,455
You know what else makes your nose
bleed and your heart race? Cocaine.

249
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,552
Guy works in a B-list
nightclub in Atlantic City.

250
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,565
He's got to be taking
regular rolls in the snow.

251
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,261
You, take the gloater to
the patient's drug den.

252
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,304
Make sure you pat down his
pockets before you leave.

253
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,896
You and Big Love, biopsy a blood
vessel from around the heart.

254
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,374
Test for polyarteritis nodosa.

255
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,444
You, in my office.

256
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,478
Those aren't my panties.

257
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,816
I know.

258
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,417
Hypothetical.

259
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,790
A young woman does
something clumsy in public,

260
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:35,191
and instead of laughing it off, she
gets irrationally upset. Explain.

261
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,630
Maybe she's clumsy 'cause she's nervous

262
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,763
'cause she forgot to do
her spelling homework.

263
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,536
Well, in my hypothetical, she's eight.

264
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,070
This girl's not insecure.
Seems more like she's afraid.

265
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,114
Do you have a point, or did you
just get a new book of riddles?

266
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,878
I think you're hiding
a medical condition.

267
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,477
I'm not.

268
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,316
I'm glad we had this talk.

269
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:02,918
Doctors often try to ignore their symptoms,
because they think they can't get sick.

270
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,260
If you've got something going
on, I need you to take care of it.

271
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,766
And I take your compassion
entirely at face value.

272
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,495
It's not compassion.
It's self-interest.

273
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,762
I want my team healthy.

274
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,964
It's not self-interest. It's curiosity.

275
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,301
I dropped a file, House.

276
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,776
I start bleeding from the eyes,
I'll be sure to make an appointment.

277
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,806
Okay.

278
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,313
Well, found some pot.

279
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,444
Bag it.

280
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,181
I'm not sure it really
fits the symptoms.

281
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,816
Of course not, but it'd be
irresponsible to leave it here.

282
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,586
You have a quarter? No.

283
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,062
How did Cole get those
panties off Cuddy?

284
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,155
They were never on her.

285
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,199
No way those are hers.

286
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,024
Aha.

287
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,026
Tularemia.

288
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,538
No, he'd have to have rabbits.

289
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:51,269
True, maybe a tick jumped from a rabbit

290
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,938
and landed on one of these
white, fluffy alligators.

291
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,209
Then it jumps onto our patient,

292
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:01,548
transfers the bacteria, causes
pericarditis, explains everything.

293
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,889
What are you giving me?

294
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,452
How'd you do the trick?

295
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,794
If I explain, it becomes mundane.
You lose the actual magic.

296
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,064
What do you mean, "The actual magic"?

297
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,332
You think you're actually
sawing women in half?

298
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,965
You going to tell me
what's wrong with me or not?

299
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,876
Magic is cool. Actual
magic is oxymoronic.

300
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,409
Might not even be oxy.

301
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,643
You're not going to tell
me unless I tell you?

302
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,552
You got a nurse to plant the card.

303
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,248
I can't get a nurse to help me pee.

304
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,846
You got a buddy to plant the card.

305
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,415
The fun is in not knowing.

306
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,101
The fun is in knowing.

307
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,366
My head. Oh, I've got a headache.

308
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,168
How bad? Is it new?

309
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,369
It's not too bad.

310
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,881
I'll just take one of these Vicodin.

311
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,020
You eat a lot of beets, you
have an electric toothbrush

312
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,359
and you sleep less
than six hours a night.

313
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,692
That's impressive.

314
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,599
The red betamine from the beets stains
the plaque deposits on your teeth,

315
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,170
which are then swirled by
your spinning toothbrush.

316
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,706
Your heavy lids and your
prematurely aging skin

317
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,867
tell me that you're
carrying a major sleep debt.

318
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,672
That was way cooler
before you explained it.

319
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,110
It was meaningless until I explained it.

320
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:39,082
People come to my show because
they want a sense of wonder.

321
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,951
They want to experience
something that they can't explain.

322
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,025
If the wonder's gone
when the truth is known,

323
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,356
there never was any wonder.

324
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,690
You have tularemia from your
rabbits. I put you on antibiotics.

325
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,529
You'll be better in a couple of days.

326
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,130
Sorry to spoil the mystery.

327
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,405
Thank you.

328
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,620
I'll get it.

329
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,825
Oh, my God!

330
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,985
You're not wearing
underwear. Of course, I'm...

331
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,791
A skirt that tight, you got no secrets.

332
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,061
A skirt that tight I can
tell if you got an I IUD.

333
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,294
Have you seen Dr. Cole?

334
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,393
No...

335
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,298
You're blushing. I am not.

336
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,838
Look at me.

337
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,433
Oh, my God!

338
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,677
How'd you do it?

339
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,509
So I'm safe?

340
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,953
In this job, yeah. Your
crotch, on the other hand...

341
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,251
How'd you do it?

342
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,623
Prayer, mostly.

343
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,492
Just tell me. Does Cuddy
have her groove back?

344
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,334
It'd be rude of me to discuss.

345
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,933
You handed over her panties.

346
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,601
I don't think gallantry's
really an option at this point.

347
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,804
If I tell you, then where is the magic?

348
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,814
He passed out. Ultrasound
revealed bleeding around his heart.

349
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,611
We drained 100 cc before it stopped.

350
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,844
The antibiotics aren't working.

351
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,147
It's obviously not tularemia
or any other infection.

352
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,348
Excuse me, we were talking.

353
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,481
Bleeding around the heart
could mean botched biopsy.

354
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,547
When Cole was looking for...

355
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,820
Why would you accuse the man

356
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,385
who decides your fate of screwing up?

357
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,292
Those really were her panties?

358
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,428
Cole has traveled through
the forest of crustaceans

359
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,267
and brought us a treasure.

360
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,001
He has earned his reward.

361
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,700
If I could just get
the immunity, I would...

362
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,108
No, Sophie. You can't.

363
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,545
Use whatever criteria you want.

364
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,310
Could be a clotting issue.

365
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,218
If he developed DIC after the surgery,
even a normal biopsy bleeds out of control.

366
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,813
So, cardiac arrest and DIC.
What's the common denominator?

367
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,688
Could be cancer. We've
been looking at his chest

368
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,124
since he got here. It's clean.

369
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,389
So the main mass is somewhere else.

370
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:09,126
Throws off a clot, blocks an artery
in his heart, causes the arrest.

371
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,031
Good. Go find out where
he's hiding his cancer.

372
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:20,176
If you swallowed any more metal
now would be a good time to tell us.

373
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,076
My hands feel kind of numb.

374
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,210
You lost a lot of blood.

375
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,256
I'm going to die.

376
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,383
Everybody gets scared in the hospital.

377
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,620
You're sick, you feel awful...

378
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,356
No.

379
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,399
This time tomorrow,

380
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,930
I'll be dead.

381
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,949
So who's going on the block?

382
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,680
He thinks he's dying.

383
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,121
He's probably right.

384
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,791
Tomorrow.

385
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,056
You decide to put me
up, I totally get it.

386
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,119
Nothing personal.

387
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,722
I haven't decided anything.

388
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,858
But you don't like me.

389
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,401
I like you.

390
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,432
There's some fluid in the lungs.

391
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,167
No masses.

392
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,769
I'm manipulative. I play the game.

393
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,645
I can be a bitch.

394
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,976
There's a dark spot.

395
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,442
Damage from where the
key ripped through.

396
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,952
You're probably expecting
me to bash the others.

397
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:41,390
Give examples of how they screwed
up. You know I can. I'm a good doctor.

398
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:46,253
As good as anybody around
here. Probably better.

399
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,630
And you know that's the
only thing that matters.

400
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,234
What's that?

401
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,647
It's not a tumor, it's another
bleed. This one's in his kidney.

402
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,018
And his thigh. He's
bleeding all over the place.

403
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,322
His timetable may be right on.

404
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,396
It was creepy. The patient
predicted his own death.

405
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,800
Would have been more impressive if he
predicted that he wasn't going to die.

406
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,030
Of course, that takes longer to prove.

407
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,436
Could be a symptom.

408
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,632
Sense of impending doom.

409
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,039
Yeah, could be adrenal gland disorders,

410
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,702
blood issues, anaphylaxis...

411
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,576
If you're going to kiss
his ass to protect your ass,

412
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,615
at least wait until
he's had a good idea.

413
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,411
It's a symptom of him being a charlatan.

414
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,384
He's a second-rate magician
with a mysterious illness.

415
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,715
Why wouldn't he predict his own death?

416
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,222
If he's wrong, we all forget it.
If he's right, he goes out a legend.

417
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,053
He got scared right after a transfusion.

418
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,787
Tainted blood has been known to
cause a sense of impending doom.

419
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,055
It could also explain the DIC.

420
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:55,065
I predict all your
pagers go off right now.

421
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,163
But if it had happened...

422
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,638
Anyone bother looking at his panel?
His immunoglobulin levels are low.

423
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,935
That doesn't tell us
anything specific...

424
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,740
Are you acting stupid because
you know you're safe? Clever.

425
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,305
Low immunoglobulin plus failing
heart, plus fluid in the lungs,

426
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,748
plus internal bleeding
equals amyloidosis.

427
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,980
He's bleeding way too
much for amyloidosis.

428
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,351
Say anything about his
hands or feet feeling weak?

429
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,791
He said his hands felt numb, but
that's explained by the blood loss.

430
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,499
No! Do not give me credit for that.

431
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,967
Close doesn't count. That's how
people get sucked into this stupidity.

432
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,129
He's seizing.

433
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,797
Somebody stabilize him.

434
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,698
The rest of you pull his medical
records. Go back 10 years.

435
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:42,143
Look for joint pain, fatigue,
anything associated with amyloidosis.

436
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,675
Mr. Finn, nod if you can hear me.

437
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:48,980
You had a grand mal seizure.

438
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,919
We're giving you liquids
and an anticonvulsant.

439
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,751
Just try to rest.

440
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,353
Pulse is dropping. He's stabilizing.

441
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,194
You're not going to put
me on the block, are you?

442
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,390
I haven't decided who I'm going to pick.

443
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,898
It's cool.

444
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,765
His legs look swollen to you?

445
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,428
Slight swelling could be renal.

446
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,995
I baby-sat for you.

447
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,531
I decided I'm going to make my decision
based solely on who deserves to be here.

448
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,078
That's admirable, though stupid.

449
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,879
You shouldn't save the strongest.
You should get rid of the strongest.

450
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,349
Eliminate your competition,
which is definitely not me.

451
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,079
And I'm your friend.

452
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,620
And how you going to explain to your kid

453
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,283
that I can't take him to the zoo
next week because you got me fired?

454
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,019
Kutner, he's going to seize again.

455
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:34,794
Flank pain, his kidneys are shutting
down. Also, Amber's a racist.

456
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,728
You knew they'd get paged?

457
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,294
I noticed a trend.

458
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,967
If nobody does anything,
sick people often gets sicker.

459
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,704
Do you think it's remotely
possible they had sex?

460
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,304
They're both single. It's
still legal in the blue states.

461
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,110
She barely knows him.

462
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,650
You know, in some cultures,

463
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:57,085
hiring people to steal someone's
underpants is considered wooing.

464
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:00,488
You should move there, because
here it's just, you know, creepy.

465
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,652
This was no woo. This
was an effective test!

466
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,826
This is beneath my skills.

467
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,559
Kidneys are shutting down.

468
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,897
Led to a sodium deficiency
and caused him to seize.

469
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,233
Kidney failure means that I
was right about amyloidosis.

470
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,763
Except that nothing in his medical
history remotely indicates amyloidosis.

471
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,401
So, kidney failure proves
I'm right about the bad blood.

472
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,741
Bad blood doesn't explain
the heart or the liver.

473
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,338
His major symptoms didn't start
until after we transfused him.

474
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,111
His cardiac arrest's no longer
considered a major symptom?

475
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,516
Not when it's caused by drowning.

476
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,986
So your new theory is that you
were an idiot to take this case.

477
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,647
Yes. Can I go test that theory now?

478
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,420
Waste of time. He needs a bone
marrow transplant for the amyloidosis.

479
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,756
You'd have to irradiate him first.

480
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:38,921
If they're right about the blood,

481
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,431
you'd be destroying his
immune system for nothing.

482
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,957
Which could be a good thing.
Does he have a really crappy life?

483
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,766
Go prove I'm right. Do a
subcutaneous fat biopsy.

484
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,670
At least let us eliminate
the bad blood theory.

485
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,437
Check the blood banks for
mis-marks and contamination.

486
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,577
You got two hours.

487
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,810
That's completely arbitrary.

488
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,785
No, if I'd said that you've
got three lunar months,

489
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,151
that'd be completely arbitrary.

490
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:05,951
Two hours is how long
it's going to take Big Love

491
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,821
to finish the biopsy
that you guys can't do,

492
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:11,350
because you're wasting
two hours checking blood.

493
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,452
Nine, three!

494
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,895
Five, all!

495
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,202
Hey, brought you something
from the cafeteria.

496
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,670
It's not a bribe. This is a bribe.

497
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,570
How much?

498
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,774
$1 million.

499
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,974
$5,000.

500
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,416
This is so wrong.
House specifically said

501
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,319
you can use whatever criteria you want.

502
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,916
I've got money. You need money.

503
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,556
Hand me that slide.
Right now, you're earning

504
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,622
what I'm earning, which is miserable.

505
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,567
I know what school your kid's
at. I know what it costs.

506
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,073
I've seen his picture.

507
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,968
He's going to need braces.

508
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,607
No RBC damage.

509
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,978
Nothing wrong with storage.

510
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,449
I'm going to double-check
type and start cultures.

511
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,310
We still got 32 minutes left.

512
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,549
Time flies. What have you found?

513
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,648
You're checking up on them.

514
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:16,158
It means Cole's finished with
the biopsy and it was negative.

515
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,785
Inconclusive.

516
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,619
The fat doesn't always
give you the answer.

517
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,598
You need to biopsy his actual
organs, lungs, kidneys, liver.

518
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,464
We stick another needle
in him, he'll hemorrhage.

519
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,833
Unless we start
treatment for amyloidosis.

520
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,769
Unless it's not amyloidosis.

521
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,104
If he has an infection,
the radiation will kill him.

522
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,473
Show me evidence of infection.

523
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,011
We need more than two hours.

524
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,909
Some of these cultures will
take at least a day to grow.

525
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,914
He'll be dead in a
day. Like he predicted.

526
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,348
No, he'll be half a day off.

527
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:44,513
Would it make you guys feel any better if
I let you argue with me for three minutes

528
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,352
before I order you to
treat for amyloidosis?

529
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,825
No. Just treat for amyloidosis.

530
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,327
No, don't.

531
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,826
You're playing the Cuddy card?

532
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,026
That's why I'm here.

533
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,364
Amyloidosis was your idea.

534
00:28:58,436 --> 00:28:59,528
I was wrong.

535
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,868
Yeah, me, too. You were never fun.

536
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,471
Give me the blood.

537
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,274
I'm type AB. Give me the blood.

538
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,837
Whatever's in there
could be killing him.

539
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,314
In where?

540
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,874
How much tainted blood do
you think they keep in here?

541
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,146
How many people have gotten sick from...

542
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,212
It would have to have been the
first batch, the splenectomy.

543
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,517
That's when the symptoms started.

544
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,457
Okay, let's transfuse
blood from those donors.

545
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,690
I'll be fine, we'll move
on, treat for amyloidosis.

546
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,799
Fill 'er up!

547
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,202
I have a new theory.

548
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,474
You're not stubborn.

549
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:44,011
You're not going to get checked
because you already know the answer.

550
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,577
I found an old picture in your wallet.

551
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,812
Of course you did.

552
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,518
I wasn't snooping. I needed lunch money.

553
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:59,026
I figure it's your mom, except
she looks about 32 years old.

554
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:04,199
Now, the only reason not to
update a photo in 20-odd years,

555
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,603
is she's not talking to you,

556
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,501
which would be interesting,

557
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,009
or she's dead, which
would also be interesting.

558
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,513
She's dead.

559
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,043
So is Grover Cleveland.

560
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,787
Pretty young to have a dead mom.

561
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,951
Even younger 20 years ago.

562
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,386
I Googled her obituary.

563
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:38,593
Said she died at New Haven
Presbyterian after a long illness.

564
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,738
Parkinson's?

565
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,946
Huntington's chorea.

566
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,178
I'm sorry.

567
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,424
I'm leaving when this case is over.

568
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,119
No, you're not.

569
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,194
You don't want a doctor on your team

570
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,992
who's slowly losing control
of her body and mind.

571
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,863
Huntington's isn't the only
thing that causes tremors.

572
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,493
You think it's just a coincidence?

573
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:16,335
I think you're the only one
on the team who drinks decaf.

574
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:23,304
I've been switching it out with the
regular ever since you dropped that file.

575
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,976
You're trembling because
you're hopped up on caffeine.

576
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,650
The first file wasn't my fault.

577
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,282
Medical explanation for
that is, people drop things.

578
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,724
I've been walking around
thinking I'm dying.

579
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:37,954
You are.

580
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,155
You don't know that.

581
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,892
With Huntington's, it's inevitable.

582
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:44,526
No, you don't know,
because I don't know.

583
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,036
How could you not get tested?

584
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:55,670
If your mom had it, it's a 50% chance
you're a bomb waiting to explode.

585
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,511
Not knowing makes me do things
I think I'm scared to do.

586
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,144
Take flying lessons, climb
Kilimanjaro, work for you.

587
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,751
Yeah, 'cause if you knew, you
couldn't do any of those things.

588
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,183
What?

589
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,284
You're sweating.

590
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,193
You're burning up.

591
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,934
House, you're sick.

592
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,802
Could be pneumococcus. That'd
cause chest pain and a stiff neck.

593
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,241
It's not pneumococcus.

594
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,506
Let me check your lymph nodes.

595
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,212
I'm not the patient!

596
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,078
The patient is the one
whose body is shutting down.

597
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,708
I'm having a benign
transfusion reaction.

598
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:38,346
Pseudomonas would present as an
armpit rash. Take off your shirt.

599
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,550
You first. House, you
gotta let us do this.

600
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,853
We can't biopsy him without
bleeding him to death.

601
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,258
You are not biopsying me.

602
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,990
How's your stomach? Any diarrhea?

603
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,501
The more transfusions you have, the
greater the chance of you reacting.

604
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:54,197
I've had three in a decade. The fever
will be gone in a couple of hours.

605
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,433
I heard somewhere that
doctors ignore symptoms

606
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,202
because they think they can't get sick.

607
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,039
You told us to give you the
blood so that you wouldn't...

608
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,408
I am not sick.

609
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,912
Fever is a symptom.

610
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,879
But not of what the patient has.

611
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,349
My kidneys are working. I'm
not bleeding out of every organ.

612
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,578
Yet.

613
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,188
This is a waste of time,

614
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,452
and it's distracting
you from the actual case.

615
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,987
What's wrong?

616
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,291
The room's spinning.

617
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,387
You okay?

618
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,765
Dizzy, my mouth just went dry.

619
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,029
Could be a symptom of a...

620
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,402
It's a symptom of narcotics.

621
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,105
Who spiked my...

622
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,119
What'd you drug him with?

623
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:49,159
Amber's nickname is "Cutthroat
Bitch" and you're pointing at me?

624
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,228
Got the kidney sample.

625
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,422
You're the only one
with nothing to lose.

626
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,628
Could have been you. You don't seem
to care if you get this job or not.

627
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,762
Yeah, I've been here for eight
weeks because my subscription

628
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,169
<i>to Masochism Weekly ran out.</i>

629
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:05,606
You're the only one who hasn't asked
me not to put them on the block.

630
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,509
You're either going to
pick me or you're not.

631
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,672
You're fair enough to try
to make the right decision,

632
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,309
and arrogant enough that nothing
I can say will change your mind.

633
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,819
I don't want it to be over, but,

634
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,517
unless worrying about it is
going to make a difference...

635
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,566
I'm going to run some stains.

636
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,337
He'll be less of an ass to you.

637
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,817
Patient dead yet?

638
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,216
No.

639
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,319
It's a little much for a first date.

640
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,656
Obviously, you've never dated me.

641
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:00,561
Feels like you already got
the lung and kidney samples.

642
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,189
Now I just need a piece of your liver.

643
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,496
Hey, you might want to use
a little bit of lidocaine.

644
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:05,934
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

645
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,730
Slight pinch!

646
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,843
You drugged me.

647
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,912
You drugged me.

648
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,546
Stopped by the lab.

649
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:53,482
Your mutinous team is starting to
worry about life on Pitcairn Island.

650
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,814
All your biopsies are clean.

651
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,051
Because there's nothing wrong with me.

652
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,984
Did Foreman finally okay
the amyloidosis treatment?

653
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,154
Patient's scheduled
for irradiation at 9:00.

654
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,658
You risked your life again.

655
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,330
You couldn't be sure he had amyloidosis.

656
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,960
You can't be sure that
I couldn't be sure.

657
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,470
You did one test. It was negative.

658
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:16,767
Inconclusive. Well, then,

659
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,299
by all means, flood your body
with possibly lethal blood.

660
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,777
I usually like to give the
lethal blood to Foreman,

661
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,472
but I'm the only one who's type AB.

662
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,211
Of course you're type
AB, universal recipient.

663
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,414
You take from everybody.

664
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,480
Of course, you're type
O. Universal donor.

665
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,492
No wonder you're paying three alimonies.

666
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,219
How do you know what blood type I am?

667
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,425
I don't. It just seemed
to fit the metaphor.

668
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,127
No, no, no, no.

669
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,101
Did you test my blood for something?

670
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,130
Why would you test my
blood for something?

671
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,605
I didn't.

672
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,300
You must have told me what you were.

673
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,811
Who the hell chats
about their blood type?

674
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,006
You had to have tested me.

675
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:06,152
There's no reason to ask
anyone their blood type.

676
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,252
You're about to run
out of here, aren't you?

677
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,622
Nurse, can I have a
moment with my patient?

678
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,997
He's due in radiation.

679
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,468
It's too late, he's dying.

680
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,636
Told you.

681
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,770
I'm sorry I doubted you.

682
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,845
It'd be a shame if your
secrets died with you.

683
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:38,315
Perhaps you've got that
trick written down somewhere.

684
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,348
Or maybe you want to tell me
and I'll write it down for you.

685
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,287
That way you can live on.

686
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:51,231
I'm taking it with me. See,
that way it stays magic.

687
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,471
You were wrong about everything.

688
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,132
It was never magic,
and you're not dying.

689
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,235
What's your blood type?

690
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,977
Type A.

691
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:06,840
What?

692
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,681
Trust me, it's way cooler to know.

693
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,486
Where's Finn?

694
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,384
Up my sleeve.

695
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,363
It's not amyloidosis.
And his blood's fine.

696
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,525
We just gave him the wrong type.

697
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,935
Caused the DIC, explains the
bleeding, multi-system failures.

698
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,097
But we tested his blood.

699
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,869
That's because we don't test blood
for type. We test for antibodies.

700
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,604
Because your body only
makes those antibodies

701
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,703
when you actually have
that type of blood.

702
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,373
Well, apparently, he
has one more symptom.

703
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,350
His body's making an
extra antibody, type B.

704
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,445
Combine that wit h his natural
type A and, presto, change-o,

705
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,388
he magically pulls blood
type AB out of his hat.

706
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,449
Would you stop that? God, yes.

707
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,620
Autoimmune diseases can make
antibodies go haywire, but, still...

708
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,528
It's happened. And apparently,
it's happened again.

709
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,227
I finally have a case of lupus.

710
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,271
Flush him with saline,
transfuse four units, type A

711
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,600
and start him on steroids.

712
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,835
He'll be back hoodwinking
idiots in no time.

713
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,928
Big Love, rise.

714
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,213
Use their power wisely, my Lord.

715
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,879
I nominate Amber.

716
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,146
Cutthroat Bitch, rise.

717
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,794
You're surprised?
You're everyone's pick.

718
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,788
Next victim.

719
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,391
I nominate

720
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,460
Kutner.

721
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,073
Now everyone's surprised. Why?

722
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,344
You said I don't have
to justify my picks.

723
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,510
No, I said you could use
whatever criteria you want.

724
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,485
Doesn't mean I don't wanna know.

725
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,148
He was right about
this being a real case,

726
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,854
he was right about the botched
transfusion and he's your love nugget.

727
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,294
You got no reason to pick him.

728
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,197
But somebody else does.

729
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,500
Kutner's a liability.

730
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,668
He electrocuted himself,
lit a patient on fire,

731
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,544
it's only a matter of time
before he burns the hospital down.

732
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,711
You made a deal with Cuddy.

733
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,553
That's how you got her underwear.

734
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,560
She sold it to you for the right
to put her choices on the block.

735
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,893
You said get her underwear. I got it.

736
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,160
Your scheme was brilliant,

737
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,732
and you're fired.

738
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,834
You're all about breaking the rules.

739
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,808
Her rules, not mine.

740
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,376
The whole point of this
was to subvert Cuddy.

741
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,176
You became her partner, gave her
power she didn't already have.

742
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:30,516
Let her greedy fingers into my cookie jar,
which sadly is not as dirty as it sounds.

743
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,387
Thanks for playing.

744
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,709
What the hell is this?

745
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:10,756
Looks like an envelope with the results
of a genetic test for Huntington's inside.

746
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,488
Did you look?

747
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,360
I thought it'd be fun
to find out together.

748
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,989
I don't want to know.

749
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:17,761
No, you're afraid to know.

750
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:22,571
I might die. So could you. You
could get hit by a bus tomorrow.

751
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,507
The only difference is you don't have
to know about it today. So why should I?

752
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,011
I don't have to know
the lottery numbers,

753
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,014
but if someone offered
them to me, I'd take them.

754
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,245
You spend your whole
life looking for answers,

755
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,878
because you think the next
answer will change something.

756
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,891
Maybe make you a little less miserable.

757
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,756
And you know that when
you run out of questions

758
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,626
you don't just run out of answers,

759
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,858
you run out of hope.

760
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,197
Are you glad you know that?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
