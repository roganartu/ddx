about why you don't like
working with me?

178
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,201
There's nothing to talk about.

179
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,036
House liked poking ant hills

180
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:08,604
with a stick
when he was a kid,

181
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,272
<i>and now he wants</i>
<i>to do the same with us.</i>

182
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,574
House is an ass,
but he's an intuitive ass.

183
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:14,543
He obviously noticed something.

184
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:17,212
Yeah, the fact
that we work well together.

185
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,249
He thrives on conflict and is
looking for someone to torment.

186
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,851
Don't let it be us.

187

<i>(Olivia) I don't see</i>
<i>how that's possible.</i>

188
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,227
Tommy's the most popular guy
in his office.

189
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:33,129
He's even had defendants
thank him

190
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:35,364
after they were sentenced.
Why would they thank him?

191
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:37,233
Because he doesn't treat them
like scum.

192
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:39,202
He makes them feel
like he's helping

193
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,904
by offering a plea
or even just by letting them

194
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:42,707
pay their debt
and clear their conscience.

195
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,609
And even if someone wanted
to poison him,

196
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:46,177
I don't see
how they would do it.

197
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:49,614
He never eats or drinks anything
that we haven't made at home.

198
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:51,749
Wait.
You mean literally?

199
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:52,717
Like, not even a bottle
of water?

200
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:53,952
No.

201
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,721
So he was obviously
afraid of something.

202
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,558
Yeah, rats,
mice, cockroaches.

My first job out of law school

204
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,163

If you'd have seen
some of the kitchens

206
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,232
or the processing plants
I have,

207
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,768
you'd cook
all your own food too.

any strange letters

210
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:14,006

recently?

211
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:16,108
No.

212
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:19,744
You also wouldn't have
to be at work.

213
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:21,278
We've got two young kids.

214
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:23,047
There's definitely
no poisons

215
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:24,682
I could have accidentally
been exposed to at home.

216
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:29,152
What if it wasn't an accident?

217
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,054
How are things
between you and your wife?

218

[Laughs]

219

00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:36,992
my wife is trying
to kill me?

221
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,061
Yes, I am.

222
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,997
Absolutely not.

223
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,265
This is coming
from a man

224

whose eyes
are wide open.

225
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,402

I can assure you...

229
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:53,575
I love my husband,

230
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:56,178
and I would not ever
even for a second

231
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:58,148

No, there's not even a bottle

237
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,126
Maybe we should look again.

Maybe we should leave
before the police get here.

239
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,730
Well, even if a neighbor
saw us break in

240

unless they said we were armed,

Wait.

00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:11,961
Again, given what I've seen
at Bloomingdale's...

354
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,197
Don't let House get
to you.

355
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:15,365
It's all of you.

356
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,767
I feel like you don't
respect me.

357
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:18,569
Chase certainly
doesn't try to hide it.

358
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:20,270
Chase respects you.
He's just more comfortable

359
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,206
working with me
because he's known me longer.

360
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:23,741
And I'm not just saying that
because you own a gun.

361
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:26,343
I don't own a gun.

362
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:28,712
I've thought about it,
but I'd probably end up shooting

363
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,780
someone in my own family,
like when my brother

364
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:33,016
tosses his toenail clippings
behind the couch.

365
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,451
What about you?

366
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,821
If anarchy breaks out,

367
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:39,822
I plan to do
what my ancestors have done

368
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,892
throughout the ages--run.

369
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,660
<i>(Foreman)</i>
<i>Sounds like a good plan.</i>

370
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:47,130
You got a moment?

371
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:51,668
Stop telling the nurses
I'm looking for a girlfriend.

372
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,169
What makes you--

373
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:54,870
Two lunch offers
and a box of cupcakes

374
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:56,305
since this morning.

375
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,640
So a few people
are nice to you,

376
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,076
and your first thought is,
"Hmm, this seems strange"?

377
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:02,345
I haven't even had enough time
to eat my own lunch,

378
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:05,381
much less run around trying
to recruit nurses for yours.

379
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:06,882
So can I get back to work?

380
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:11,786
You're lying,
aren't you?

381
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:14,188
It's for his own good.

382
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:16,690
He's not paranoid.
He's just stupid.

383
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:19,225
Well, shouldn't you put yourself
in that group?

384
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,994
You own a gun.

385
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:25,799
Our patient doesn't own a gun.
He owns an arsenal.

386
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,534
And I don't own a gun.

387
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:29,904
Yes, you do.

388
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,972
And you're a felon,
so you'll end up back in jail--

389
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,475
That is actually not one
of the many reasons

390
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:35,977
that I don't own a gun.

391
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,613
Why would I need a gun?

392
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:40,249
The only thing I own
worth protecting

393
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,251
a thief would need a crane
to get out of my apartment.

394
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,786
You don't own anything
you need.

395
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:45,320
You own things you want.

396
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:46,788
And you're definitely the type
who'd want a gun.

397
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:48,657
You like anything dangerous--

398
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:51,226
monster trucks,
motorcycles, fireworks.

399
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:52,961
Everyone loves fireworks.

400
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,430
Watching them,
not making them.

401
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,565
I'm telling the truth.

402
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,533
I stand corrected.

403
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,938
If you believe me,
then this issue will be resolved

404
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,539
with no further action
necessary.

405
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:08,408
Absolutely.

406
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,010
It's not resolved,
is it?

407
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,280
Not even close.

408
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,981
[Door opens]

409
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,183
It's not cocaine.

410
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:17,751
Hair samples were clean.

411
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:19,119
It's not looking good
for Fahr's either.

412
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,088
I'm not seeing
any calcifications.

413
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:22,122
You sure?

414
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,324
They can be pretty hard
to detect

415
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:24,659
in people under 50.

416
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:27,061
- See?
- What?

417
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:29,063
We all disagree
all the time.

418
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:30,532
It's not just me
and Park.

419
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,734
Nice try,

420
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:34,470
but I'm not getting
in the middle.

421
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:37,206
So why didn't you want
to go with her this morning?

422
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:38,808
She's weird.

423
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,477
She's not weird.
She's a good doctor.

424
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:43,146
Most good doctors are weird.
Look at House.

425
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:45,181
Am I weird?

426
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:47,617
Yeah, but you're hot,
so it's easier to put up with.

427
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:53,622
You're completely normal
and a pleasure to deal with.

428
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,557
You're weird.

429
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,325
In a good way?

430
00:16:57,393 --> 00:17:00,128
Maybe we should just concentrate
on the medicine.

431
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,730
You own any guns?

432
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:04,065
That's not medicine.

433
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,201
But it's related to medicine.
Kind of.

434
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:07,802
What do you think?

435
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,873
Yeah,
but not for protection.

436
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,042
Despite what the media
would have us believe,

437
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,644
you think we live
in a very safe world.

438
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:18,214
You just think
they're fun.

439
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,583
How did you know?

440
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:21,951
Working in prison,
you learned criminals

441
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,420
rarely target
random strangers,

442
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,422
and you've got more money
than you know what to do with,

443
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,425
so anything that seems different
and fun's worth trying.

444
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:29,759
And you?

445
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:31,595

448
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,168
But they're so cute.

449
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,104
They're also delicious.

Totally.

00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:46,743
There's no calcification.

453
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:49,546
Looks like we're both wrong.

454
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:51,548
You don't need to stay.

455
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:53,516

until the morning.

456

It's okay.
I'll stay.

457
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:59,322

You have a spare tire
in your car, right?

That's what those guns are.

I mean, I hope to God
I never have to use one.

He also spiked
a fever overnight.

478
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,219
It could be TB.

Yeah. It's med-speak

Systemic sclerosis can cause
lower extremity ulcers.

It would have to be
pretty far along

485
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,399

was just a few days ago.

at least a year ago.
