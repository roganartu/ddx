00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:43,435
By my actions.

538
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:46,104
Violence isn't an appropriate
way to handle conflict.

539
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:48,005
It was a moment
of weakness.

540
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:49,240
You barked at me,
picked a fight

541
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:50,674
with a painting crew.

542
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:51,675
Maybe it's time
to recognize

543
00:25:51,743 --> 00:25:53,277
it's not a character flaw.

544
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,178
Maybe it's your character.

545
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:57,014
- Pinto!
- House.

546
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,020
Embrace your inner bitch.

547
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:06,255
[Door opens]

548
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:11,995
So why did chelation
make the lungs worse?

549
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:14,598
We got about five minutes
till pinto gets back.

550
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:15,999
- Give me a hand with this.
- No.

551
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:18,903
I tracked down
another bag of plasma

552
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,137
from the batch
they used on the donor.

553
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:23,574
Negative
for all our other exposures.

554
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:26,144
Sarcoidosis
could be inflamed

555
00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:28,146
by the treatment.

556
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:29,748
I am a cripple

557
00:26:29,816 --> 00:26:31,517
in need of assistance.

558
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:35,787
Transplant team
ran an A.C.E.

559
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:37,088
Negative.
<i>It's mine.</i>

560
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:38,689
And it's your job.

561
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:40,691
My job is to assist you
in curing the lungs.

562
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:44,695
This chair will help me
do that.

563
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:51,402
What if the scrapings
from the bridge

564
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,741
chelation for lead
wouldn't have made them worse.

565
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,749
But...

566
00:27:03,816 --> 00:27:07,019
Maybe the problem isn't
a heavy metal from outside.

567
00:27:07,087 --> 00:27:08,488
It's inside.

568
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:10,157
But it's not leaving the body
like it's supposed to.

569
00:27:10,224 --> 00:27:12,559
It's stuck.

570
00:27:12,627 --> 00:27:14,428
Iron.

571
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,063
The donor had hemosiderosis.

572
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,931
His body wasn't disposing
of iron.

573
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:20,300
Massive amounts
choke up the lungs.

574
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:22,503
Then our chelation
would wreak havoc

575
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,837
because it picks up
too much stuff.

576
00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:25,906
Go stain the dead lung tissue
for iron.

577
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:32,146
I'm sorry, young lady,
I simply will not help you

578
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:36,917
steal this chair.

579
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:42,523
Hi.

580
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:47,027
She can barely
catch her breath.

581
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:53,466
Lungs ready yet?

582
00:27:53,534 --> 00:27:55,100
We're testing
for iron overload.

583
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:56,468
I thought it was lead.

584
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:58,737
This is not an exact process.

585
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:02,807
Your small airways
are collapsing.

586
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:06,744
You're not getting
enough oxygen.

587
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,112
I'd like to try forcing

588
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,447
an oxygen-rich slurry
into your lungs.

589
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:12,750
It should open up the airways
and buy you some time

590
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:13,684
until the lungs are ready.

591
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,723
Fluid?
In my lungs?

592
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:26,232
Sounds like drowning.

593
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:33,340
Gonna hurt,
isn't it?

594
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:37,511
Yes.
A fair amount.

595
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,518
No.

596
00:28:44,586 --> 00:28:46,687
I'm done.

597
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:54,896
[Knock at door]

598
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:56,864
<i>(Wilson) House, the nurses</i>
<i>saw you come in.</i>

599
00:28:56,932 --> 00:28:59,467
Enter.

600
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:01,269
<i>It's a bathroom.</i>

601
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:03,938
Ah, explains the hole
in this chair.

602
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:13,681
God, I missed doors.

603
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:15,550
And air freshener.

604
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:19,287
Now go away.

605
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:21,623
I'm waiting
for some test results.

606
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:23,925
My patient signed a DNR.
She's giving up.

607
00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:26,660
Looks like someone else
will be getting the lungs.

608
00:29:26,728 --> 00:29:30,564
Making this yet another
interaction with you

609
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:32,698
it's not my fault
you can't handle your patient.

610
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:35,468
She said she's done.

611
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:37,270
I spent half an hour
trying to change her mind,

612
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:38,505
but she'd made her decision.

613
00:29:38,573 --> 00:29:40,341
I accepted that.
It's called respect.

614
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:42,209
Well, what's after respect?

615
00:29:42,277 --> 00:29:44,379
<i>You find</i>
<i>another angle.</i>

616
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:45,580
<i>You hold her hand,</i>

617
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:47,616
get the sister
to beg,

618
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:48,884
stick your fingers
in your ears,

619
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:50,520
pretend you can't hear.

620
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,689
You do whatever it takes.

621
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,023
Oh, whatever it takes.

622
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:55,024
Thanks, House.

623
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:57,327
I hadn't thought
of that.

624
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:10,007
[Door opens]

625
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,142
What are you testing for?

626
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,710
Hemosiderosis.

627
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,812
I'm staining
for excess iron.

628
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,114
Promising.

629
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:20,050
When your dad showed up
unexpectedly,

630
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,251
House have a hand in that?

631
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:27,123
I'm guessing he does things
like that a lot.

632
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:31,994
I spoke to the head
of neurology in Chicago.

633
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:33,663
I gave you
a good recommendation.

634
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,498
Did you mention
what happened?

635
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:38,001
Lawyers say
I'm not allowed to.

636
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,804
It works out well
for everyone.

637
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:45,809
Why exactly
is that good for you?

638
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,344
Excuse me?

639
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,013
I'm a talented physician,
top 2% of my class.

640
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,615
I'm an asset to this hospital,

641
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,150
an asset you're about to lose
to Chicago.

642
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:54,685
You applied
for the job.

643
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,754
You asked me to call
and recommend you.

644
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:57,788
Andrews is the one
that should leave.

645
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,889
He's the supervisor.

646
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,491
He touched me first.

647
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,759
I can't discuss
any of that,

648
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:04,495
not before the hearing.

649
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,597
But if you're having doubts
about Chicago,

650
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:07,731
I can call them back.

651
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,736
No. Thank you.

652
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,275
Dr. Foreman?

653
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,477
<i>Would you look at this?</i>

654
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,679
Iron?

655
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:23,680
<i>No.</i>

656
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:26,215
<i>White blood cells.</i>

657
00:31:26,283 --> 00:31:29,217
Classic presentation
of infection.

658
00:31:29,285 --> 00:31:30,885
How the hell
did we miss that?

659
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:39,656
Biopsy revealed,
white blood cell inflitrate.

660
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:42,853
Infection was right, after all.

661
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,840
Fresh fruit in prison
is usually chicken.

662
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,241
Why aren't you
more alarmed?

663
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,375
We're running
out of time.

664
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:52,044
Aahh, she's dying!

665
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:55,680
Were you able to figure out
what was wrong

666
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:56,748
while I was screaming?

667
00:31:56,816 --> 00:31:59,184
Infection was the first thing

668
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:00,853
that the transplant team
treated for.

669
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,154
Which would have worked

670
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:03,722
if the bacteria
had been out in the open.

671
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,691
If they're hiding
inside the lung cells...

672
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,060
I'm thinking brucella.

673
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:11,064
And to wipe that out,
you need special ops.

674
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:14,201
An intact immune system.

675
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,838
But that's
what white blood cells are.

676
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:19,940
They're part
of the immune defense force,

677
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:21,409
like the infantry.

678
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:25,146
But those lungs need
the Air Force and the Marines,

679
00:32:25,214 --> 00:32:29,417
antibodies raining down
from above.

680
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:32,420
Antibiotics
and IVIG.

681
00:32:34,356 --> 00:32:37,292
Did you use metaphors
for your old team?

682
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,594
Or do you just think
I'm particularly stupid?

683
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:43,698
No,
they were stupid too.

684
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:55,709
What are you doing here?

685
00:32:55,777 --> 00:32:58,411
I'm here
for Vanessa.

686
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,347
Now is not the time,
Bobby.

687
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:02,115
She asked me
to come.

688
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:04,284
Right, Doc?

689
00:33:04,352 --> 00:33:07,387
Actually,
it was my idea.

690
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:08,990
What?
What were you thinking?

691
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:10,057
She doesn't want
to see him.

692
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,091
When Vanessa was ready
to quit chemo,

693
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:12,893
Bobby's the one

694
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:14,161
<i>who got her</i>
<i>to do one more round.</i>

695
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:16,531
Yeah,
and then he got her drunk.

696
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:22,603
At least tell me
you haven't been drinking today.

697
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:28,609
I should go.

698
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:59,306
Hail, hail,
the gang's all here.

699
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:01,974
Case is under control.

700
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,176
It's me time.

701
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,788
Vanessa's gonna do
the lung slurry.

702
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,494
You were right
to push me.

703
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,197
I needed that.
Thank you.

704
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,532
So we're good?

705
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,069
It was good advice.

706
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,505
Just came here
to say thank you.

707
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,678
I like you.

708
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,212
<i>I have fun with you.</i>

709
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,281
And, if you can honestly say

710
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:43,450
that you don't like me,

711
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:45,084
you don't have fun with me,

712
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,352
I can accept that.

713
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,121
But just do
whatever you have to do

714
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:50,256
to get over this.

715
00:34:50,323 --> 00:34:51,724
You can punch me
in the face,

716
