00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:12,373
Temporal lobe epilepsy.

181
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:14,643
<i>Causes voices, dizziness.</i>
<i>Trauma from seizure</i>

182
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,061
would explain the nose bleed.

183
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:19,547
You know about
all of my siblings

184
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,316
and cousins
and aunts and uncles and--

185
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:23,051
You're overreacting.

186
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:24,831
<i>Because you don't trust me</i>
<i>enough to tell me--</i>

187
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:25,520
Sorry.

188
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:28,990
It's time to go down
for your test.

189
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,358
If you wanna wait here,

190
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,577
it'll only take
about an hour.

191
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:34,729
No. She's leaving.

192
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,415
Derrick, come on.

193
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,783
I mean,
we should at least talk.

194
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:42,287
I'd rather
you just leave.

195
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:44,923
And you don't need
to come back.

196
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,052
Time.

197
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,987
<i>Any odd tastes or smells?</i>

198
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,256
Nope. Feel fine.

199
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:03,258
Things look fine
on my end too.

200
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:08,763
So...

201
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:11,399
you won't admit
to your doctors

202
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,034
that you're hearing
your brother's voice,

203
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:15,370
which is dangerous.

204
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:17,656
And now you lost
your girlfriend over it,

205
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,291
which is stupid.

206
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,409
I assume
there's more to the story?

207
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,278
That's how I was raised.

208
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:26,047
Short story.

209
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:27,299
[Laughs]
Yeah.

210
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,634
My boss is losing
his best friend to cancer.

211
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:33,054
And instead of talking
about the pain,

212
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:35,056
he's pretending
there is no pain

213
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:37,559
because everything
can be fixed.

214
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,684
My father
tried to deal with it.

215
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,902
Ironic that he'd drink
himself into oblivion

216
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,106
after my brother was killed
by a drunk driver.

217
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,746
Do you need a tissue?

218
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,550
After dad left,

219
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:05,203
my mom moved us away.

220
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:07,822
She got rid of all the pictures
of Christopher

221
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:09,524
and never mentioned him
again.

222
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,693
It was like
he never existed.

223
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:14,045
And that worked for us.

224
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,098
And yet, you kept one.

225
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,167
Uh, my right eye...

226
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:21,803
I was seeing spots,
but now I can't see at all.

227
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:23,855
Is that from the test?

228
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,807
No.
This is something else.

229
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,642
Aah! That hurts.

230
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:28,560
Sorry.

231
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:31,780
How many fingers?

232
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,565
Two. Fuzzy ones,
but two.

233
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,567
There's a clot in the artery
behind your eye.

234
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:37,185
I just broke it up.

235
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,870
Is that bad?

236
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:42,123
Don't know, because I don't
know why it happened.

237
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:51,299
Hey.
Saved us a table.

238
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,084
There are no tables.

239
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:56,338
I recently hacked into
your old files.

240
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,391
Found a six-year-old boy
with bilateral retinoblastoma.

241
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:00,975
Doctors wanted
to take his eyes out

242
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,877
before the cancer
spread to his brain,

243
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:04,545
and you fought them.

244
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:07,315
Advocated for a new photon
beam radiation.

245
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:10,985
Saved the kid's vision.
Probably saved his life.

246
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:13,221
That was my first case
at PPTH.

247
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:14,522
Mikey Kimble.

248
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:16,107
<i>It's Michael now.</i>

249
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,329
Oh, yeah.
This is our table.

250
00:13:21,397 --> 00:13:23,248
Wow.

251
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:25,083
I...

252
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:28,036
[Stammering]

253
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,170
How are you?

254
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:30,839
I'm doing great.

255
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:32,707
I'm graduating next month.

256
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,592
Already?

257
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:36,177
Little Mikey?

258
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:39,080
And I got accepted
to Princeton.

259
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:41,633
And I'm planning
on going to med school.

260
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,218
Oh...
[Laughing]

261
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:44,752
<i>He's going to be a doctor</i>

262
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,137
instead of being dead.

263
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:49,941
<i>Dr. House</i>

264
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:53,311
told me all about
your situation.

265
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,430
<i>That's why I came.</i>

266
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,932
<i>There's just so much good</i>
<i>that you can do,</i>

267
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,634
even in a small
amount of time.

268
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:04,706
I wonder...

269
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,042
Hey!

270
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,494
Is there anybody else here

271
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:12,613
who's alive today
because of Dr. James Wilson?

272
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:35,437
Gastric adenocarcinoma.

273
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:37,739
15 years in remission.

274
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:41,359
<i>Six grandchildren</i>
<i>that I never would have met.</i>

275
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:42,861
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

276
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:46,147
<i>Squamous cell lung cancer.</i>

277
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,483
12 years in remission.

278
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:52,036
I was able to walk my daughter
down the aisle last May.

279
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:54,205
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

280
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,884
<i>I did the math.</i>

281
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:08,019
74 children are alive today

282
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:10,505
because of you.

283
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:12,774
14 grandchildren.

284
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:18,313
Mikey Kimble
started kindergarten

285
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:21,182
before the age cutoff.

286
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:25,854
He would have graduated
high school last year.

287
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:30,041
I flunked a year.

288
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,377
Was anybody in this room

289
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,546
really a patient of mine?

290
00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:41,869
They're somewhere.

291
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:46,040
They're giving you
a standing "O" somewhere.

292
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:48,426
They exist.
You saved their lives.

293
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:52,213
Actually, more impressive--
they're too busy to be here.

294
00:15:57,686 --> 00:15:59,354
What's this?

295
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,939
A glowing letter
of recommendation

296
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,241
you just wrote for me
on my laptop.

297
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:05,527
I notice it's lacking
your signature at the bottom.

298
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,028
Don't you think you're being
a bit premature

299
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,279
predicting House's demise?

300
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,331
Not demise.
Just implosion.

301
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,568
He's going through
a rough time,

302
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:15,870
but so far,
he's been handling it--

303
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:19,073
[water gurgling]

304
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:27,782
(Foreman)
House.

305
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,253
Your shoes are wet!

306
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:33,805
Glad to see
your emotional turmoil

307
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:36,057
hasn't dulled your powers
of observation.

308
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:38,476
I know you're responsible.

309
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:41,646
No, you don't.
'Cause I didn't do it.

310
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,765
Whatever <i>it</i> is.

311
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:45,766
But if I had shoved
those season tickets

312
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:47,435
down some toilets,

313
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:50,121
I would have done it
because you asked me to.

314
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:51,656
You wanted to replace Wilson.

315
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,458
I prank Wilson all the time.

316
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,792
Enjoy.

317
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,946
I got you three,
but I drank them.

318
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:24,521
You didn't have to
call me,

319
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:26,607
but I appreciate
I made the list.

320
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,725
It wasn't entirely
unselfish.

321
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:37,618
I didn't feel right

322
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,903
approaching any
of my terminal patients,

323
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:43,157
<i>but...</i>

324
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,412
What is it like?

325
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:50,297
Hmm...

326
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:53,533
Does it ever stop
being surreal?

327
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,889
It'll stop in about...

328
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:01,875
five or six months,
give or take, in your case.

329
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,145
[Chuckles]

330
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:07,397
You know what happened
to me today?

331
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:11,018
One of my patients
suddenly started crying.

332
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:13,153
It can't be your first.

333
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:16,990
The first one...
who was crying for me.

334
00:18:19,227 --> 00:18:21,495
It's the human response.

335
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,247
It's either
overly saccharine,

336
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:25,499
because giving sympathy
makes them feel better,

337
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,117
<i>or they ignore you,</i>

338
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:30,170
because hiding from mortality
makes them feel better.

339
00:18:30,238 --> 00:18:31,872
Why can't they just
say something

340
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:33,440
that makes <i>me</i>
feel better?

341
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:35,843
Like what, exactly?

342
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,929
[Silently]

343
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:40,848
[Laughing]

344
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:41,932
I don't know.

345
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:43,433
<i>No.</i>

346
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:51,475
You'd be doing what,
two weeks on, two weeks off?

347
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,110
So maybe do your first round,
see how it goes.

348
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:56,113
<i>Maybe not as horrible</i>
<i>as you fear.</i>

349
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:58,949
Then do the second round,
enjoy your two weeks off,

350
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,951
and revisit the decision.

351
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:02,269
Rinse, repeat.

352
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,327
I just can't envision
spending my remaining time

353
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,546
in a chemo suite
in Princeton.

354
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,785
I want to...

355
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:21,171
enjoy myself
with family and friends.

356
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:25,959
Friends or friend?

357
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,430
Hi, this is Greg House.
Again.

358
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:32,482
Third message,
hopefully indicating

359
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,801
how much I want you
to call me back.

360
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:37,470
I'd say that your son is dying
to increase the urgency,

361
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:40,991
but you probably
already know that.

362
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:42,409
The fake people who care

363
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,111
that Wilson stays alive
didn't work,

364
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,280
so I need the real people
who care about him

365
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:48,081
to tell him what an idiot
he's being.

366
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:49,283
Where are we going?

367
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,368
I just got paged
to go to the bathroom.

368
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,620
I don't know where
the rest of you are going.

369
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:56,323
Some of our patient's symptoms
might be physiological,

370
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:57,874
and some might be
psychological.

371
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,659
You think being forced
to bury painful memories

372
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:01,178
is making symptoms worse?

373
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:03,847
Grief avoidance can lead to
all sorts of anxiety disorders,

374
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:08,468
which can manifest
into physical illness.

375
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:13,340
Let's assume...that all his
symptoms are real symptoms.

376
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:16,226
So we're going to avoid
grief avoidance?

377
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:17,694
Studies after
September 11th showed

378
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:19,512
that repression was actually
better for coping

379
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:21,148
than dwelling in misery.

380
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,983
<i>What about</i>
<i>polycythemia vera?</i>

381
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:25,185
(Adams) RBCs are slightly
elevated, but not that much.

382
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:26,703
(Taub)
Hodgkin's lymphoma?

383
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:28,739
(Park) Would have showed up
in the PET scan.

384
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:30,540
What if your guy
got hurt at practice?

385
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,543
And, like everything else,
just didn't tell anyone.

386
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:36,863
Could have set off DIC,
would explain everything.

387
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:38,548
I thought you had
to go to the bathroom.

388
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,300
I didn't say
I had to go in.

389
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:43,136
Need some more mops
in here!

390
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:50,210
What exactly
are you looking for?

391
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:54,081
Blood. If your spinal fluid
is yellow instead of clear,

392
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,083
<i>it means you've had</i>
<i>a subarachnoid hemorrhage.</i>

393
00:20:58,786 --> 00:21:01,738
What does your brother
say to you?

394
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,440
Does he tell you
you're gonna be okay?

395
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:08,445
Doesn't really
work like that.

396
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:12,232
I think you hear your brother's
voice for a reason.

397
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,900
Thought you guys said
that I hear things

398
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,402
because I'm sick.
Yes.

399
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:17,704
But that doesn't explain why you
don't hear a different voice.

400
00:21:17,772 --> 00:21:20,240
I think your mom
didn't let you

401
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:22,609
deal with the grief
of losing your brother properly.

402
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:25,679
<i>There are people here</i>

403
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:27,914
who could help you
with that.

404
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:32,519
Okay.

405
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,277
The opening pressure's
way too high.

406
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:03,583
The prodigal daughter returns.

407
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:07,471
You taking me up on my offer
to off you?

408
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:09,806
Think I've still got
some leftover propofol.

409
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:12,008
Spoke to Wilson.

410
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:16,012
He's angry because
I want him to live longer.

411
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:17,597
Who wouldn't be?

412
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,149
Friends respect
each other's decisions,

413
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:21,017
even if they don't
agree with them.

414
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:22,302
It's called loyalty.

415
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,687
Loyalty is a tool

416
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:25,839
to get people to do things
they don't wanna do.

417
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:30,360
But you do want to.

418
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:33,997
You may have rationalized it
a hundred different ways,

419
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:37,000
but the fact is, you fired me
so that I'd be forced

420
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,452
to spend the rest of my life

421
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:42,022
doing exactly
what I wanted to do.

422
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,925
It was probably
the most...

423
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,461
selfless thing anyone
has ever done for me.

424
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:52,599
And you don't even
like me that much.

425
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:03,276
[Door opens]

426
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:07,847
I surrender.

427
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:20,160
I have been a disloyal...

428
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:23,029
disrespectful jerk.

429
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,198
I should have listened
to what you wanted.

430
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:28,635
I'm still not letting
my parents return your call.

431
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:31,338
I made a reservation for two
at Carmine's.

432
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:34,007
Tonight. 8:00.

433
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:37,344
No more tricks.
No more manipulations.

434
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,396
Said Machiavelli.

435
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,765
<i>Just...</i>

436
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:45,051
two friends enjoying
the time they have left.

437
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:46,686
Please, don't--

438
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,071
I'm not.
I promise.

439
00:23:50,858 --> 00:23:52,659
Just dinner?

440
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:55,395
That depends on how much
you have to drink.

441
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,834
That sounds nice.

442
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,494
Mom.

443
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:12,546
I came as soon
as I got your message.

444
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:14,164
Is he gonna be okay?
We're hoping it's just

445
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:16,967
excess fluid on his brain
from an extreme migraine,

446
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:19,636
<i>which isn't good,</i>
<i>but it's treatable.</i>

447
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:21,254
He's scheduled
to get an MRI

448
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:23,623
as soon as these meds
start taking effect.

449
00:24:28,813 --> 00:24:32,566
We found that picture
in his dorm room.

450
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:37,604
I'm not sure
what Derrick's told you, but...

451
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:41,307
He's been hearing Christopher's
voice for the last ten years.

452
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,177
<i>And it's possible</i>
<i>that repressing</i>

453
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:45,979
<i>all that grief he's felt</i>

454
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,648
<i>is actually causing</i>
<i>some of Derrick's symptoms.</i>

455
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:53,153
I don't even know
if this voice in my head

456
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:54,621
is something I invented

457
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:56,590
or if it's what Christopher
was really like.

458
00:24:56,657 --> 00:25:00,844
With no photos, no video...

459
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,847
my memories...

460
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:07,200
I really don't
have any anymore.

461
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:13,340
Maybe you could just...

462
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:16,676
tell me a little bit
about him?

463
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:22,566
I'm sorry.
It was a long drive in.

464
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:26,236
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

465
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:28,572
Okay.

466
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,864
[Laughs]
97 years old,

467
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:39,883
and you told her
she was pregnant.

468
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:41,418
[Both chuckling]

469
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:42,886
Well, it cured
her hiccups.

470
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,038
[Wilson laughing]

471
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:48,008
I didn't expect her
to cry for quite so long.

472
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,542
[Laughing]

473
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:53,063
Now, I know that
the tiramisu is great here,

474
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:55,482
but I actually ordered
off-menu.

475
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:06,159
Great.

476
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:08,862
I told you, you didn't hang
the bear bag high enough.

477
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:10,781
It was a smart bear.

478
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:13,066
I'm almost certain
he untied my knots.

479
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:14,951
Well, he wasn't that smart.
He left the oreos behind.

480
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:18,171
You hiked
for 32 miles

481
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,874
eating nothing
but creamy filling.

482
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:24,344
The black stuff
is overrated.

483
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:26,797
To climbing the hill.

484
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:35,388
Okay.

485
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,358
If I did decide to...

486
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:40,310
stick around
a little longer--

487
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:41,695
Don't do that to me,
Wilson.

488
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:44,531
No, I'm not, I'm just--

489
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,868
I do feel pretty good
and I...

490
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:50,504
Maybe I should try it

491
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:52,622
for a little while.

492
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:56,209
Well, I...

493
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:58,745
I think
that's reasonable.

494
00:27:08,756 --> 00:27:10,674
Are you c-conning me?

495
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,179
You're conning me.

496
00:27:16,264 --> 00:27:17,597
Wha--

497
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:19,465
just because you folded,

498
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:22,068
that means it must be
some evil plan?

499
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:25,355
Well, that's usually
how it works with you.

500
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:27,274
You drown me in nostalgia

501
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:28,992
so I'll think about
our friendship

502
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:32,412
and feel some kind of loyalty
and agree to more chemo!

503
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,830
That was real nostalgia.

504
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:35,448
It was real emotions,
a real decision.

505
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,835
A decision
that I just made for you!

506
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,171
[Sighs]

507
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:49,462
I need you, okay?

508
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,899
I want you to be around
as long as possible.

509
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,601
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

510
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:55,802
No. No.

511
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,053
Don't do that.

512
00:27:58,306 --> 00:28:00,774
I don't owe you anything.

513
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:04,144
Our entire relationship
has been about you.

514
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:06,062
My dying is about me.

515
00:28:24,215 --> 00:28:26,666
[Sobbing]

516
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,448
Look at you.
You don't wanna die.

517
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:00,450
Of course,
I don't wanna die!

518
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:01,785
Well, then fight.

519
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:03,536
I did! I tried.

520
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:04,921
One time.

521
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:06,339
House, get out
of my car.

522
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:08,074
You don't have to
just accept this.

523
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,843
Yes, I do have to
accept this.

524
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,411
I have five months
to live,

525
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:15,248
and you're making me
go through this alone!

526
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,474
I'm pissed because I'm dying,
and it's not fair.

527
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,644
And I need...

528
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:29,479
I need a friend.

529
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:31,648
I need to know
that you're there.

530
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,600
I need--

531
00:29:35,703 --> 00:29:38,655
I need you to tell me
that my life...

532
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:43,126
was worthwhile,
and I...

533
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,912
I need you to tell me
that you love me.

534
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,590

trash you want me to do.

716
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:23,250
House...I tried
to keep this internal.

717
00:42:23,317 --> 00:42:27,037
<i>The fire department handed</i>
<i>the tickets to the police</i>

718
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:29,256
who contacted
your parole officer.

719
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:32,042
<i>It's felony vandalism.</i>

720
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:34,094
<i>He's gonna revoke your parole.</i>

721
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:36,213
There's nothing we can do.

722
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:38,164
You have to report
to Mercer County Jail on Monday

723
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:39,883
to serve out the rest
of your sentence.

724
00:42:47,392 --> 00:42:49,893
And that's...
that's how long?

725
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:52,512
I'm sorry.

726
00:42:52,563 --> 00:42:54,531
How long?

727
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,989
Six months.
