2
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:21,420
You okay?

3
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:22,422
Yeah, just got clipped
with a beam.

4
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:23,967
What the hell do you two think
you were doing?

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,177
We thought we
heard someone in there!

6
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,889
You never go in
without authorization!

7
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:28,894
Captain, this is all me.
Amy just followed me in.

8
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:31,399
So torching your ass last year
wasn't enough, huh?

9
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:35,699
You need to stop trying to
prove how tough you are before
you get yourself killed.

10
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:37,035
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,585
Let the paramedics
look you over.

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,685
Come on, Derek.
Let's get this ladder to
the second story. Let's go.

00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,741
(GASPING)

14
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,958
Derek! Derek!

15
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,484
Derek!

16
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:36,910
What's happening?

17
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:39,749
I'm freezing.

18
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:15,491
I'm fine.

19
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:16,701
ER docs don't think so.

20
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:19,791
Your temperature's
been going up and down
like a rollercoaster.

21
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,712
How old are these skin grafts?

22
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:24,217
Last one was
about six months ago.

23
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:28,434
We're gonna run some tests
and we'll get a consult
with Dr. House.

24
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:29,603
I'll be fine.

25
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:32,484
You'll be doing
what the doctors say. Got it?

26
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,282
I'll check in later.

27
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,332
Hey.

28
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:44,175
The way you
covered for me last night...

29
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:45,804
He's my brother.

30
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:48,017
I know how to eat it from him.

31
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,190
I'm gonna stop by
after my shift, okay?

32
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:52,401
Okay.

33
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:55,532
So where is this Dr. House?

34
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,622
Speaking engagement.

35
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:02,088
Not guilty.

36
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:05,720
And on the charge of gaining
control of said medication
by fraud, how do you plead?

37
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:07,432
Not guilty.
Very well.

38
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:11,399
Preliminary hearing is set for
the 19th at 10:00 a.m.,

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,198
at which time I'll determine
whether there's enough
evidence to proceed to trial.

40
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:18,580
Next case on the calendar.
People versus Williams.

41
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,334
Charge is assault
in the second degree

42
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:22,129
with intent to cause injury
to another person.

43
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:25,219
I see the defense has
submitted a motion
to dismiss...

44
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:28,768
You gonna go talk to him?

45
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:31,232
I was just gonna ask him
where he gets his hair cut.

46
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:36,451
They have your signature
in the prescription log,
a security camera video,

47
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:40,585
and a pharmacist's sworn
statement saying you stole
a dead guy's pills.

48
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:42,213
You're already looking
at 10 years.

49
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,969
You wanna add
a witness intimidation charge?

50
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,683
Go ahead, ask him
about his hair.

51
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:55,699
He suffered third-degree burns
over 54% of his body,
a year ago,

52
00:03:55,783 --> 00:03:58,330
and arrived in
the ER last night,
disoriented and shivering.

53
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:01,587
For 12 hours his temperature
was bouncing between
96 and 102.

54
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:03,800
Why don't you contest
the search of
the pharmacy records?

55
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:06,555
Yeah. You could argue it
violated doctor-patient
confidentiality.

56
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,142
Except he wasn't the patient
or the doctor.

57
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:11,190
He was the guy who stole
from the patient
and the doctor!

58
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:13,653
This was the third time he'd
been disoriented
in the last two weeks.

59
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:18,121
Running into smoke-filled
burning buildings
can be a bit disorienting.

60
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:20,501
Fortunately, I have the cure.
Stop doing it.

61
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:22,923
He's not in
a burning building anymore,
and he's still shivering.

62
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:25,136
A hypothalamic tumor
could cause
a vacillating temperature.

63
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:27,307
So could ER nurses
who were too busy to notice

64
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,605
that a patient likes
both hot coffee
and cold sodas.

65
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:37,370
He tested negative for Hep C,
TB, HIV, Lyme,
and his tox screen's clean.

66
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,714
In case you hadn't noticed,
not exactly
in the mood to dance.

67
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,595
I'm not asking you to dance.
I'm asking you to do your job.

68
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:55,157
EKG showed arrhythmia.
Probably just
a mild heart attack.

69
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,664
No chest pain.
And smoke inhalation already
explains the arrhythmia.

70
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:01,879
The guy was in the burn unit
for six months
and had multiple surgeries.

71
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:04,301
Could be a hospital-acquired
infection. Maybe MRSA.

72
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:06,221
Works for me.

73
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,058
Draw a blood culture,
start him on antibiotics,

74
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,981
vancomycin plus broad
gram-negative coverage.

75
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:20,000
If you called to see
the design for my prison tats,
they're still in R and D.

76
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,795
You need to talk to Tritter.

77
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,173
Not according to my lawyer.

78
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:26,138
Your lawyer isn't gonna be
able to get the DA to drop
the case. Tritter can.

79
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:28,392
Yeah, you know what else
Tritter can do?

80
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:30,564
You are not impressing anyone!

81
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:31,900
You may call yourself
principled,

82
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:35,198
but what you really are
is a stubborn
adolescent idiot!

83
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:36,994
This isn't his fault!
I'm not the one who...

84
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:39,332
You used the
rectal thermometer on him.

85
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,879
You insulted him
instead of apologizing.

86
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:46,388
You flaunted your drug use
in his face and you refused
to accept a deal...

87
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:47,933
I accepted the deal!

88
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:51,106
Not until after
you stole a dead guy's pills!

89
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,234
Allegedly.

90
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,948
Tritter has been opening doors
for you every step of the way

91
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,202
and you keep
slamming them shut.

92
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:59,582
There are no more openings
to give, House.

93
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:03,299
If you wanna stay out of
prison, you got to make
one for yourself.

94
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:12,192
It's Vicodin.
You function better on it.
Talk to him.

95
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:22,004
MRSA's a bacteria
that often infects
hospital patients.

96
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:26,764
The burns on your chest
and arm exposed raw flesh that
made you a wide-open target.

97
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:28,810
But the antibiotics
would take care of it, right?

98
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:30,898
Depends on what strain it is.

99
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:33,319
We'll know more
once we get the results back
from these cultures.

100
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:36,200
So this MRSA thing,

101
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,376
would it make everything
look blue?

102
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:46,096
He's seeing blue.

103
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:48,685
Who'd you get the scrip from?

104
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:51,357
Cuddy. You wanna know
what I gave her?

105
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,027
MRSA wouldn't change
his ocular palette.

106
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:56,242
Heavy metal poisoning
could cause vision changes,
particularly thallium.

107
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:58,163
If it was thallium,
he'd be losing his hair.

108
00:06:58,205 --> 00:06:59,916
So maybe it's menopause.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,088
He's 28 years old.

110
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,386
Yes, his age is the reason
it's weird that a man
has menopause.

111
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,518
Male menopause.
High estrogen,
low testosterone.

112
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,981
Explains the temperature
swings, disorientation,

113
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:13,695
endocrinologically similar
to female menopause,

114
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:15,699
but without the vaginas
and the mahjong tiles.

115
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:17,954
Male menopause doesn't explain
the blue vision.

116
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,587
Blue vision isn't a symptom.
It's a side effect of Viagra.

117
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,839
It's right there on the label,

118
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:25,511
which I'd had
no reason to have read,
except that I'm a doctor.

119
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:27,808
He's not taking Viagra.

120
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,021
You mean he didn't tell you
he was taking Viagra.

121
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:33,278
I don't care how sick he is.
Trust me, he still thinks
he's got a shot.

122
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:36,618
Menopause causes temperature
swings, limpness,
limpness causes pills,

123
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:37,745
pills cause the blues.

124
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,833
He's presenting no other signs
of premature aging.

125
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,127
Aging's not the only cause.

126
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,050
You said that he's got
burns on 54% of his body.

127
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:46,722
Sure it's not 55%?

128
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:48,935
Burns to his genitals could
cause testicular trauma.

129
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:51,232
Which could in turn cause...

130
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:53,236
Run a hormone panel.

131
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,451
When it comes back positive,
pump him full of testosterone
and send him home.

132
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:58,163
Stop following me!

133
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,549
Thank God my parents are dead.

134
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,973
If the old man had heard
I had menopause,
I'd never live it down.

135
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:08,643
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

136
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:11,816
Once these testosterone
pellets dissolve, your system
will be back to normal.

137
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,154
Yeah, but until then
I'm an old lady.

138
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:17,286
Okay to come in?

139
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:20,167
It's not MRSA.
He's not being
isolated anymore.

140
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:23,466
Anyone not in a white coat
is welcome.

141
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:26,388
You're looking better.
How you feeling?

142
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,933
I'm good.

143
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:32,359
It turns out I got some
hormone thing.
They're fixing it right now.

144
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:33,904
(GRUNTS)

145
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,075
Are you okay?

146
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,954
Yeah, I think so, I just...

147
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:39,833
Derek, are you in pain?

148
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:42,046
You need to get these out!
Okay, hold on, what's wrong?

149
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,173
DEREK: Get these out!
What's going on?

150
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,802
Looks like
an allergic reaction.

151
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:46,848
Hold on! We're going to get
you something to stop it.

152
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,017
It's okay.
No, just take them out!

153
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,770
But you've got to calm down.
It's okay.
Get them out!

154
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:51,315
Derek!
Get them out!

155
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:52,777
Derek, let her go!

156
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,405
Derek, let her go!

157
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,701
Two milligrams
of IV lorazepam, stat!

158
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,165
Get them out!

159
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,238
The complaint department
is across the hall.

160
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:22,088
I'm busy.

161
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:25,136
Can I just assume
that you told me
how unfair I'm being and...

162
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:26,514
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:35,115
You could throw a dart
at all the adjectives between
arrogant and unhinged,

164
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:37,954
and I'm sure you'd hit one
that describes me.

165
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:41,712
There's a reason
I operate that way.

166
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,845
I live in pain.

167
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:50,188
Pain that on good days
is merely intolerable.

168
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,695
And on bad ones
will suck the life force
right out of you.

169
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,662
It doesn't mean that
I've handled this right.

170
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:02,589
Actually,
it means I was wrong.

171
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,309
Thank you.

172
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:13,737
I know that couldn't have
been easy for you to say.

173
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:18,956
Even if you don't mean
a word of it.

174
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:23,006
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,720
Look, you can hook me up
to a damn polygraph...

176
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,683
And I'm sure you'd pass.

177
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:32,526
The thing is I've
never been interested
in what you have to say.

178
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:36,117
All I care about
is what you do.

179
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,582
I'll see you at the hearing.

180
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:47,140
FOREMAN: It wasn't
the medicine.

181
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,770
Contamination
and allergy tests
both came back negative.

182
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:52,192
There was nothing to suggest
a pulmonary embolism.

183
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:56,409
And his EKG showed the
expected tachycardia from
the exertion of the attack.

184
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:01,127
And I'm fine, by the way,
thanks for asking.

185
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:04,384
Aggression comes on that fast
has got to have
a neurological basis.

186
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:08,392
We should do a CT for
a frontal lobe tumor
and an LP for meningitis.

187
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:13,361
Great. Have at it.

188
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,382
That's it?
No challenging our theory,
no tearing us down?

189
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:26,013
No need.
You got it under control.

190
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:27,056
Where are you going?

191
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,768
Upstairs this time.

192
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:31,273
To do what?

193
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:35,324
Check myself into rehab.

194
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:44,509
CUDDY: Did Tritter offer you
another deal?

195
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:47,098
Nope. This is all me.

196
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:52,025
So, no slaps on the back?
Encouraging words?

197
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,739
We're just trying to
understand what this is.

198
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:57,328
I hope it's me detoxing,

199
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:01,127
otherwise I soiled a perfectly
good pair of underwear
last night for nothing.

200
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:03,299
So this is for real?

201
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,094
It's not just a show
for Tritter?

202
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:08,017
Absolutely it's
a show for Tritter.
And the judge.

203
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,190
And, unfortunately,
unless it's real,
there is no show.

204
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,944
Hey, if it doesn't
help my case,

205
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:15,658
at least I can go to prison
with heightened senses.

206
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:18,288
All the better to enjoy
my strolls around the yard.

207
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,376
Time's up. Group's starting.

208
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:25,136
Gonna need to
check that stuff.

209
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,891
When I lead
the big patient rebellion,

210
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:30,063
Voldemort here
is the first to go.

211
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:32,150
CT was normal,
no frontal lobe tumor,

212
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:33,820
LP was negative
for meningitis.

213
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:35,825
We're back to square one.

214
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:38,580
What about something vascular?
Polyarteritis nodosa?

215
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:41,127
Brain lesions would have
shown up on the CT.

216
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:43,090
Legionnaire's explains
the chills and temperature.

217
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:44,969
Altered mental status
causes the aggression.

218
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:47,641
We would have seen
respiratory problems.

219
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:50,230
We're throwing darts.
We need to go to House.

220
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:51,983
We need to
deal with this ourselves.

221
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:54,614
He can make the time!
Derek's still his patient.

222
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:56,367
The man's life as he knows it
could be over.

223
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:59,165
I think you of all people
would want to
cut him some slack.

224
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:02,630
We're treating a man who runs
into burning buildings
for perfect strangers.

225
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,511
He didn't ask for what's
happening to him. House did
everything to himself.

226
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:06,973
He's been cut more
than enough slack.

227
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:10,355
Right now, House has more
important things to deal with.

228
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:13,278
WOMAN: It was the first time
I'd seen him in months.

229
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:17,871
I guess I was hoping he'd
put his arms around me
and tell me he understood.

230
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,046
But he said he wasn't
ready to forgive me.

231
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:23,716
Well, he may never be ready.

232
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:27,056
You're doing the only thing
you can do. You're trying.

233
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,102
How about you, Greg?

234
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:31,691
Have you thought about how to
fix things with people
in your life?

235
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,152
No need.

236
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:37,202
The people in my life
have no expectations of me.

237
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:38,914
Makes all our lives easier.

238
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,083
Apparently not.

239
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,630
The first step in recovery...

240
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:43,925
Is admitting I have a problem.

241
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,138
I've obviously done that
or I wouldn't be here.

242
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:49,770
I've even embraced step two
and accepted that
there is a higher power.

243
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:54,447
Maybe not a god per se,
but that André the Giant guy
was powerful.

244
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:57,829
Where I start to butt up
against it is step three,

245
00:13:57,912 --> 00:14:00,459
surrendering my will
to this higher power.

246
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:04,718
I'm sure André's ghost
has my back and all,
but my free will,

247
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,305
I never leave home without it.

248
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,309
Kind of like your pills.

249
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:12,276
If you could do this
on your own,
I assume you wouldn't be here.

250
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:17,035
True.

251
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,854
Everybody lies.
His tox screen.

252
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,232
It's been clean every time.

253
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:33,069
Exactly. It shouldn't be.

254
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:35,449
He's had extensive
skin grafts,
which hurt like hell.

255
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:37,954
Not everybody's House.
People can handle pain
without medication.

256
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:39,374
But they do have pain.

257
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:42,296
This guy's worried about
losing his job,
so he's hiding the pain.

258
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,344
We find out where the pain is,
maybe we find out
what the problem is.

259
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,806
Or he doesn't feel pain.

260
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,685
Either way, it's something.

261
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,438
(PAGERS BEEPING)

262
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:57,369
When?
Two minutes ago.

263
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:59,290
Pulse is 157, respiration 42.

264
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:00,919
He was fine.
He was just telling me a joke,

265
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:02,630
just a minute ago...
Get her out of here!

266
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:04,259
No fluid in his lungs!

267
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:06,681
O2 stat's 85. He's hypoxic!
We're gonna have to intubate!

268
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:09,729
It's not his lungs!
He's got marked ST elevation.

269
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,816
He's having a heart attack.

270
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,881
Pick a color.

271
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,553
Medication time.

272
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:32,443
"You are a ray of sunshine
on a cloudy day."

273
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:46,388
He's stable.

274
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:47,516
Won't stay that way.

275
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,438
His blood tests showed
troponins and CK-MB up.

276
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:53,361
Chase was right.
He was hiding chest pain.

277
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,532
He's been having
a whole series
of heart attacks.

278
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:57,411
Heart attacks can't cause you
to reach out
and choke someone.

279
00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:59,541
Lack of oxygen to the brain
causes disorientation.

280
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,127
Increased adrenaline
causes rage.

281
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,509
The more important question is
what caused the attacks?

282
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:10,856
Where are you going?
To see House.

283
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:13,570
We have a 28-year-old
with clean arteries,
no valvular abnormalities

284
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:14,656
having multiple heart attacks.

285
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:17,537
I'm not gonna wait
for Chase to give us
another breakthrough.

286
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,514
Maybe we should go.

287
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:27,975
We don't have an answer yet.

288
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:30,355
I'm fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking!

289
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:33,570
Whoever came up with
buprenorphine to wean off
Vicodin should be shot.

290
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:35,491
Then stabbed in the eye.

291
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:37,745
I think someone
needs to adjust my meds!

292
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,499
The heart shows no signs
of inflammation or...

293
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,255
If the cause of the
heart attacks isn't internal,
it must be external.

294
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:43,382
Something environmental.

295
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:45,804
None of the attacks happened
in the same place.

296
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,140
Still must be something
in common.

297
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:48,852
First one happened
in an apartment building fire.

298
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:50,564
Fire, water, smoke,
oxygen masks...

299
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,192
The second and third ones
happened here.

300
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:53,486
There was no fire,
no water, no smoke.

301
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,658
His clothes
were all different,
he'd been cleaned.

302
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:58,372
That's the "whats".
How about the "whos"?

303
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,250
His partner Amy was
at all three attacks, but...

304
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:01,503
Anyone else?

305
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,424
People don't
cause heart attacks.

306
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:06,430
Well, then you shouldn't
be worried about
proving me wrong.

307
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:15,783
Amy? Would you come with me,
please?

308
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,662
Anything new on my brother?

309
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,083
We're not quite sure yet.
Could you come with me?

310
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,294
Yeah.

311
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:35,031
What's this all about?

312
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,537
I don't know.

313
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,501
They wanted to
talk to us together.

314
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,046
Derek!

315
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,395
House was right.

316
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,202
AMY: I don't get it.

317
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,457
How can I be causing
his heart attacks?

318
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,670
You may be carrying an agent
that triggered them.

319
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:04,676
It could be anything,
mold spores,
poisonous plant residue,

320
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,639
something you picked up
at a fire site.

321
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:10,230
Until we identify the agent,
we can't allow you near Derek.

322
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:14,823
I can't believe that
I'm doing this to him.

323
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,119
You can't blame yourself
for this.

324
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:19,165
You know how he got
those skin grafts?

325
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:21,086
He was trapped in a fire.

326
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:24,509
We were clearing rooms
in an office building fire.

327
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:29,478
And the ceiling collapsed,
and it cut me off
from the rest of the group.

328
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:32,234
And I kept yelling
that I was fine,

329
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:35,699
but Derek refused
to wait for the team
to clear the debris,

330
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:38,956
so he took off looking for
another access point.

331
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,589
He got caught in a backdraft.

332
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:48,142
He almost died
because of me once.

333
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:51,440
And now it's happening again.

334
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:13,737
You're not my mom.
You don't have to
keep checking up on me.

335
00:19:16,284 --> 00:19:17,704
How you doing?

336
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:19,165
Not bad,

337
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:21,921
considering I've just learned
I'm completely powerless.

338
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:24,885
See this big fancy wing?

339
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:27,766
It was built because
this program works.

340
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,102
Faulty logic.

341
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:33,152
This big fancy wing exists
because some people with money
think that it works,

342
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:36,075
wanna believe that
they can buy a better world.

343
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,626
This is nothing short of
idealized despair.
Let other people wallow in it.

344
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,589
I don't even know
what that means.

345
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:44,760
None of this means anything.

346
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:47,223
It's just nonsensical slogans
and platitudes.

347
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:49,645
Meaning takes time,
it takes work.

348
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:50,689
What do you think
I've been doing?

349
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,154
You've been here for two days!
Talk about wallowing in it!

350
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:56,701
We all get it.
We know how much pain
you have.

351
00:19:56,785 --> 00:19:59,040
You're here to deal with that
and get on with your life!

352
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:03,424
Right! I should have an affair
with a dying patient
and move into a hotel.

353
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:08,017
You're a coward, House.

354
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:12,860
You find fault in everybody
because you're afraid
to look at yourself.

355
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,163
Thanks. I was running short
on platitudes.
You can leave now.

356
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:29,729
We tested Amy for about
a dozen different agents, but
they all came back negative.

357
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,150
So she's not causing
the attacks.

358
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:36,451
Derek, are you
in love with her?

359
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,499
What does that have to do
with anything?

360
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,879
Amy told me how
you got those skin grafts.

361
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:46,054
And the way you're always
watching out for her, and I
see the way you look at her.

362
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,403
Have you told her
how you feel?

363
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:57,453
She has a six-year-old
daughter.

364
00:20:57,536 --> 00:21:00,334
Women with daughters
can still fall in love.

365
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,800
I know.

366
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:07,975
Because she did.
With my brother.

367
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,443
They're engaged.

368
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:18,873
Broken heart syndrome.
He's in love
and it's killing him.

369
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:21,002
I thought that only happened
to 80-year-old widows.

370
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:23,925
Thanks to his menopause
and estrogen level,
he basically is an old woman.

371
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:27,223
BHS is an acute physical
response to
an emotional experience.

372
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,228
Stress triggers
a flood of catecholamines...

373
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:32,610
That's a plain old stress
cardiomyopathy,
not a heart attack.

374
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,864
But if you're too worried
about losing your job
to get it treated,

375
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:37,202
they can devolve
into full-on heart attacks.

376
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:39,791
You think it's
a coincidence this started
when Amy got engaged?

377
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,587
No, I don't.

378
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,215
But now that you
know the "why",

379
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:44,718
what are you gonna do
to stop the "how"?

380
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:47,641
I already put him
on beta-blockers
and nitroglycerin. No effect.

381
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,144
We need to put him
on antidepressants.

382
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:50,522
Not if you're right.

383
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,860
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

384
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,572
which would only speed up
the heart attacks.

385
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:57,912
We could try propylthiouracil,
slow down his metabolic rate.

386
00:21:57,996 --> 00:22:00,501
Thyroid effect would
only weaken the heart.

387
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:02,505
The only other option
is blood thinners.

388
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:06,054
This is not a fat guy
with plaque-filled arteries
and a swollen heart.

389
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,142
He's a guy whose brain
is trying to kill his heart.

390
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:11,023
So buy him a girlfriend,
make him happy.

391
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:12,568
That might make you happy.

392
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,530
The only thing that'll
make him happy is Amy.

393
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:16,159
So keep him away from her.

394
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:18,539
He has a myocardial infarction
every time she walks
in the room.

395
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:19,582
What do you think will happen
to his heart

396
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:20,793
when we tell him
he can never see her again?

397
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:22,380
CHASE: He needs a shrink.

398
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:24,301
Chase's idea
is as good as any.

399
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:28,100
But short of frying his brain
and wiping Amy out,
he's screwed.

400
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,862
We need Cuddy.

401
00:22:33,946 --> 00:22:34,948
Why?

402
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:37,996
So you can tell her
why you need to
fry a guy's brain.

403
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:42,923
The guy's heart isn't working
and you want to
shock his brain.

404
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:45,971
Electroshock therapy is
the only way to erase
his memories of Amy

405
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:47,850
and stop the brain's
chemical attack on the heart.

406
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,395
This isn't 1940!

407
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:51,482
The problem can be controlled
with antidepressants.

408
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:52,484
Cameron?

409
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:54,781
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

410
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:56,033
speed up the attacks.

411
00:22:56,075 --> 00:23:00,501
LMNO, PTU, blood thinners,
none of them
will solve this problem.

412
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:03,633
The man's got a real-life
Harlequin Romance in his head.

413
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,388
We're gonna pull out
the 1940 playbook.

414
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:10,689
Bilateral electrodes,
high-stimulus
sine-wave intensity,

415
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:12,902
turning that dial
all the way to 11.

416
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:13,946
It's basic brain chemistry.

417
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:16,701
We interrupt
protein synthesis, altering
the neurotransmitter system.

418
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:20,000
End result, no memories,
no Amy, no problem.

419
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:28,935
Go ahead.

420
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:33,278
You heard the lady,
go plug him in.

421
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,879
Am I really that pathetic?

422
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:45,344
What are you talking about?

423
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:47,683
If I had pitched
electroshock therapy

424
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:51,190
as a cure for
broken heart syndrome
any other time,

425
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:54,823
you'd have dug in,
made me try a hundred other
useless things first.

426
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:57,035
So either you're actually
beginning to trust me

427
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,042
or you just feel sorry for me.

428
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:03,841
You presented
a reasonable argument.

429
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:06,639
You were clear-headed
and non-impulsive about it.

430
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:09,060
Never once
used the word "moron."

431
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:12,860
The rehab's working, House.

432
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:18,497
CAMERON: You'll still be
able to perform
routine functions

433
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,086
like walking, talking,
tying your shoes.

434
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,217
The treatment targets
the anterior cingulated
cortex.

435
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:27,516
It should only affect
your experiential memories.

436
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,440
So my parents? My childhood?

437
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:34,447
If this works,
you won't remember them.

438
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,536
Or your firefighting training.

439
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,376
And Amy.

440
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:44,175
Are you okay with that?

441
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,641
I wouldn't miss her, right?

442
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:50,898
Tell Amy how you feel.
Because if she loves you...

443
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:56,075
No. I won't do that to her.
Or to my brother.

444
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:03,090
You're effectively
killing who you are
just to keep this secret.

445
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:07,265
She doesn't love me.

446
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,317
(DOOR OPENING)

447
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:23,883
Caterpillar?

448
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:29,060
Lower intestine
with ulcerative colitis.

449
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:33,194
You crash art therapy classes
just for the adrenaline rush?

450
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:37,829
Cuddy wouldn't get off
the phone until I promised
I'd come and see for myself.

451
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:43,925
I got to admit,
this move I did not expect.

452
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:47,766
Well, don't tell anyone,
but the photos of smiling
people in the brochures,

453
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:49,478
it's just marketing.

454
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:52,902
Well, you're obviously
making an effort.

455
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,787
So I suppose the next step is
for me to talk to the DA.

456
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,255
Which you have
no intention of doing.

457
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:04,551
No.

458
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:09,770
So words mean nothing,
actions mean nothing,
what the hell is left?

459
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,871
You son of a bitch!

460
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:21,921
What about your words,
your actions?

461
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:26,973
"Got to get House cleaned up.
Got to get him
to show some humility."

462
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,144
But when it comes to actually
doing something,

463
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:31,649
you prove that all you
care about is
bitch-slapping a guy

464
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,779
who refused to kiss your ass!

465
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,620
You ever trust an addict?

466
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,336
You ever give one
the benefit of the doubt?

467
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,380
How many times
did that work out for you...

468
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:43,507
Yeah, I get it.

469
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:47,599
And so you were screwed over
by your wife, your mother,
your partner.

470
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:51,106
But you keep sending them
Christmas cards while you
take it out on everyone else!

471
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,069
No more Christmas cards.

472
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,574
No, I learned.

473
00:26:56,743 --> 00:27:00,334
People like you,
even your actions lie.

474
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:13,361
I'm scared.

475
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:14,614
I know.

476
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:19,708
I'm gonna give you
a muscle relaxant so your body
doesn't convulse.

477
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,795
Count backwards from 10.

478
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:29,478
Ten, nine, eight,

479
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,818
seven...

480
00:27:45,678 --> 00:27:46,889
Go.

481
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:04,050
CAMERON: What's your name?
Derek.

482
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:08,142
FOREMAN: Heart sounds good.

483
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:09,603
CAMERON: Do you know what city
we're in?

484
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:14,363
No.

485
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,453
Would you be okay with
a couple of visitors?

486
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:42,046
Derek, it's me. Brock.

487
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:50,480
I'm your brother,
and when you get out of here,
you'll be staying with me.

488
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,954
I'm Amy.

489
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:03,257
I'm your friend.

490
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:10,564
I'm sorry,
but I don't remember
either of you.

491
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:23,424
CAMERON: We've given him
four rounds of electroshock.

492
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:27,933
The charge made his voice
a little higher, but the EKG
and BP are good.

493
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,021
Good.

494
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:32,150
We're gonna give him
his last round in the morning,

495
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:34,113
then be in court
for your hearing.

496
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:35,324
Thanks.

497
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:39,499
I'm gonna stay here.
Monitor Derek.

498
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:45,177
Thanks for the update.

499
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:52,651
My next condolence call
is arriving.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

500
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:03,883
I got you something.

501
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,599
Nice.

502
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:13,779
I figured it might help make
a good impression
on the judge.

503
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:15,532
It's not that nice.

504
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:21,420
I had no business blaming you
for any of this.

505
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,182
I know you were just
trying to help me. Protect me.

506
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:30,104
That's what friends do.

507
00:30:33,152 --> 00:30:35,532
Is this an apology?

508
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:37,035
Part of the program.

509
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,209
If you don't like it,
I can stop.
Not at all.

510
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,670
It's just so

511
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:44,509
unfamiliar.

512
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,975
Please, keep going.

513
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,054
He looks lost.

514
00:31:06,138 --> 00:31:07,683
It's gonna take him a while.

515
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:12,234
Brock's pulling
a double shift.

516
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:15,950
He can't stand to
see him this way.

517
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:19,958
Derek's gonna need him, Amy.

518
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:23,340
I know the timing isn't great
with a wedding coming up.

519
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,177
What wedding?

520
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:27,390
Yours. You and Brock.

521
00:31:28,392 --> 00:31:31,273
We're not getting married.
We don't even date.

522
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:34,405
Why would you think
we're getting married?

523
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,207
When you first offered
Dr. House the chance
to check into drug rehab,

524
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:40,417
how did he respond?

525
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,923
He told me to
get out of his office.

526
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:47,683
I warned him that he could
end up in prison
and lose his medical license.

527
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:50,981
If he was concerned,
he didn't show it.

528
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:52,777
So you continued
your investigation?

529
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:53,862
Yes.

530
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,699
Which is what led me
to the hospital pharmacy.

531
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:57,411
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

532
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:58,998
Turn it off.
What did you
tell the pharmacist

533
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:01,086
was the reason
for your visit?

534
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,549
I thought I told you
never to call me
when I'm on trial.

535
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:06,138
The memories were false.
We fried his brain
for nothing.

536
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:07,891
Whatever was killing him
before is still there.

537
00:32:07,975 --> 00:32:08,935
We did an MRI.

538
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:11,399
<i>There's slight hypo-perfusion
in the anterior cortex.</i>

539
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:13,653
What did you find
when you checked
the pharmacy log?

540
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:15,491
Hold on, Mr. Vickers.

541
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:17,411
Thanks, Your Honor.
It's hard to hear.

542
00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:19,666
Did you test for clotting time
and LV function?

543
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:21,712
I believe that this is
a medical emergency,
Your Honor.

544
00:32:21,795 --> 00:32:24,092
His blood's normal
and his heart's pumping it
up to the brain.

545
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,511
But it's not all
getting there.

546
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:26,848
Something's obstructing
the blood flow...

547
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:28,685
Dr. House, you were given
adequate notice

548
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:30,188
to make arrangements
for your patients.

549
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:33,152
There's no hyper intensity
to suggest a foreign body
near the region.

550
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,198
<i>And no signs of infection
or vascular malformations.</i>

551
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,326
It's lower down.

552
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:37,578
Dr. House, hang up!

553
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:39,415
<i>CAMERON.:
The cytology on the LP
doesn't suggest a tumor.</i>

554
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,543
Now!

555
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:44,301
Hang on a second.

556
00:32:45,428 --> 00:32:48,726
Does your voice always
get that high and annoying
when you're angry?

557
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,355
Do you want to go to jail?

558
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:51,607
No, thank you.

559
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:56,284
Set him up for a selective
vertebral angiography.
I'm on my way.

560
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:57,954
Dr. House.

561
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:00,250
House! Sit down!

562
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:02,088
Why? I'm bored.

563
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:04,259
There's nothing I can say
or do that's gonna
make a difference here.

564
00:33:04,301 --> 00:33:07,474
If you leave this room,
I will find you in contempt.

565
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:09,269
Get a recess.

566
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,607
Are you out of your mind?

567
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:14,280
They said they wanted
me there, but I don't think
they like me.

568
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:16,409
His voice isn't high because
of the electrical charges.

569
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:18,914
It's another symptom
of menopause.

570
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,545
His system keeps getting hit
by women's issues,

571
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:23,298
so let's follow the pattern.

572
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:26,221
What might obstruct the blood
flow that's more common
in women than men?

573
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,933
Is the catheter in?
CHASE: Go back to court.

574
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:29,227
We'll let you know
the results.

575
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:31,065
Shut up and wire him.

576
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:35,741
Center the image
on the interpeduncular
cistern.

577
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:37,662
Keep it moving at
30 frames per second.

578
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:40,376
If you think the arteries
are narrowing,
you're gonna need still shots,

579
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:41,712
which we can do without you.

580
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:44,426
The problem is not
how wide the road is.

581
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:47,808
There's a guy with a squeegee
on the sidewalk flagging cars.

582
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,269
That's what's causing
the slowdown.

583
00:33:49,353 --> 00:33:51,941
We find him,
we find the problem.

584
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:53,779
He's wired.
Go!

585
00:33:53,862 --> 00:33:55,449
Injecting the dye.

586
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,789
Blood's in the capillaries.

587
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:00,459
There.

588
00:34:01,712 --> 00:34:03,382
Mr. Squeegee.

589
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,390
Spinal meningioma
pushing on the nerves
to the vocal cords

590
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:09,060
creates the voice change.

591
00:34:09,144 --> 00:34:12,067
And that nerve just happens
to live right near
the meningeal branch

592
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:16,200
of the vertebral artery,
obstructs the blood flow
to the brain.

593
00:34:16,242 --> 00:34:18,956
The brain malfunctions,
creating false memories.

594
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,923
Memories cause love.
Love kills.

595
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:26,931
And we didn't completely
screw up.

596
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:29,729
Cleaning the slate
bought us time to
find the real problem.

597
00:34:29,812 --> 00:34:31,482
On the other hand,
if we had been better,

598
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:33,319
we wouldn't have
needed the time.

599
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,365
Schedule him for surgery.
Dig that thing out.

600
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,789
He can start enjoying
real misery instead of
the fake stuff.

601
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,712
House.

602
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:46,263
I just heard that you
apologized to Wilson.

603
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:49,019
Detoxing. I didn't know
what I was saying.

604
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,580
Excuse me.

605
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:03,674
I have to go to jail.

606
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:10,522
What is your position at
Princeton-Plainsboro?

607
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:12,526
Chief Administrator
and Dean of Medicine.

608
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,572
And you're responsible
for oversight of the pharmacy?

609
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:15,825
Yes.

610
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,165
Sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt.

611
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:22,004
I hope you don't mind
that we continued on
without you?

612
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:25,219
I said I was sorry.
There's no need
to be sarcastic.

613
00:35:26,764 --> 00:35:28,100
What is this?

614
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:32,401
That's our
prescription sign-out log
from December 24th.

615
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:34,739
Does that appear to be
Dr. House's signature?

616
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:35,866
Yes.

617
00:35:35,908 --> 00:35:37,161
What has he signed for?

618
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:41,378
A prescription for oxycodone
in the name of patient
Larry Zebalusky.

619
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:43,298
And did those pills
ever reach that patient?

620
00:35:43,382 --> 00:35:44,468
No.
Why?

621
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:45,762
He was already dead.

622
00:35:45,804 --> 00:35:47,516
And Dr. House knew this?

623
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,559
Yes.

624
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:54,280
So, Dr. House had no legal
or medical basis for acquiring
that oxycodone?

625
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,165
Dr. Cuddy?

626
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:05,428
He never got the pills.

627
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:09,854
It's his signature.
The log is strictly
controlled.

628
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:13,027
Dr. House did pick up
a prescription,
but it wasn't for oxycodone.

629
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:15,825
It says oxycodone.
You testified...

630
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:18,372
I know,
but it wasn't oxycodone.

631
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:22,422
Dr. Wilson informed me
that Dr. House
already tried to steal

632
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:25,595
the pain medication
of this patient,
which made clear to me

633
00:36:25,678 --> 00:36:29,854
that Dr. House was in
a particularly vulnerable
and desperate state.

634
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,777
So I went to the pharmacy
and I swapped bottles.

635
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,198
Dr. House only got
a bottle with placebos.

636
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:37,912
I understand your impulse
to protect
a valued colleague...

637
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,666
I have it right here
on the inventory report...

638
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:42,422
Your Honor, she's lying!
She's obviously forged
that report.

639
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:43,549
In light of this evidence...

640
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:45,678
If this is real,
why didn't she
mention it earlier?

641
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,265
I move to dismiss this case!

642
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:48,601
There is other evidence,
Your Honor!

643
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:51,106
Everyone shut up and sit down.

644
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:55,282
Dr. Cuddy, why are you
only now coming forward
with this?

645
00:36:57,244 --> 00:37:00,000
I guess I never expected it
to go this far.

646
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:06,430
The witness is excused.

647
00:37:06,513 --> 00:37:08,100
Your Honor,
you can't seriously believe...

648
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,480
Dr. House, please stand.

649
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:15,532
My suspicion is your boss...

650
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:22,338
My suspicion is
you have better friends
than you deserve.

651
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,511
Rules and laws
apply to everyone.

652
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:28,267
You are not as special
as you think.

653
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:31,190
But Detective Tritter
chose to make you so.

654
00:37:31,273 --> 00:37:35,282
Detective, I don't know
exactly what's going on here,

655
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:38,956
but I am sure that this man
is not flooding the streets
with cocaine.

656
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:42,589
I'm also certain that,
knowing Dr. House,

657
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:44,384
he must have done something
to set you off.

658
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:47,223
But you're gonna have to
live with it.

659
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:52,025
Given Dr. Cuddy's testimony,
I'm not going to allow this
to proceed to jury.

660
00:37:52,108 --> 00:37:55,407
Case dismissed.
Court is adjourned.

661
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:02,797
Dr. House, you're still guilty
of contempt for that
little walkout earlier.

662
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:04,175
You'll be spending
the night in jail,

663
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:06,555
and after that you're
going right back
to your rehab.

664
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:10,230
Bailiff, take Dr. House
into custody.

665
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:18,246
Dr. House.

666
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,852
So should I be looking for you
in the shadows,

667
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:31,649
or flinch every time
a car backfires?

668
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:34,154
Good luck.

669
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:38,622
I hope I'm wrong about you.

670
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:53,027
CAMERON: They got
the meningioma.

671
00:38:53,528 --> 00:38:56,785
Your brain should
start generating
real memories again.

672
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:58,831
What do I do when I get out?

673
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,630
You have people who love you.
They'll take care of you.

674
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,681
You start over.

675
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:16,827
CUDDY: I'm surprised to see
you're not spooning your way
through the walls.

676
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:23,632
So, what do you say?
How about a conjugal
visit to celebrate?

677
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:27,683
There's nothing to celebrate,
House! You made me
perjure myself.

678
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:30,271
Fabricate evidence.

679
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:33,779
You make everyone around you
worse for being there.

680
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:40,125
The only bright spot is that
now I own your ass.

681
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:43,967
When you get out of rehab,
you're gonna be
pulling double clinic duty,

682
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,808
giving lectures to students,
helping me find donors,

683
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:51,524
pretty much anything else
I ask. You got it?

684
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,848
Your buprenorphine.

685
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,232
You get these from
the pharmacy
or from Voldemort?

686
00:40:11,315 --> 00:40:14,321
Voldemort. Why?
What difference does it...

687
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:21,754
That's Vicodin.
He's been slipping
you Vicodin?

688
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:26,472
No! He'd be risking his
minimum-wage job to do that.

689
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:34,447
The whole time?

690
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,077
My higher power said
it was okay.

691
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,831
Nothing's changed?

692
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:40,710
Nothing's changed.

693
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:54,655
The apology.

694
00:40:54,948 --> 00:40:57,745
You didn't need to do that
to make this work.

695
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:59,666
Believe what you want.

696
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:03,674
Good night, House.

697
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:07,015
I'll see you tomorrow.

698
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:08,392
Good night, Wilson.

699
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:11,148
