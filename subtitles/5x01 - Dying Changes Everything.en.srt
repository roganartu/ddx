1
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:06,198
Who picked this dump?

2
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:07,868
You suggested it.

3
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:10,467
I suggested you look into it.

4
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:11,723
The online reviews...

5
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:14,684
were obviously written by some geek
in their own marketing department.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,645
Next time, call someone you know.

7
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:19,189
Stop relying on a computer
to do your job for you.

8
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:22,023
Brightsize apparel, eight sexual
harassment suits in two years.

9
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:24,247
- Who asked for the meeting?
- They did.

10
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:32,013
Patty Michener,
president of Women's Majority, and...

11
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:35,468
Do you guys need me!

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,020
Nine men.

13
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:41,307
No one thought it might be
a good idea to put a suit on

14
00:00:41,497 --> 00:00:44,359
one of the gals from the steno pool
to make it look like you give a damn?

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,813
We've made it a priority
to promote more women, but...

16
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:49,620
Well, from now
on you have me standing beside you,

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,838
which is good.

18
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,044
Because your problem
is a national problem.

19
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:54,705
With all due respect, miss Michener,

20
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:57,907
I'd hardly call a few isolated incidents
a national problem.

21
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:00,910
Six out of ten victims
never even report harassment.

22
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:03,788
This is bigger than just eight women.

23
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:06,207
- That still only means 20.
- Not enough for you?

24
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,292
How many asses does your corporate
policy allow you to grab?

25
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:12,505
Tell you what you're gonna do.

26
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:15,190
You're gonna settle with anyone
you haven't settled with.

27
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,558
You're gonna fire any man
who's even been accused.

28
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,471
Somebody help me!
Please help me. I can't get 'em off!

29
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:21,848
Please help me!

30
00:01:22,643 --> 00:01:24,047
Help me, please!

31
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:26,102
Somebody help me!

32
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:28,021
Get 'em off.

33
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:31,706
You gonna call an ambulance, or
are you just gonna sit there and stare?

34
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,443
Help me, please!

35
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:43,412
House - Season 05 Episode 01
"Dying Change Everything"

36
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,465
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, Icefreak

37
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:14,561
www.house-fr.com

38
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:24,781
Wilson's back.

39
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,896
- You gonna...
- He's been gone two months.

40
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:32,031
He can wait till I finish slaying a guy
in a skullcap and a pair of tights.

41
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,128
On a video game you stole
from the pediatric ward?

42
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:38,174
On advice of counsel, I assert
my privilege pursuant to the fifth.

43
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:47,745
When was the last time
you talked to him?

44
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:49,540
I think it was after...

45
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:51,682
When did his girlfriend die?

46
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:55,099
He wanted time alone.

47
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:57,584
I considered being a horrendous
pain in the ass,

48
00:02:57,704 --> 00:02:59,690
but I didn't want to tread on your turf.

49
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,239
We got a case.

50
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:03,495
I've gotta remember to close the blinds.

51
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:06,484
Just got a call from Patty Michener
From Women's Majority, the women's...

52
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,743
- We know who she is.
- I dated her.

53
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,368
Well, not really dated her, more

54
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,918
metaphorically raped her
by having a penis.

55
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:15,114
You did too.

56
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:16,587
Her assistant flipped out.

57
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:19,298
Ripped off her clothes
in front of a room full of businessmen.

58
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,274
Well, either she cracked under the whip,

59
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:25,170
or she started to realize that her
evolutionary purpose is to arouse men,

60
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,846
not to castrate them.
Send her to psychiatric.

61
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:32,135
Anemia, bradycardia, and abdominal pain
aren't psychiatric symptoms.

62
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:35,874
Then it's the latter.
Send her to my apartment.

63
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:38,137
I'll give it to Segal.

64
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:40,396
House actually wants a case,
and you're saying no?

65
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:42,437
House has more important things to do.

66
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,591
Sorry, can't help you.

67
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,702
You need a specialist
to remove those kind of warts.

68
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:50,121
Preferably one
with experience spelunking.

69
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:59,627
Hallucinations, possible memory loss.

70
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:01,966
Tests show anemia, slow heart rate,

71
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:04,668
and a stubborn refusal
to shave her pits.

72
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,088
- Have you seen Wilson?
- Nope.

73
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:10,153
But I have seen the patient's
frequent flyer balance.

74
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:12,451
Eastern Europe,
Asia, Third-world countries.

75
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,768
- Sometimes more than one a day.
- No fever means

76
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,196
it's not a tropical disease.

77
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:18,668
If it's not where she went,
maybe it's the work hours.

78
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:20,613
Could be amphetamine abuse.
She's probably

79
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,446
- popping them like breath mints.
- You haven't been by his office?

80
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:26,324
Is Wilson hallucinating ants
crawling all over him too?

81
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:30,913
Tox screen's cleaner than
the windows she won't do.

82
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,741
Her job keeps her constantly
on the road, probably living off

83
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,113
of airline peanuts and diet soda.

84
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,602
Severe B12 deficiency
could cause all her symptoms.

85
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,539
Why is everyone leaping to conclude

86
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,520
a strong career woman's been made sick
by her strong career?

87
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,676
It's not B12,
she has an insulanoma in her pancreas.

88
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,378
It's making her hypoglycemic.

89
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:48,968
Great.

90
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:50,807
Now everyone knows.

91
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,810
You knew the patient had cancer?

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,467
Is that what she said?

93
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:57,446
I thought she said,

94
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,357
"I am suddenly
and irrationally defending

95
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,571
"the patient's strong career,
"even though in reality

96
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:03,361
"she's just a glorified grunt?

97
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,238
"I'm trying to convince my that it's OK

98
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:07,577
"not to have a life`cause
i don't have a life. `Cause

99
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:10,729
" I was tested for Huntington's,
and my life span's been cut in half."

100
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:15,648
Been waiting two months
for her to say that.

101
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,447
Hallucinations, anemia, bradycardia,

102
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,648
Hyper segmented polys
says that Taub's right.

103
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,045
Pump her full of B12.

104
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:24,799
See how a strong career woman's
been made sick by her strong career.

105
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:37,652
Are you okay?

106
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,743
Could be years before
you see any symptoms.

107
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:42,577
- Why wouldn't you tell us?
- I don't have Huntington's.

108
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:44,163
Are you lying to us...

109
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:46,036
Because it's none of our business?

110
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:48,406
Yes, then I shouldn't have
to answer these questions.

111
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:51,415
I wouldn't have to, except House doesn't
want to answer questions about Wilson.

112
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:53,533
He's deflecting
his own problems onto me.

113
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,223
Are you deflecting now?

114
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:58,849
Time for a B12 cocktail
and my life lesson.

115
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:06,465
No, Patty will do the hearing. She just
needs to be the leadoff witness so...

116
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,449
Okay, I'll lock it down today.

117
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,801
- I need you back in bed.
- My boss has a big Beijing trip.

118
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,734
I've been planning it for months.
I was just tired and dehydrated and

119
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:19,998
Yeah, whenever I lose
some shut-eye, I pound my legs,

120
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,170
clawing at imaginary ant colonies.

121
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,735
You have a severe B12 deficiency.
Get back in bed.

122
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:43,351
I'm sure your boss
can do without you for a few days.

123
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,734
It's not about her.

124
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,099
It's about me.

125
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,648
I want to be there.

126
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:49,569
- I want to matter.
- Yeah, without you,

127
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,140
who knows how much starch
they'd put in her shirts?

128
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,920
I'm sorry, I'm sure
your boss depends on you...

129
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,013
- I need to get up.
- No, you need to stay in bed.

130
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:01,284
Please, where's a bed pan?
Oh, my god, I'm sorry. I just,

131
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:04,353
I just had a bowel movement.

132
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:07,160
It's okay,
B12 deficiency can cause sudden...

133
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:12,048
That's not a bowel movement.

134
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:18,496
My patient...

135
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:22,083
Is still fighting in the feminist
trenches, but the war is over.

136
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:25,167
Yesterday's sluts
are today's empowered women.

137
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:27,143
Today's sluts are celebrities.

138
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:28,534
If that isn't progress...

139
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:29,858
I'm leaving.

140
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:33,799
What, are you gonna take
another two months?

141
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,839
Boy, you're really milking
this bereavement thing, aren't you?

142
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,487
I mean, good for you.
Take all the time you need.

143
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:42,645
I'm resigning.

144
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:46,273
Maybe moving out of New Jersey.
I don't know yet.

145
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:47,385
Okay.

146
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:50,208
That's an understandable reaction.

147
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:52,109
It's not a reaction.
It's a decision.

148
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,359
I'm writing Cuddy
my resignation right now.

149
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,895
I'm just back for the week to wrap up
my clinical and administrative duties.

150
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:02,081
You of all people should know,
this is bereavement 101.

151
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:04,443
You think that a change of venue...

152
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:07,049
Well, that spares me
decades of psychoanalysis.

153
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:10,798
- I'm not saying you're not in pain.
- You're saying my pain's a cliche.

154
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,259
- I'm saying that pain fades.
- Did yours?

155
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,511
Physical pain is different.

156
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:17,513
I'd rather have my leg chopped off.

157
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:20,178
- You don't know that, you haven't felt
- Neither have you.

158
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:24,721
Sorry, patient's got a rectal bleed.

159
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,354
- Busy.
- We need you to...

160
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,525
Actually, as you can see, I'm not busy.

161
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:31,255
It's just a euphemism for
"get the hell out of here."

162
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,241
This is your grief talking.

163
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,933
And, yeah, it is a bit textbook.

164
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,081
So before you give away all your
possessions to the Salvation Army...

165
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,453
My girlfriend's dead.
I'm glad you've read that book before.

166
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:46,725
I haven't.

167
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:50,171
I'm late to meet Dr. Olan to brief him
on the cases I'm handing over.

168
00:08:53,922 --> 00:08:54,683
Bye.

169
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,190
It doesn't bother you that House
wouldn't take just two seconds

170
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,654
- to talk about the patient?
- Wilson's dealing with a lot.

171
00:09:37,774 --> 00:09:38,995
Our patient may be dying.

172
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:41,379
She was bleeding out her rear.
We're looking up her rear.

173
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,571
We needed House's
expertise to set us on this course?

174
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:45,868
Her heart rate's slow
bleed should have made it faster.

175
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:47,984
It can wait till after
we know where it came from,

176
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:50,050
and after he's done dealing
with personal issues.

177
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,885
Yeah? That the way it works around here?
We get cut slack while we deal

178
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:54,369
with personal issues?

179
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:59,429
You're not the boss.
Boss gets to make the rules.

180
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,519
Boss gets to ignore...

181
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,450
She's bleeding from...

182
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:07,224
Nowhere.

183
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:11,827
- You did an endoscopy?
- And a colonoscopy.

184
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,084
- CT scan?
- Ordered.

185
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,124
It shouldn't show anything
the endoscopy didn't.

186
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:17,252
- We can't do a CT scan.
- Why not?

187
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:19,539
We don't need a CT scan.
We don't need House.

188
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,078
Stop grinning and talk.

189
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:23,223
One of the routine
pre-procedure tests was positive.

190
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:24,157
Which one?

191
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:27,048
The one that, if it's positive,
would explain a hormone imbalance

192
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,270
that could screw with
heart rate and blood flow.

193
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:33,567
Guess she does have a life
beyond her career.

194
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:36,276
I'm pregnant?

195
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,335
You want me to call the father
and let him know?

196
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:41,060
Soon as you do some DNA testing,
let me know.

197
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,810
Must be hard
to have a real relationship...

198
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,887
Are you making excuses for me?

199
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:49,861
- I'm just saying it's understandable.
- You only have to understand something

200
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,238
if it needs an explanation.
I have needs.

201
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:54,810
I met my needs. End of explanation.

202
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,550
How recently were you...

203
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,368
Needy?

204
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:01,080
It's been two or three months, at least.

205
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:03,495
What?

206
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,607
What is it?

207
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:06,295
Nothing.

208
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:09,255
- Tell me.
- It's actually nothing.

209
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:15,053
The ultrasound shows
no trace of a baby at all.

210
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:20,487
Positive pregnancy test, no pregnancy.

211
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:24,235
B12 deficit rectified,
but her heart's slowing even more.

212
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:26,175
And a bleed should speed her heart rate.

213
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:32,950
House,
this is the kind of case you love.

214
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,319
Contradictions piling up left and right.

215
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:42,288
Two false positive pregnancy tests,
bradycardia, lower G.I. Bleed. Go.

216
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:45,540
Choriocarcinoma,
would've triggered pregnancy hormones.

217
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,301
Also would have shown on a sonogram.

218
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,251
Immunoglobulin "A" deficiency.

219
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:50,629
No urinary bleed.

220
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:54,066
If she's had Beta HCG injections,
they can cross-react with...

221
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:56,857
Keep going.

222
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:01,929
You're being an idiot.

223
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:03,781
You're gonna blow up your career.

224
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:06,347
And six months from now,
when you've moved on from Amber to

225
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:09,274
Burnt Sienna, you're gonna be stuck
in a mobile oncology truck

226
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:10,976
in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.

227
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:14,407
I'd need a flow chart
to explain all the ways

228
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,751
in which that was ridiculously
insensitive.

229
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:19,904
- You can't hide from misery.
- This isn't your business.

230
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:22,287
My skull was cracked open
trying to save her!

231
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,320
Then we all need
a little tea and sympathy.

232
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,191
I'm through discussing it.

233
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,071
Uh, we have a patient.

234
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,540
Who's obviously not going anywhere
with a bloody rectum.

235
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,009
Great to have you back.

236
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,547
- Actually, I'm...
- Actually,

237
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,315
he's about to thrust a tanto
into the belly of his career.

238
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,048
I'm leaving the hospital.

239
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:41,867
I'm sorry,
this is obviously a terrible time

240
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:43,205
Why are you leaving?

241
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,624
I just need a change of scenery.

242
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:46,962
Buy a plant.

243
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,320
Rectal bleeding,
two positive pregnancy tests.

244
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,775
There's nothing we can do?

245
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,225
You could ask House to be a grown-up
and respect my decision.

246
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:56,365
I respect things that deserve respect.
This decision, on the other hand,

247
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,676
is a dog wearing a cape!

248
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:59,324
Hallucinations. Heart won't respond

249
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,456
The patient tested
positive for pregnancy

250
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:03,344
because the patient is pregnant.

251
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,718
Hey, who are you?

252
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:21,648
This is Dr. House.
He's too brilliant for introductions.

253
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,764
False positive.

254
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:25,610
You're too busy to be running
a day care center in your abdomen.

255
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,988
False positive.

256
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,816
Not to mention you should wait
till at least 30 to punish that

257
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,623
pleasure portal
with a 7-pound tissue expander.

258
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:33,789
I'm 37.

259
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:35,934
And I thought I wasn't pregnant.

260
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:37,542
37?

261
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,488
Impressive.

262
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:44,452
Too bad
you're not passing on those genes.

263
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:47,640
Does that look false to you?

264
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:50,750
You were looking in the wrong room.

265
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,625
It's more common
when the egg lands in the oven.

266
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,712
Sometimes
it winds up in the fallopian tubes.

267
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:58,706
In rare cases, it plummets
through the plumbing entirely.

268
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:00,991
It's using her intestine
as a blood supply.

269
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:03,417
It caused the rectal bleed, and now

270
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:07,646
junior Miss Steinem's junior
must be pressing on her vagus nerve,

271
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,738
slowing her heart to a crawl.

272
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:13,562
Yank the fetus. If she survives
the surgery, she'll be fine.

273
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:25,924
What if she wants to keep the baby?

274
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,495
She doesn't.

275
00:14:27,772 --> 00:14:29,904
We can't take
two seconds to discuss this?

276
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:32,706
Fetuses have been transplanted before.
Whole uteruses too.

277
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:35,751
Just terminating the fetus
when it's glued to her intestines

278
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:37,046
is high-risk surgery.

279
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,422
Saving it is a fantasy.
That was at least three seconds.

280
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,330
She's a 37-year-old woman
who deserves...

281
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,958
People get what they get.

282
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:48,121
It has nothing to do
with what they deserve.

283
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:50,161
And this has nothing to do
with her genitalia,

284
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:52,113
and everything to do
with your genetics.

285
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:54,808
- You told me to get tested.
- I didn't know it was gonna color

286
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,007
your every medical opinion,
every personal opinion.

287
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,527
- You didn't think a death sentence...
- People die!

288
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,766
You, Amber, everyone.

289
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:06,615
Don't act like you just figured
that out. I gave you a diagnosis.

290
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:09,048
If you don't like it, there are exits
on every floor.

291
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:28,917
I'm sorry to be
so definitive about this.

292
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:30,750
I know you're still absorbing
the news,

293
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,469
but we have no choice.

294
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:34,556
Remove the fetus.
Absolutely.

295
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:39,284
I have no boyfriend, no husband.

296
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:41,472
I'm on the road with Patty
all the time.

297
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:44,611
Where do I sign?

298
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,351
- You feel any tenderness back here?
- No, not at all.

299
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,502
Treating professional
sports injuries now?

300
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:58,850
No, I'm not...

301
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,922
Familiar with the concept
of sarcasm.

302
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:02,673
Don't sweat it, it's new.

303
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:05,674
- Have you spoken to Wilson?
- We'll get you an EKG, I come back.

304
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:07,863
You want me to sleep with him
to get him to stay?

305
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:10,316
I put the bisexual chick on that.

306
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,450
If you'd like to sit in,
so to speak...

307
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,883
- I spoke to him.
- What'd you tell him?

308
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:16,916
I didn't tell him anything.
I listened.

309
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:19,316
So you could feel good
about doing nothing.

310
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,267
Tell him...

311
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,931
I am not your errand girl.
Best thing about leaving you...

312
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,989
The two of you used to be together?

313
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:27,885
She dumped me when I lost
the last 85 pounds.

314
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:30,960
Said there was less of me to love.

315
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:33,650
Grief means different things
to different people.

316
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,853
Case in point,
means very little to you.

317
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,226
Grief is Newark.

318
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:39,085
Okay, it's there.
You can't avoid it.

319
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:41,671
The idea is to hold your nose,
hope the traffic's not too bad,

320
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:44,684
and get on to Manhattan as quickly
as possible, not to buy property.

321
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,552
- You think that's facing up to things?
- I'm not the one who's quitting.

322
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:50,310
- 'cause you haven't lost anything.
- But you have.

323
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:51,764
He'll listen to you.

324
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,100
What did you do
when your husband died?

325
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,199
I got a new job and I moved.

326
00:16:59,527 --> 00:17:01,539
See how crappy
that worked out?

327
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:06,455
Separating

328
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:10,462
the placenta from the wall
of the large intestine.

329
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:12,827
Sponge.

330
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:15,064
Suction.
We've got some bleeding.

331
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:17,683
BP's dropping. 90 systolic.

332
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,554
- She's bleeding like hell. Clamp.
- BP's still dropping.

333
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:22,627
Amp of calcium chloride, fast!

334
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:24,968
- still dropping.
- Shut up! Squeeze her spleen.

335
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:27,190
We need to force platelets out
so her blood clots.

336
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,756
She's in weak shape.
Spleen's friable. It could rupture.

337
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:36,434
She's stabilizing.

338
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:38,413
Oozing's drying up.

339
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,209
I hate visitors day.

340
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:44,999
Removing the fetus.

341
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:57,538
You have to stop Wilson
from committing career malpractice.

342
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:01,531
- Talk to him.
- I already talked to him twice.

343
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:02,756
He threw me out.

344
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:04,921
Mocking him and insulting him...

345
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:08,591
Let's see, yes, technically
those are categories of conversation.

346
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:10,778
Block his references
to other hospitals.

347
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:12,877
Tell him he can't
hand off his cases until...

348
00:18:12,997 --> 00:18:14,004
Talk to him.

349
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:16,999
Deal with his grief. Talk to him
about what he's going through.

350
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,617
That's a brilliant idea.
I'll take him out for a beer.

351
00:18:19,737 --> 00:18:22,150
That'll make up for the fact
that Amber's in a pine box.

352
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,732
That there's randomness
and chaos in the universe.

353
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:26,531
Tell him you're sorry.

354
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:28,068
I didn't kill her.

355
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:29,526
You were drunk and...

356
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:33,414
Yeah, if her daddy hadn't been drunk,
she might never have been born. So...

357
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:35,483
You called her up
in the middle of the night.

358
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:37,581
She was on the bus because of you.

359
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,416
I didn't ask her to come out.

360
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:42,158
I wasn't driving the bus.
I wasn't driving the garbage truck

361
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:43,339
that hit the bus.

362
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,876
And I did not prescribe her
the flu meds that killed her.

363
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:48,047
Yes, I know, that's all true.
But.

364
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:54,345
You really don't feel
any sense of guilt?

365
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:01,702
You want to keep him,
he needs to know he's not alone.

366
00:19:01,822 --> 00:19:03,830
Just tell him you feel like crap.

367
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,734
It'd be meaningless.

368
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,017
Well, then,
find some meaning.

369
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:10,931
And do something.

370
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:23,417
- She's got a neurological problem.
- Surgical complication?

371
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,183
Don't think so.
She keeps on blinking.

372
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:28,190
- Her heart's not recovering either.
- So the pregnancy was a coincidence.

373
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,339
Pulse is down to 39.
She's maxed out on atropine.

374
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,758
We're installing a pacing wire to...

375
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:34,799
avoid that. We need some help!

376
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,292
- Page House.
- Already done.

377
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:37,762
Page him again.

378
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:48,793
- It's for you.
- If I told you that I was sorry,

379
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:52,445
- would it change anything?
- I wouldn't believe you.

380
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:54,220
If you believe me.

381
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,908
It's hard to imagine
such a world.

382
00:19:57,354 --> 00:19:58,606
I'm going home...

383
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,800
Until you agree to stay
at this hospital.

384
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,125
You can't be... That's blackmail.

385
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:09,378
And to do your job?
Why not hold a gun to your own head?

386
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:12,213
Your conscience bleeds
more freely than my head.

387
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:16,589
Text.

388
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,013
Patient's in cardiac arrest.

389
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:20,169
Ouchy.

390
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,304
You'd jeopardize
a patient

391
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:25,425
- because of my...
- If it keeps you here.

392
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:29,341
Your friendship matters
more to me than this patient.

393
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,157
I've gotta do what's right
for me.

394
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:35,047
You've gotta do what's right
for you.

395
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,866
But it comes easier for me.

396
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,357
Where is he?

397
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,242
Where is he?

398
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:06,591
- Status.
- Her heart's stabilized.

399
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:09,563
We have a pacing wire in her, but
the bradycardia isn't getting better.

400
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,023
House is bluffing.

401
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:12,843
I called him. He's not picking up.

402
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:15,056
- What do we do?
- What you'd do if he was here.

403
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:17,363
If he was here, we'd be
asking him what to do.

404
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,278
- What are the usual suspects?
- There aren't any.

405
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:22,398
She had a vitamin deficiency,
and we corrected it,

406
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,421
- an ectopic pregnancy, we removed it.
- But her heart problem won't go away,

407
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,479
and now something's wrong
with her brain.

408
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:30,508
I have complete confidence
in you guys.

409
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:34,924
Who wants to go service House

410
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,590
so this patient can live?

411
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,736
We can do this without him. Maybe
something happened during the surgery.

412
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:41,470
It was on her bowel, not her brain.

413
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:44,076
Anxiety, stroke, Tourette's
could all cause eye blinking.

414
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:46,212
Cause her heart to beat faster,
It's slowing down.

415
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:47,096
M.S.

416
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:49,520
If a lesion took out the sympathetic
innervation of her heart,

417
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,302
It'd explain bradycardia and blinking.

418
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:54,430
But not the vitamin deficiency
or the ectopic pregnancy.

419
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,188
- House would want a unifying theory.
- He's gone, and so are those symptoms.

420
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:01,136
M.S. explains everything
that's wrong with her right now.

421
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:02,989
Start her on interferon for M.S.

422
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:10,222
Mind if I come in?

423
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:12,752
- Not at all.
- You mind if I leave?

424
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:18,501
I told you not to take that case
specifically to deal with Wilson.

425
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:21,469
And the two ended up dovetailing
rather nicely, don't you think?

426
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:24,801
Is this how you show your friendship...
By bludgeoning him with guilt?

427
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:27,099
Because he's my friend,
I know what works on him.

428
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:30,186
- You can't walk away from a patient.
- Then fire me.

429
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:32,938
You're willing to risk your career,
but youcan't say you're sorry.

430
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:35,357
I told him I'm sorry.
He didn't believe it.

431
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:37,109
- Make him believe it.
- I don't.

432
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:38,945
You don't want to believe it.

433
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:41,614
Because if you tell Wilson
how you actually feel about him,

434
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:43,365
about what happened to Amber,

435
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:47,268
about your part in what happened,
and he walks out the door anyway...

436
00:22:47,388 --> 00:22:49,246
If you make yourself
vulnerable for once

437
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:52,218
in your nerve-deadening,
emotionally obliterating...

438
00:22:53,424 --> 00:22:55,321
You're doing the same thing he is.

439
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:56,746
You're running away.

440
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:59,071
Only he's not killing anyone
in the process.

441
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:05,471
Where's Dr. House?

442
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,412
He's not feeling well.

443
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:09,850
Was M.S. his idea?

444
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:11,720
We work as a team.

445
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,752
You know how it is. Collaborative.

446
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,940
Sometimes it's hard to tell
where an idea mes from.

447
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,787
But you're not really a team.

448
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,420
You work for him.

449
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,437
And you work for Patty.

450
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:27,271
I'm sure a lot of her ideas
are actually...

451
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,709
She would be fine without me.

452
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:32,654
I'd be nothing
without her.

453
00:23:32,774 --> 00:23:34,545
Maybe if you just had the chance.

454
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,669
I'm sure you've learned a lot.

455
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,438
Not everybody's created equal.

456
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,758
Does Dr. House think I have M.S.?

457
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,448
Did you just shiver?

458
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:58,906
You're running a slight fever.

459
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:00,150
Is that bad?

460
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,065
It means we were
wrong about the M.S.

461
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,796
- You had my cable disconnected!
- That's quite a leap.

462
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,427
Just because I happen to have
a 31-person maintenance department...

463
00:24:13,547 --> 00:24:15,361
each of whom you've personally abused

464
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:16,758
- at some point...
- Why?

465
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:18,954
You thought I could let someone die,

466
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,168
but I'm gonna fold
if I can't watch Celebrity Bowling?

467
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:23,221
That is not an unreasonable theory.

468
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:26,002
Especially with only ten minutes
till your favorite soap.

469
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,541
Gee, is this the remote
from the doctors' lounge?

470
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,436
This is your 911?

471
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:37,180
- Good-bye.
- Stop!

472
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:41,808
I'm withholding your salary history
from every hospital in this region.

473
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:42,928
You go, girl.

474
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:46,467
And I'm permanently setting
every TV in this building

475
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:50,541
to the pottery channel
unless you both sit down.

476
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,813
Welcome to couples counseling.

477
00:24:55,284 --> 00:24:57,098
- It's not the surgery.
- The timing fits.

478
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:59,323
The location doesn't,
unless brains are in bowels

479
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:02,421
If bacteria entered her bloodstream,
it could have infected her brain.

480
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:04,686
The surgery went fine.
You were there.

481
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:07,081
Peptostreptococcus
could explain the blinking and...

482
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,899
You want to watch a grainy video
and have an epiphany.

483
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:12,640
Shut up. You're making me miss
House's mocking.

484
00:25:14,575 --> 00:25:16,561
You told us
it was none of our business,

485
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,763
but if your Huntington's
is affecting you,

486
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,678
- maybe it...
- It's not, I don't have...

487
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:22,455
You're desperate to do it
without him.

488
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:24,431
You're not trying to cure her,
but to prove...

489
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:25,724
Stop the tape.

490
00:25:27,246 --> 00:25:28,265
Zoom in.

491
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:35,079
- On the anastomosis, that little bump.
- It's a hematoma.

492
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:39,090
A harmless pocket of blood, which is
why Chase ignored it during the surgery.

493
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,914
Could be a ganglioma, which is why Chase
shouldn't have ignored it.

494
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:44,640
It's an abnormal growth of nerves,

495
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,009
it could be causing
all the patient's symptoms.

496
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:50,711
We have to open her up again.
Get a piece of it.

497
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:58,564
- So what do you want to tell us?
- Nothing.

498
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:01,981
Nothing I say is gonna change anything.
You guys need to talk.

499
00:26:02,404 --> 00:26:04,683
Actually, you should read
the psych literature.

500
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:06,652
Repression's gaining a lot of fans.

501
00:26:06,884 --> 00:26:09,521
- What you don't face can't crush you.
- Talk to each other.

502
00:26:12,246 --> 00:26:14,413
- How you doing? Good?
- Fine, thanks.

503
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:17,705
Sit!

504
00:26:20,062 --> 00:26:21,755
See, the two of you are friends.

505
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,896
- Look how you both...
- Think you're an idiot.

506
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,975
We both also eat with forks.

507
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:28,048
- That doesn't really prove...
- Talk to him!

508
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,454
Tell him how you feel
about what he's doing.

509
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:31,677
He's an idiot.

510
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:34,221
Tell him what you think
about him leaving.

511
00:26:34,474 --> 00:26:37,086
- I think he's an idiot.
- You're an idiot. He's in pain.

512
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:39,421
And your response is just
to emotionally blackmail him.

513
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,353
You told me your position.

514
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:44,310
- You're against it, right?
- She hasn't told you in front of me.

515
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,182
- She needs to prove she's on my side.
- Go to hell.

516
00:26:47,758 --> 00:26:50,654
- So much for that theory.
- I'm sorry you lost Amber.

517
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:53,112
I cannot imagine what it is
you're going through.

518
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:55,435
But it will not get better
by you walking away

519
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:57,590
from everyone that cares about you.

520
00:26:58,353 --> 00:27:01,022
Do you think Amber
would want you to walk away?

521
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:03,810
Nobody at this hospital
even liked Amber.

522
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:13,579
Same time next week?

523
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,744
You want me to do
a second major surgery

524
00:27:19,864 --> 00:27:22,967
on a patient we almost lost
during a first major surgery

525
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:25,527
to see if she needs
a third major surgery?

526
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:27,203
We need a piece of the ganglioma.

527
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:29,276
Then you're talking
about another patient.

528
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:31,134
Yours doesn't have a ganglioma.

529
00:27:31,254 --> 00:27:33,072
And if there is one
and you missed it?

530
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:36,450
So you're talking about another surgeon.
I didn't miss anything.

531
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,191
But we're not talking about another
videotape. It showed a bump.

532
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:41,028
- We need to biopsy.
- A bump?

533
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:44,458
My grandfather died of a bump.

534
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:49,229
She can't survive a second round
of general anesthesia,

535
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:51,256
- let alone a third.
- You'd do this for House.

536
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,964
What do you suggest?

537
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:57,468
Because the patient's got
a high fever, a low heart rate,

538
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:00,349
and a dim chance of survival
if we stand here like idiots.

539
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,399
Then I suggest
you don't stand there like idiots.

540
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,240
How do you get coal out of a mountain
when it's someone else's mountain?

541
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:12,528
If we don't have House,
we can think like him.

542
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:15,071
But it does mean we don't have
to talk like him.

543
00:28:15,191 --> 00:28:17,178
You don't dig down.
You go in from the side.

544
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:19,353
We insert a lighted scope
through the rectum,

545
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:21,439
move the intestine till we find
the ganglioma,

546
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,373
then push it to the surface.
Where we see the light, we cut.

547
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,269
We'll make as small
an incision as we can.

548
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:33,840
But unfortunately,
it'll be very painful.

549
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,577
After your surgery experience,
we can't give you anesthesia.

550
00:28:36,697 --> 00:28:37,886
Can I talk to Dr. House?

551
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,271
No.

552
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:43,082
We can do this.
We know what we're doing.

553
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:46,019
I don't mean to be insulting,
but my former boss

554
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,333
didn't insist on me coming here
because of you or...

555
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:49,634
Your former boss?

556
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:51,445
I've been replaced.

557
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:56,390
- I'm sorry. You must be...
- I'm fine.

558
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:59,616
She has a big Beijing trip.
Ton of work to do.

559
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,035
She can't just wait for me
to get better.

560
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:06,665
We've been well-trained.
We'll take good care of you.

561
00:29:13,972 --> 00:29:16,008
How can you let her treat you
like a footstool?

562
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:19,970
- The world needs flunkies.
- Don't say that.

563
00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:21,584
You're better than that.

564
00:29:21,704 --> 00:29:23,724
I have no problem with it.
Why do you?

565
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,644
Because...
Life is short.

566
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:29,646
Yours could've ended in that surgery.

567
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:31,813
You'd have never lived for yourself.

568
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:35,194
What kind of feminist...
We can have anything.

569
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:36,291
No, we can't.

570
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:39,780
We can aspire to anything.

571
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:43,619
But we don't get it just
because we want it.

572
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,516
I would rather spend my life
close to the birds

573
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:49,635
than waste it wishing I had wings.

574
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,347
You're through the sigmoid,
into the descending colon.

575
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:04,932
Switching on the light.

576
00:30:05,092 --> 00:30:06,642
Advance toward the anastomosis.

577
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:10,267
That's it.

578
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,232
Push the wall of the intestine
toward the skin.

579
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:20,086
There, I see it.

580
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,256
Don't look down.

581
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,378
Scalpel.

582
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:42,702
So your last day is Friday.

583
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:44,953
I'm gonna miss you.

584
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:47,099
You shouldn't go.

585
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:50,544
Did house ask you to talk to me,
or are you trying to save the patient?

586
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:52,688
- Because there'll always be...
- House asked me.

587
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:55,023
- And you're doing it.
- I told him to go to hell.

588
00:30:57,044 --> 00:30:58,193
Thanks.

589
00:30:58,548 --> 00:30:59,778
But I think he's right.

590
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,119
You think you're making
a rational choice.

591
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,745
You think the worst is over.

592
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:10,952
And then...

593
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:15,115
Six months later you look back
and you realize...

594
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:17,087
You didn't know what you were doing.

595
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:19,033
Are you saying the pain doesn't go away?

596
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,173
It gets easier.

597
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:23,051
Not in two months.
Not in two years.

598
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:25,387
But no...

599
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:27,472
It never really goes away.

600
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:28,958
Being here...

601
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:31,383
This building...

602
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,462
I was just in the lounge.
I kept staring at Amber's locker.

603
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:36,554
I saw a guy wearing
a scarf this morning.

604
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,850
The color reminded me of his eyes.

605
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,809
We lived 500 miles from here.

606
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:45,701
- I have to do something.
- Then do it.

607
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,184
But don't think it's the right choice,
because...

608
00:31:53,723 --> 00:31:54,950
There isn't one.

609
00:31:57,522 --> 00:31:58,670
It's not a ganglioma.

610
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,715
- The problem wasn't the surgery.
- Abnormally deposited proteins.

611
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:05,212
It's amyloidosis. That would explain
the blinking and the low heart rate.

612
00:32:05,332 --> 00:32:07,763
Only way to treat amyloidosis is
to treat whatever's causing it.

613
00:32:07,978 --> 00:32:10,213
It's not as if a lot of things
cause amyloid.

614
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,499
Rheumatoid arthritis.

615
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,018
Familial mediterranean fever.

616
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:14,283
Lymphoma.

617
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:16,871
We can't all be right.
But you can all be wrong.

618
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:18,411
The patient's joints don't hurt,

619
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:21,234
abdominal pain went away when the fetus
did, and no palpable lymph nodes.

620
00:32:21,677 --> 00:32:24,443
- Got anything constructive to say?
- Sorry. Sorry.

621
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:28,450
Um, she has lots and lots of palpable
lymph nodes, joint and abdominal pain.

622
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:30,052
She'll be better by dinnertime.

623
00:32:30,172 --> 00:32:32,120
If we don't find the cause
of the amyloidosis,

624
00:32:32,337 --> 00:32:35,082
we never get her off that wire,
she never walks out of this hospital.

625
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:38,900
But hey, who needs House, hmm?

626
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,118
So glad we lost those training wheels.

627
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:45,672
You want me to make the call?

628
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:48,288
There seems to be some disagreement.

629
00:32:48,408 --> 00:32:51,539
And this isn't just a pretext
to pressure me into staying?

630
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,083
Does it look like a pretext?

631
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:54,600
No.

632
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,821
She really is dying, isn't she?

633
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,288
Inflammation, enlarged nuclei,

634
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:04,820
some mitotic activity.
It could be lymphoma.

635
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,698
There are no palpable lymph nodes.

636
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,664
It makes it less likely,
but it doesn't rule it out.

637
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,976
I'm an oncologist.
I see cancer.

638
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:15,357
Show it to an immunologist,
they'll see autoimmune.

639
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:17,643
I already showed it to an immunologist.

640
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,990
We'll start her on chemo.

641
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,728
You should leave.

642
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:26,795
House doesn't want to lose his sidekick.

643
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:29,233
Cuddy doesn't want to lose
her check on house.

644
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:31,055
No one's talking about what you want.

645
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:33,560
It's not that I want to.

646
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,353
Want to, need to.

647
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,254
If there's any chance that being
away from here will make your life

648
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:42,033
even a little bit easier, do it.

649
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:45,319
That's what everyone else
here would do.

650
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:06,715
Don't expect anything
to change too fast.

651
00:34:07,187 --> 00:34:08,467
Lymphoma was your idea?

652
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,120
- Why?
- I feel better.

653
00:34:13,106 --> 00:34:15,328
Sometimes just knowing
you're being treated helps.

654
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:17,279
You've given me 18 different treatments.

655
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,872
This is the first one
that made me feel better.

656
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:22,204
I don't think it's psychological.

657
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:24,767
Thank you.

658
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,031
I'm sorry.

659
00:34:29,898 --> 00:34:33,617
I shouldn't have gotten angry at you.
Your choices are your choices.

660
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,286
You're not like me.

661
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,531
Maybe you have wings.

662
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:50,607
I have huntington's chorea.

663
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,949
Dozen years or so, my...

664
00:34:56,607 --> 00:35:00,311
nervous system, my cognitive skills,
even my emotional balance...

665
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,220
They'll all start to fray.

666
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:04,648
I won't be able to fly.

667
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:07,520
I won't be able to walk.

668
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:10,372
I won't be able to breathe.

669
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,517
And you want to make sure
your life matters.

670
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,104
I don't want to just...

671
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,814
Be tightening bolts
and following instructions.

672
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:25,459
I want something...

673
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:30,132
To be different because of me.

674
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:32,373
I am.

675
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:36,961
Not just 'cause you saved my life.

676
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:42,144
I'm applying for a job at a foundation.

677
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:44,672
Running the finance division.

678
00:35:46,588 --> 00:35:49,074
I mean, I don't know
if I'm gonna get it, but...

679
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,904
If I don't...
There are other foundations.

680
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:01,147
It's almost 4:00.

681
00:36:01,937 --> 00:36:02,903
Soap time.

682
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:07,752
Nurses' remote.
Works in the doctors' lounge.

683
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:10,103
Why do you think Wilson's leaving?

684
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:16,094
How many times do I have
to use the word "idiot"?

685
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:17,888
That's a good enough answer for you?

686
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,003
Whenever anyone does
anything out of the norm,

687
00:36:20,164 --> 00:36:23,894
you have to tell them what screwed-up
process is really at work in their head.

688
00:36:24,054 --> 00:36:26,021
That is why I locked
the two of you in a room.

689
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:28,554
So you would say something
stupid and insensitive,

690
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:31,008
and maybe with a little bit of truth.

691
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:32,918
But you didn't.

692
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:36,656
So I can only assume
that you don't want to know the reason.

693
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:39,085
You're afraid to know.

694
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:44,024
You're not listening to me, are you?

695
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:47,334
Try it sometime.
You'll see why.

696
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,318
You look 37.

697
00:36:58,598 --> 00:36:59,930
I am 37.

698
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:02,932
You looked 27 last week.

699
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:05,894
Unless I blacked out for ten years.
Your skin...

700
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:08,188
She's got lymphoma.
The chemo's probably...

701
00:37:08,348 --> 00:37:10,380
- Stop the chemo.
- She's getting better.

702
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,014
- Bradycardia's improving, we...
- She have bruising?

703
00:37:13,175 --> 00:37:15,481
She was pounding her legs
during the hallucinations.

704
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:17,535
It's not lymphoma.

705
00:37:19,181 --> 00:37:20,898
Hey, don't...
No, no, no.

706
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:25,455
My bad.

707
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:26,960
Thought no meant yes.

708
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:29,960
Those aren't bruises.

709
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:32,170
They're mycobacterial lesions.

710
00:37:32,404 --> 00:37:34,548
She has diffuse lepromatous leprosy.

711
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:37,801
Must have caught it on one
of her overseas estrogen tours.

712
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,888
Chemo wipes out some of the bacteria,
she feels a little better.

713
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:44,779
Wipes out most of her immune system,
she gets a whole lot worse.

714
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:45,809
Leprosy?!

715
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,194
Like where my limbs fall off?

716
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:50,274
Actually, this is the flattering one.

717
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,190
It's also known as "pretty leprosy".

718
00:37:52,424 --> 00:37:55,360
It doesn't disfigure, it makes
your skin look younger, smoother.

719
00:37:55,592 --> 00:37:57,006
Don't let the girls hear.

720
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:58,878
They'll all want to lick your face.

721
00:37:58,998 --> 00:38:01,493
Unless you're that kind of feminist.

722
00:38:02,518 --> 00:38:04,655
Blast her with antibiotics
and Prednisone.

723
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:05,859
She'll be fine.

724
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,582
Damn, it's after 4:00.
I'm late.

725
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,409
- Damn.
- What?

726
00:38:14,076 --> 00:38:15,773
She's happy you're gonna be fine.

727
00:38:16,146 --> 00:38:19,134
But she'd be happier if you were gonna
be fine five minutes ago.

728
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:28,935
Tests confirmed Dr. House's diagnosis.

729
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,834
Thank God.

730
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,692
When you got pregnant,

731
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:39,112
he physical stress triggered
e. Nodosum Lleprosum.

732
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:41,114
A common complication of leprosy.

733
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:43,533
Inflamed the nerves to your heart.

734
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:46,995
Made it hard to absorb vitamins,
scarred your fallopian tubes.

735
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:48,836
It explains everything.

736
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:53,918
Better prescribe me some
skin cream too?

737
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:56,171
You might want it
for those job interviews.

738
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,200
I'm going back on the road with Patty.
My replacement flamed out.

739
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:07,861
She says I can manage some projects
on my own, carve out more of a role.

740
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,268
Do you really think she can change?

741
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:12,583
I don't know.

742
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:17,567
The truth is, I'm not sure I...

743
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:18,943
You can change.

744
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:20,153
No...

745
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:23,615
I'm not sure I want her to change.

746
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:27,463
She's reasonable.

747
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,261
She's just another employer,
and I'm just...

748
00:39:32,105 --> 00:39:33,479
another employee.

749
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:38,898
In a weird way, I matter.

750
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:46,992
I like you better now that you're dying.

751
00:39:48,682 --> 00:39:49,816
I was wrong.

752
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:51,738
You took a shot.

753
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:56,655
She's going back to work for that idiot.

754
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:58,648
It's pathetic.

755
00:39:59,404 --> 00:40:01,177
You thought something would change?

756
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:03,400
She almost died...

757
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,491
Because of that job.
Yeah, I... I thought...

758
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:09,577
Almost dying changes nothing.

759
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,160
Dying changes everything.

760
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,071
I'm sorry.

761
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:50,306
I know I didn't try to kill her.
I know I didn't want her hurt.

762
00:40:51,878 --> 00:40:54,164
I know it was a freak accident.

763
00:40:55,695 --> 00:40:58,662
But I feel like crap, and
she's dead because of me.

764
00:41:01,142 --> 00:41:02,487
I don't blame you.

765
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:06,676
I wanted to. I tried to.

766
00:41:06,908 --> 00:41:10,770
I must have reviewed Amber's case file
100 times to find a way.

767
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:14,199
But it wasn't your fault.

768
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:19,480
Then we're okay?

769
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:22,975
I mean, I know you're not, but...

770
00:41:25,808 --> 00:41:27,810
- Maybe I can help.
- We're not okay.

771
00:41:30,027 --> 00:41:32,357
Amber was never the reason
I was leaving.

772
00:41:33,311 --> 00:41:34,966
I didn't want to tell you because...

773
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:40,734
Because I was trying...

774
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,671
Like I always do, to protect you.

775
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:47,105
Which is the problem.

776
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:52,430
You spread misery because
you can't feel anything else.

777
00:41:52,797 --> 00:41:55,016
You manipulate people
because you can't handle

778
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:57,977
any kind of real relationship.
And I've enabled it.

779
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,842
For years.

780
00:41:59,962 --> 00:42:03,525
The games, the binges,
the middle-of-the-night phone calls.

781
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,775
I should have been
the one on the bus, not...

782
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:15,208
You should have been alone on the bus.

783
00:42:17,073 --> 00:42:20,291
If I've learned anything from Amber,
it's that I have to take care of myself.

784
00:42:26,206 --> 00:42:27,966
We're not friends anymore, House.

785
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,403
I'm not sure we ever were.
