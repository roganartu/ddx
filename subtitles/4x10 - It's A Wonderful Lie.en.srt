1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,139
You okay?

2
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,368
I'm thinking.

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,341
Thinking's not gonna get you to the top.

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,809
Mom, you're supposed
to be encouraging me.

5
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,642
No, I'm supposed to be coaching you.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,511
The slower you go, the
more tired you're gonna get.

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,025
There's a hold about a
foot above you on the left.

8
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,389
I know.

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,829
Nice grab!

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,459
Keep going. You're almost there, babe.

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,832
I can't. My calf's cramping.

12
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,063
You need to get off your toes.

13
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,798
Get on the ball of your foot. I can't.

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,899
Yes, you can. You can get
all the way to the top.

15
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,049
It's okay. I got you. You all right?

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,812
Looks like you were wrong. Yeah.

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,820
But you did awesome. That's
the highest you've gotten.

18
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,014
I'm proud of you.

19
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,147
I don't feel so good.

20
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,054
Okay. Come on down.

21
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,653
Mom?

22
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,588
Mom, are you okay?

23
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,403
Oh, my God.

24
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,739
Whoa! Did you see that? You all right?

25
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,574
My arm. I think I broke it. Don't move.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,908
Oh, Jane, I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,107
What happened? Did the rope break?

28
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:27,118
No. My hands, I can't move them.

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,249
She's been to an ortho, two
neuros and an immunologist.

30
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,296
None of the treatments
have had any effect.

31
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,024
You think it's over? It's getting worse.

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,464
Last neurologist found
intermittent numbness in both arms

33
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,762
as well as the hand paralysis.

34
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,030
I meant the game. You think
he's gonna keep all four of us?

35
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,107
He said he would. No sign of
upper motor neuron involvement.

36
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,334
He lies.

37
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,875
My ears are burning.

38
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,172
Tell him you're done firing people.

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,511
Well, if I lie, that would
be little reassurance.

40
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,848
Dr. Kutner, who told you
that it would be a good idea

41
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,389
to put up superficial representations
of a hypocritical season

42
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,515
celebrating a mythical figure?

43
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,650
It wasn't me.

44
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,853
He lied.

45
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,730
Homey knows better, Hymie doesn't care,

46
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,027
and Huntington's would
have done a better job.

47
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,396
I don't have Huntington's.

48
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,833
That you know of. Why would you...

49
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,032
Because I got sued when I
called you "honey buns. "

50
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,300
Am I fired if I put up...

51
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,774
The point of the game was to scare us.

52
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,401
Telling us it's over isn't scary.

53
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,742
Therefore, he has no reason
to say that unless it's true.

54
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,214
Good. Then, can we do a Secret Santa?

55
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:10,080
I liked you better 15 seconds ago
when you were afraid for your job.

56
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,214
So, who's sick?

57
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,849
35-year-old
single mom.

58
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,553
It's an odd presentation of paralysis.

59
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,322
Is there any history of drug use? No.

60
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,125
She says there's no history.

61
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,859
She's not a liar.

62
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,026
Okay. This is gonna be a tough case.

63
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,934
I have almost no knowledge
of alien physiology.

64
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,438
Everyone lies. But there's
an exception to every rule.

65
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,565
Actually, there isn't. That's
kind of what makes it a rule.

66
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,769
The patient's mother died of
breast cancer when she was seven.

67
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,368
She never even knew her mom was sick.

68
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,711
She promised herself she would never
hide anything from her own daughter.

69
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,843
Oh. I didn't know she'd promised.

70
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,046
And we're not her daughter.

71
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,521
The patient inherited the
BRCA1 mutation from her mom.

72
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,923
She had a prophylactic double
mastectomy 10 years ago.

73
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,995
She lied about it. She told her
co-workers. She told her kid.

74
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,394
She lied to the world.

75
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,898
Reconstructive surgery is
designed to convince people that...

76
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,696
She didn't get reconstructive surgery.

77
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,461
Okay. We can rule out breast cancer.

78
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,597
Actually, I was gonna rule it in.
Paralysis could be paraneoplastic.

79
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,575
Even the best surgeon can't
remove every cell of breast tissue.

80
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:12,048
MRI what's left of her chest.
Set the machine to scan for irony.

81
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,177
I'm gonna go re-do the patient history.

82
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,960
Your mom tell you about
all the drugs she does?

83
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,429
She smokes pot once in a
while, but not in a long time.

84
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,557
What about you?

85
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,965
How would that make her sick?

86
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,330
Are you a doctor?

87
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,734
I'm 11.

88
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,836
That's not an answer. That's an evasion.

89
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,069
Drinking? You ever sneak a drink?

90
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,137
I don't do any of that
stuff. It's bad for you.

91
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,012
I understand why you don't
want your mom to know.

92
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,142
But I'm her doctor, so...

93
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,516
No, I would tell my mom.

94
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,645
And I would tell you. Why?

95
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,991
Because she would never lie to me.

96
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,420
What's her favorite way to have sex?

97
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,962
I don't get what sex has
to do with breast cancer.

98
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,227
Are you a doctor?

99
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,966
Did you go to med school
since the last time I asked?

100
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,664
You just think we've
got to be lying to...

101
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,296
White lies? What are those?

102
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,342
Those are lies we tell to
make other people feel better.

103
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,603
I don't lie.

104
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,703
Rationalizations? What are those?

105
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,940
Those are lies we tell to
make ourselves feel better.

106
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,073
No. We don't...

107
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,276
Lies of omission?

108
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,113
Saddle, bronc or doggie?

109
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,884
That's sex talk.

110
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:32,287
She used to like being on top, but
now she likes to be on her stomach.

111
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,999
That way she doesn't have to
see them looking at her scars.

112
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,210
It's child abuse.

113
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,747
Honesty?

114
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,908
There's a reason that
everybody lies. It works.

115
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,576
It's what allows society to function.

116
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,120
It's what separates man from beast.

117
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,212
Oh, I thought that was our thumbs.

118
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,917
You want to know every place
your mom's thumb has been?

119
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,892
I'm sorry. I missed rehearsal. Am
I taking the truth-is-good side?

120
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,156
Don't you usually take that part?

121
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,697
Lies are a tool.

122
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,392
They can be used either for good...

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,627
Wait. I've got a better one.

124
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,033
Lies are like children.

125
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,164
They're hard work but they're worth
it because the future depends on them.

126
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,800
You are so full of love or something.

127
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,412
When you care about someone...

128
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,972
You lie to them.

129
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,541
You pretend that their constant,
ponderous musings are interesting.

130
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,815
You tell them they're not
losing their boyish good looks

131
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:30,980
or becoming worn out and...

132
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,582
I stand corrected. And may I say it's
been a real pleasure chatting with you.

133
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,128
Axilla is clean. Surgical
margins look clear.

134
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,223
No lymphadenopathy, no masses,
no nothing. It's not cancer.

135
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,102
We need a new theory.

136
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,159
You catch her lying?

137
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,262
Not yet.

138
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,000
Wouldn't no have been a shorter answer?

139
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,099
Wouldn't you not talking have
made this a shorter conversation?

140
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,474
Kid says Mom's a slut.

141
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,569
She called her mom a slut?

142
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,908
No. I called her mom a slut.

143
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,108
She jumps anything
with a pole and a pulse.

144
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,175
Not that I'm judging, here. Given her
medical history, I'm actually impressed.

145
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,312
Maggie already admitted to
having multiple sexual partners.

146
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,413
Which is why we already
tested for, and ruled out,

147
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,754
syphilis and any other STD that
could have caused her symptoms.

148
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,590
STDs aren't the only risk in risky sex.

149
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,631
The problem in sleeping with
strangers is, they're strange.

150
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,359
We'll follow up with
any recent partners.

151
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,129
Send Foreman and Taub.
They're better liars.

152
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,034
More likely to get to the truth.

153
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,474
You think I drugged her? Use a coaster.

154
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,279
We're not cops. Legally, we
don't care one way or another.

155
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,012
But we need to know the
truth so we can help her.

156
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,714
I'd known her for less than an hour
and she offered to take me home.

157
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,347
There was no need to drug her.

158
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,055
Not that I would.

159
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,196
She's gonna be okay, right?

160
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,529
As long as she doesn't have to
pick up or hold anything, yeah.

161
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,001
Sorry. I just had the
floors done. Reclaimed pine.

162
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,105
You always this thirsty?

163
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,043
I don't know.

164
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,205
Water's supposed to
be good for you, right?

165
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,974
Dehydration, anxiety, aggression.

166
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,484
I'm not aggressive.

167
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,520
Spastic chorea in his right hand.

168
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,849
What about my hand?
How much do you weigh?

169
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,823
About 180, 190? 180. What is this?

170
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,224
If you took what she did, it
could take longer to hit you.

171
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,057
It might affect you differently.

172
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,324
But you didn't give her anything, right?

173
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,328
She was really drunk.

174
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,236
I just gave her some E
to help enhance things.

175
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,171
Have any of it left?

176
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,933
Is my hand gonna be okay?

177
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,002
There's nothing wrong with it.

178
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,411
We lied.

179
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,187
I've had a sore throat
for a few days now.

180
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,247
My stomach's also been bothering me.

181
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,690
I think my glands are swollen.

182
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,523
Saint Nicholas?

183
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,028
Patron saint of children.

184
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:57,035
Also seamen, merchants, archers,
prostitutes and prisoners.

185
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,765
Mmm. He must have been
pretty hard working.

186
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,238
Or just a credit hog.

187
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,605
Open wide.

188
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,211
Say, "Ah. " Ah.

189
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,608
You have strep.

190
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,579
Is it contagious?

191
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,051
Only for the next 24 hours, as
long as you take the antibiotics.

192
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,382
How contagious?

193
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,283
Take a personal day.

194
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,721
I can't.

195
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,617
I'll write your pimp a note.

196
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,888
My pimp?

197
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,055
You get tested for
AIDS every three months.

198
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,826
And your necklace.

199
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,094
Prostitutes wear religious symbols?

200
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,363
I think they just like kneeling.

201
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,669
You don't have the skin of a
seaman, the fingers of an archer,

202
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,175
the clothes of a merchant
or the attitude of an ex-con.

203
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,676
So, that just leaves one left.

204
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,713
Mmm, two, actually.

205
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,110
But I'm not a child, am I?

206
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,392
You owe me 50 bucks.

207
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,126
Then you owe me half a lap dance.

208
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,965
It's for the nurses' holiday
bonus. I know you got the memo.

209
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,473
I got the memo last year. I
want to hire 40 more fellows.

210
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,133
You already fired the ones you hired?

211
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,676
They work better when they're scared.

212
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,644
You were right. Guy slipped her Ecstasy.

213
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,678
He have any symptoms? No.

214
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,649
Kutner's starting the
patient on hemodialysis,

215
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,711
and Thirteen's in the lab trying to
figure out what the guy put in the drugs.

216
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,854
See? Clear, simple statement of facts

217
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,418
describing their cooperation with
absolutely no attitude or fear.

218
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,928
Something's got to be done.

219
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,329
Oh, yeah.

220
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,092
How are you feeling?

221
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,568
I still can't move my hands.

222
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:42,004
It will take a few more hours to cycle
all your blood through the machine.

223
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,871
What just happened?

224
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,176
Nothing. What's wrong?

225
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,110
What do you mean? The
lights just went out.

226
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,213
Didn't they?

227
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,672
What did you do?

228
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,843
Is this from the drugs?

229
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,510
Most of the drugs should be
out of your system by now.

230
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,713
And our drugs wouldn't... I can't see.

231
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,880
Do something!

232
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,082
I can't see!

233
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,592
I can't see!

234
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,465
Nothing in the Ecstasy except Ecstasy.

235
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,432
Well, that never hurt anybody.

236
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,630
Can't make them blind days later.

237
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,729
Do you spell "Homey" with a "Y"?

238
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,475
I want to be respectful.

239
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,043
You're actually gonna
let us do Secret Santa?

240
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,908
Not just you guys.

241
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,880
I like presents, too.

242
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,582
Pick a name.

243
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:27,744
Why are you doing this?

244
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,311
See, this is why no
one likes your people.

245
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:34,154
The notion of picking one time of the year
to be decent to other people is obscene

246
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,659
'cause it's actually
validating the notion

247
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,456
of being miserable wretches
the rest of the year.

248
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,656
So, you think this is the part
of the year that's screwed up?

249
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,297
On the other hand, you are now a
team. You've got to work together.

250
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,893
And the simple fact is, giving
people crap makes people like people.

251
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,496
So, spend 25 bucks. Learn to love.

252
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,571
Blindness could be a complication
from the hemodialysis.

253
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,511
No, the dialysate
composition was within range.

254
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,305
Sweet. Interesting.

255
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,475
The dialysate composition just
indicates... Indicates nothing.

256
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,212
I was referring to his
reaction to the name he got.

257
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,684
I was pleased. I thought
it'd be fun to buy for...

258
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,849
Means there's someone here
it wouldn't be fun to buy for.

259
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,621
I wonder who. Pick a name.

260
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:14,792
Then go check out the patient's house.

261
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,859
Interesting.

262
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,801
We're wasting time going to the home.

263
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,771
Kearns-Sayre Syndrome
fits the symptoms.

264
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,967
No family history of
Kearns. Go to their house.

265
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,374
She would have told us if there
were any other drugs. You met her.

266
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,446
She couldn't have been more
candid. You're absolutely right.

267
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,004
Go to their house... MS or a
vascular problem fits better.

268
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,777
They could affect hands and eyes.

269
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,047
Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS.

270
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,555
And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes
to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.

271
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:42,218
Oh, and whoever goes to their
house, get me their computers.

272
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,489
You talk to your kid about sex

273
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,554
so she'll think you're
being open about everything.

274
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,498
It keeps her from asking questions about
things you don't want to talk about.

275
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,503
That's right. Her honesty
proves just how dishonest she is.

276
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,564
Yes! Exactly who I wanted.
This is gonna be fun.

277
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,244
The dye may sting when it
enters your bloodstream.

278
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,978
Are you scared, Mom?

279
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,383
Yeah.

280
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,045
Are you? Yeah.

281
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:11,714
Are they?

282
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,218
They don't look scared.

283
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,591
Either they're confident
or they just don't care.

284
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,223
We're confident.

285
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,095
Okay if I shift you a bit? I
need to get you into position.

286
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,576
Your boss is weird.

287
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,475
Yeah, he is.

288
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,209
He thought he'd get information you
may not have been telling us by...

289
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,614
Being a jerk?

290
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,675
You'd be surprised how often it works.

291
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,015
Choroidal flush looks good.

292
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,423
Why would people lie to a doctor?

293
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,084
Dozens of reasons to lie. Only
one reason to tell the truth.

294
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,754
You're never even tempted?

295
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:56,091
I mean, lies do sometimes smooth
things out, make life easier.

296
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,534
Yeah? Your life easy?

297
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,632
Not even close.

298
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,774
Dye's reached the retinal
capillary bed. No leakage.

299
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,745
That's good, right?

300
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,539
It means it's not a vascular problem.

301
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,380
But? A vascular problem we could fix.

302
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,418
They look worried now, Mom.

303
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,260
What's with the Secret Santa?

304
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,821
You trying to bring them together?

305
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,230
Want to drive them apart.

306
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,330
With gift giving?

307
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,926
Conflict's built right into the name.

308
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,938
Santa's about sharing.
Secret's about withholding.

309
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,572
Aside from the Trojan
horse, gifts don't usually...

310
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:42,171
What did you get your wife
for your final anniversary?

311
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,272
Uh, a sweater. She hated it.

312
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,612
She loved it.

313
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,083
Then you didn't buy it.

314
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,952
I gave her some cash and...

315
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,986
Gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly
how little we know about a person.

316
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,892
And nothing pisses off a person more

317
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,521
than being shoved in
the wrong pigeonhole.

318
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,759
Nice.

319
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,670
I'm thinking of spending a few
extra bucks on my Secret Santa.

320
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,829
Bad idea.

321
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,635
You mind if I tell House you asked
them for the key instead of breaking in?

322
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,006
Yes. I do. Just another
5 bucks. 5 will be 10.

323
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,703
The key's proof she doesn't
have anything to hide.

324
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,212
The key is proof I didn't do
exactly what House told me to do.

325
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,680
And what do you care if it's another 15?

326
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,910
I'm gonna tell him. Who are
you so anxious to please?

327
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,782
Not you.

328
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,186
You really think you're gonna
prove people are capable of honesty

329
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,315
using a mother and daughter
you've known for one day?

330
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,020
I'm not the one who's based his
entire worldview on the proposition.

331
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,892
If I'm wrong, so what? If he's wrong...

332
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,957
So, you've got Huntington's? Nope.

333
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,162
But House said that...

334
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,205
If I wanted to talk about
it, why didn't I bring it up?

335
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,637
Fluorescein angiogram was
clear. No leaks. No lesions.

336
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,145
Definitely not a vascular problem.

337
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,639
Someone get their
birthdays out of the file.

338
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,844
Have you tried leaving it blank?

339
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,551
Tough to get into the head of someone
who actually trusts people, huh?

340
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:04,257
Found both computers in an
office on a desk they share.

341
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,695
No sign of macular
degeneration or optic neuritis.

342
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,027
Her eyes are completely normal.

343
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,863
Except she can't see out of them.

344
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,062
So she says.

345
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,536
You find anything on the MRI?

346
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,402
No sign of plaques. It's not MS.

347
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,498
We haven't found anything
abnormal on any tests.

348
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,100
Except she can't see or move her hands.

349
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,236
So she says.

350
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,473
You can't lie about flaccid paralysis.

351
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,874
Maybe she's not lying. Her brain is.

352
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,216
What if it's a conversion disorder?

353
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,188
Lacks personal boundaries.

354
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,857
Promiscuous. Inappropriate
obsession with truth telling.

355
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,726
Certainly sounds like a psych case.

356
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,962
Cool. I'll set up a psych consult
and start her on anti-depressants.

357
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,296
No.

358
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,266
Her mind is tricking her body.

359
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,906
We need to trick her mind.

360
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,241
Or even better...

361
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,274
You don't need her. I know.

362
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,182
Then this serves no medical purpose.

363
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,120
You have a genetic defect,
choose to ignore it.

364
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,884
This woman has a genetic defect,

365
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,186
chooses to butcher herself to be safe.

366
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,923
Yet, what you claim to be
fascinated by is her honesty.

367
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,225
Interesting.

368
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,232
You claim to want the truth.

369
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,360
And then you screw with people
who actually live by it. Pathetic.

370
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,235
Hey, I gave you credit for interesting.

371
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,707
You're protecting her because you're
jealous she did what you couldn't.

372
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,811
I need you.

373
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,110
I'm not lying to her.

374
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,378
Fine. Keep your mouth
shut. I still need you.

375
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,886
If it doesn't work, you've
got to hold the kid down

376
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,922
until someone else
finishes lying to Mom.

377
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,622
That does actually
serve a medical purpose.

378
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,759
Jane.

379
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,433
I have to lie because she trusts me?

380
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:55,405
If you show doubt, the
placebo treatment won't work.

381
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,170
If it's just depression,
that's good news, right?

382
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,505
There are a lot of great medications.

383
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,944
Why can't we just give her those?
Why do we have to lie to her?

384
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,449
Because we might be wrong.

385
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:09,977
Those medications take a long time to work,
and since your mom's condition's declining,

386
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,990
there's a chance the drugs won't
tell us anything until it's too late.

387
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,521
My mom's not depressed.

388
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,220
Maybe she's hiding it from you.

389
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,696
No.

390
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:20,787
She wouldn't.

391
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,094
She's doing what every good mom does.

392
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,136
Protecting her child from bad news
that she can't do anything about.

393
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,671
My mom's never lied to me.

394
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,103
If you don't know how to lie,

395
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,235
you don't know how to tell
when you're being lied to.

396
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,845
Maybe you're right.

397
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,383
I know I'm... I was lying.

398
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,917
I know how to lie.

399
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,554
I just won't do it to my mother.

400
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,226
You like foosball?

401
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,228
Until the treatment of your
infectious paraparesis takes effect,

402
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,861
Jane can't come back into the room.

403
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,234
I've already been inoculated.

404
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,807
Can she have it already?

405
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,036
Don't worry. It's a
very effective treatment.

406
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,669
You should be feeling better
in a matter of minutes.

407
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,077
Don't you think Jane
deserves a few secrets?

408
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,086
Some personal space?

409
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,180
Room to make her own mistakes?

410
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,726
She makes plenty of mistakes.

411
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,886
Only difference is I'm there
to help her through them.

412
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,430
But she's got to know you're
looking over her shoulder.

413
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,726
It's got to stifle her.

414
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,096
I think the world
would be a better place

415
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,432
if everybody always acted like their
mom was looking over their shoulder.

416
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,239
I want to go see my mom.

417
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,342
She's sleeping.

418
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,909
Why don't we just double
the amount we can spend?

419
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,784
Nope. Can't afford another 25?

420
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,016
If we allow people 50,
people will spend 60.

421
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,718
Ah! So, you can't afford another 35.

422
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,193
You must really like who
you got. Or really dislike.

423
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,455
My mom always gives the best presents

424
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,228
to the teachers I get
along with the worst.

425
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,235
No. No.

426
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,470
How do you know no?

427
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,443
I know you didn't get House.

428
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,646
I know he didn't get House.

429
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,212
You gave them all your name? Mmm-hmm.

430
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:25,450
I figured I could sow some dissension
and get a few ties and sweaters.

431
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,184
What happens when they find out?

432
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,726
It's Secret Santa.

433
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,153
What happens when they find out?

434
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,960
They'll argue about what
to do with that information.

435
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,262
The ties are less important
than the dissension.

436
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,395
We still have to buy him
something. Not a chance.

437
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,598
We weren't supposed to discuss
this. We're not supposed to know.

438
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,903
He's not supposed to put
his name in there five times.

439
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,376
He wants presents. It's sad.

440
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,276
It's pathetic.

441
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,542
I'm still buying him a present.

442
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,243
No, you're not.

443
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,013
Fine.

444
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,924
What's wrong?

445
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,295
I think it's getting worse.

446
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,496
I can't breathe.

447
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,593
I need a nurse in here!

448
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,234
Her lymph nodes are cutting off
her airway. We've got to intubate!

449
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,884
The swollen lymph nodes were
cutting off Maggie's airway.

450
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,119
We shrunk them with alcohol and
she's breathing on her own now.

451
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,526
Well, that sucks.

452
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,895
Four thousand, three
hundred saved emails

453
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,992
and not a single mention of
"lesbionic," "Sanchez," or "mangina. "

454
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,402
Swollen lymph nodes means
it wasn't psychological.

455
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,596
Who's that from?

456
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,734
Santa, obviously. As
you know, I worship him.

457
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:56,211
Oh, wait. I meant Satan.
I always get them confused.

458
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:01,717
What is an "alpine butterfly"? And
why is she learning how to do one?

459
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,312
House, we already have a full history.
You don't need to waste time...

460
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,380
It's just a climbing knot.
But what does she use it for?

461
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,982
Try "bondage. " I did once.

462
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,827
But she just tied me down and whined about
how hard it is to be Dean of Medicine.

463
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,994
Gyms aren't exactly pristine. Could be a
fungal infection. Seriously, who's it from?

464
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,229
No fever. No elevated white count.

465
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,007
That's funny. Friend sent
her a Garfield cartoon.

466
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,009
That cat sure does love lasagna.

467
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,103
House, stop obsessing.

468
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,584
If it weren't for my obsessions, we
wouldn't know that she has sarcoidosis.

469
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,516
Eighteen months ago,
she sold her Stairmaster.

470
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,749
It was only two months old.

471
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,759
Now, either she needed the cash, or
climbing stairs was getting more difficult.

472
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,092
Twelve months ago, she
canceled a hiking trip.

473
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,359
Now, either she just wanted
to sit home and watch TV,

474
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,230
or walking was getting more difficult.

475
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,567
She's been suffering joint
pain for the last two years.

476
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,106
Pull my ribbon. If you know what I mean.

477
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,699
ACE levels are too low for sarcoidosis.

478
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,345
That's not what I meant.

479
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,173
Could just be an inactive phase.

480
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,340
It's not Christmas yet.

481
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,611
I remembered. I'm not
a Satanist. I'm a Druid.

482
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,049
No lung involvement. Yet.

483
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,281
We'll need a bronchoalveolar
lavage to confirm it.

484
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,485
That's a shame. I was gonna
surprise her with one for Christmas.

485
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,760
Wow!

486
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,921
Now, either that cost
more than 25 bucks,

487
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,435
or I'm seriously starting to doubt
Steve Jobs' business strategies.

488
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,234
Thanks!

489
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:33,407
Last round of saline,
Maggie. One more big breath.

490
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,914
You've got to get the liquid to go
all the way into your lungs, okay?

491
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,449
Here we go.

492
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,583
The gift could be from a patient.

493
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,281
Who sent it to the wrong doctor?

494
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,153
House obviously gave
the present to himself.

495
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,292
They're arguing right now.

496
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,924
I've been looking for this all morning.

497
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,764
Did you look in the box on my desk?

498
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,202
Oh, by the way, your mom
called. Your dad's dead.

499
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,464
You left the present
sitting on your desk?

500
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,204
It wouldn't have been as effective
sitting in a closet in my home.

501
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,505
They're gonna know it's from you. No.

502
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,273
They're gonna guess that it was from me.

503
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,974
They might even be 90%
sure that it was from me.

504
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,517
But all that means is
they're 10% percent sure

505
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,643
that one of the other
guys is screwing them over.

506
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,382
Have you ever considered
channeling your powers to,

507
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,119
I don't know, bring
peace to the Mid-east?

508
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,559
I couldn't do that.

509
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,493
But if they ever got it,
you could screw it up.

510
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,192
Yeah. That's more where my powers lie.

511
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,793
The gift could be from
Wilson. It's House.

512
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,530
Why do you have a problem
with him speculating?

513
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,935
Because that's what
House wants us to do.

514
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,534
Lungs are pristine. No
infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage.

515
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,669
Maggie, I'm gonna remove the scope.
I need you to cough for me, okay?

516
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,003
A little harder.

517
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:46,981
Great.

518
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,989
Maggie? Open your eyes.

519
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,861
Why aren't you saying anything?

520
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,258
What's wrong?

521
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,595
Maggie tested negative for sarcoidosis.

522
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,197
But she's bleeding into her eyes, now.

523
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,572
Have her platelets dropped?

524
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,440
Plummeted. New labs
show they're under 40.

525
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,503
She'll bleed out of every orifice
if we don't find the cause.

526
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,741
Could be splenic
sequestration, tuberculosis.

527
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,215
Gaucher disease, TTP.

528
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,184
Hemolytic-uremic
syndrome, sepsis, lupus...

529
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,778
Listing all the possible
causes is only impressive

530
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,914
if you can do it reverse alphabetically.

531
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,458
We need to know why her
platelet machine is broken.

532
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,723
Go to the factory. Do a
bone marrow aspiration.

533
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,241
I'm your Secret Santa.

534
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,767
You're not supposed to tell.

535
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,436
But you got a present already,

536
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,981
which means you have more
than one Secret Santa.

537
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,983
Or somebody else wants to make me happy.

538
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,816
Merry Christmas.

539
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,466
On the one hand, you should be in bed.

540
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,173
On the other hand, I told you
to rest. So, I see your dilemma.

541
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,943
Hey, I don't think
resting is the problem.

542
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,349
Can strep cause this?

543
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,647
Clap on.

544
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,622
Trust me, first place I went.

545
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,856
No rash on my labia. Do
you need to take a look?

546
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,854
I'm saving my money
for a Red Rider BB gun.

547
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,295
Darker shade of lipstick?

548
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,928
I'm not wearing any.

549
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,335
You tell your mother what you do?

550
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,107
It doesn't matter. I'm curious.

551
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,813
I don't need to break her heart
just so I can feel righteous.

552
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,525
Do you do a donkey show?

553
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,993
I'm not curious. It matters.

554
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,065
It's a donkey or a mule.

555
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,835
I can never remember.

556
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,470
Wow. That is a creepy smile.

557
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,371
I bet the donkey's is even creepier.

558
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,807
Do I have to explain... Nope.

559
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:31,641
That's my job.

560
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,149
Contagious ecthyma.

561
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:37,552
Any contact can cause rashes,
flu symptoms, sore throat.

562
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,782
Has there been

563
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,113
contact?

564
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,694
Okay. Antibiotic cream for you

565
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,264
and a love glove for Francis.

566
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,198
You'll both be fine.

567
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,137
You should come and see the
show. I think you'd like it.

568
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,900
Sorry. I hate Westerns.

569
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,987
So, they really never lie?

570
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,391
Doesn't seem like it.

571
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,553
Admirable.

572
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,653
You tell Cameron everything?

573
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,095
No.

574
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,289
You think she keeps secrets?

575
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,131
If I knew, they wouldn't
be secrets. I hope she does.

576
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,764
People have a right to a little
privacy, even from the people they love.

577
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,044
Did you buy House a present?

578
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,344
Why would I? To screw with me.

579
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,747
Then, I'm gonna say yes.

580
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,780
No, wait. Stop. Stop. What's that smell?

581
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,121
The bone is smoking.

582
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,088
Her bones are harder than the drill?

583
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,665
We ran a full body bone scan to find
the cause of hardening in the hip.

584
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,931
No hot spots anywhere.

585
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,495
Tracer could have been inactive.

586
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,165
So, I screwed up the test?

587
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,867
There are so many ways
that could have happened.

588
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,672
Maybe it was inactive, maybe
it didn't fully circulate...

589
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,007
It circulated. The camera picked up.

590
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,606
Hey, hey. It's Christmas.
Why are you guys fighting?

591
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,010
Why do you think there are no hot spots?

592
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,555
I did not screw up. The
density is consistent.

593
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:22,023
Just means the density was
consistent. Doesn't mean it was cold.

594
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,527
It's possible all she has are hot spots.

595
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,191
It's consistent because her entire
skeleton is turning to stone.

596
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,130
Good for an aspiring superhero.

597
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:36,298
Fatal for a human hoping
to make it to Kwanzaa.

598
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,842
It's got to be from a carbonic
anhydrase type 2 deficiency.

599
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,968
It has free will.

600
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,409
It doesn't have to be
anything it doesn't want to be.

601
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,073
I meant if it's not CA-2, well,

602
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,117
none of the other causes of
osteopetrosis are treatable.

603
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,682
You're right. It's got to be.

604
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:56,682
Go run her blood and hope that
your sunny optimism isn't misplaced.

605
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:08,237
They accused Kutner of screwing
up a test because they hate him.

606
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,397
You're surprised?

607
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,633
That's the sort of crap that happens

608
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,300
when you mess with people's heads.

609
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,106
One day, he will screw up a test.

610
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,382
And if they don't accuse him of that
because they like him, someone could die.

611
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:21,876
Where are we going?

612
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,386
Nowhere. I just know it hurts you.

613
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,624
CA-2 deficiency's a genetic
disorder that scrambles proteins.

614
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,255
If the blood test is positive,
you'll need a bone marrow transplant.

615
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,993
"Transplant" sounds like a
euphemism for "slim odds. "

616
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,631
Slim but not none.

617
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,867
We're gonna need to
test Jane for a match.

618
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,736
Don't you have donor banks?

619
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,073
Jane is your best bet.

620
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,080
The procedure is perfectly
safe. There's no risk.

621
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,547
No risk?

622
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,846
Any surgery has... Then,
don't tell me there's no risk.

623
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,311
You're gonna tell me
there's no pain, either?

624
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,549
The testing will hurt a little.

625
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,615
I'll be fine.

626
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:07,595
If she doesn't do this
and you don't make it,

627
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,893
she's gonna spend the rest
of her life blaming herself.

628
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,436
Mom, please.

629
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,808
Find someone else.

630
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,041
Let someone else take the risk.

631
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,292
Donor bank turned up a
49-year-old man in Cleveland

632
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,297
who's a five out of six HLA match.

633
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,662
First flight out of
Cleveland leaves at...

634
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:45,202
Why is a 49-year-old Cleveland man
a closer match than her daughter?

635
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,771
He may not be. Maggie
didn't let us test her.

636
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,828
Why not?

637
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,534
Pain, danger, risk of...

638
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,303
Only reason to give multiple reasons

639
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,675
is you're searching for what
the person wants to hear.

640
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,646
House.

641
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,987
You're wrong about sainted Mommy.

642
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:13,861
Don't care. You can forget the donor
bank. There's no CA-2 deficiency.

643
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,523
Best we can do is make her comfortable.

644
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,801
Is that from Taub?

645
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,632
Yes.

646
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,573
Yes, it is.

647
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,307
Merry Christmas.

648
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,747
Who's gonna tell the
patient she's dying?

649
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,015
I will.

650
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,924
And nobody leaves here until
we find out what killed her.

651
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,364
Whatever she has is fatal.

652
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,927
Makes no difference if it's
disease number 58 or 907.

653
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,240
Are you guys mad at me?

654
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,743
No. You had no choice.

655
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,245
Of course I had a choice. You had
no choice once I made my choice.

656
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,509
And now, I'm choosing
not to be mad at you.

657
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,572
Why?

658
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,948
Because it will drive House nuts.

659
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,182
Do you think that will make
your lives better or worse?

660
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,759
I told my mom I don't
care what she thinks.

661
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,588
I want you to test my marrow.

662
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,762
I can't be dying.

663
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:28,896
Sure you can.

664
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,235
You're wrong.

665
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,808
You don't even know what I have.

666
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,869
What you have is one last
Christmas with your daughter.

667
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,882
One last chance to give her a present.

668
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,250
The truth.

669
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,221
It's inexpensive, highly valued.

670
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,883
Never have to stand in line to
return it the day after Christmas.

671
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,551
What are you talking about?

672
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,258
A mother who's going to die

673
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,390
doesn't refuse a donor
test because it might hurt.

674
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,458
She refuses when she
knows it won't match.

675
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,830
Which tends to happen

676
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,396
when mother and daughter
aren't mother and daughter.

677
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,274
I can do DNA tests if you'd
rather keep lying to me.

678
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,655
I never wanted kids.

679
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:27,022
I loved them, but with my genes...

680
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,430
I knew this woman, a drug addict.

681
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,337
She got pregnant, didn't
want to have an abortion.

682
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,802
But she also didn't want her daughter
to ever know who her real mother was.

683
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,004
What she was.

684
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,009
I promised never to tell.

685
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,857
A promise to an addict is worth
more than a promise to your daughter?

686
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,690
It'd be cruel to tell her.

687
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:02,789
Right. She lives a lie.
You get to die a hypocrite.

688
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,868
Mom? The doctors told
me what's happening.

689
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,205
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

690
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,573
I promise you.

691
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,872
Doctors can be wrong.

692
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,346
There's still a chance I can beat...

693
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,351
You really believe that?

694
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,551
I do.

695
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,362
No, Mom. You're dying.

696
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,331
Nobody can help you.

697
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,728
It's not gonna be okay.

698
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,155
That was cold.

699
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,559
Yeah.

700
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,986
What did you get for Christmas?

701
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,681
I got a watch, a vintage LP,

702
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,248
and a second edition Conan Doyle.

703
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,521
And if that wasn't bad
enough, my patient's dying.

704
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,723
Christmas deaths in a hospital.
There's nothing more depressing.

705
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,790
No one ever wants to go
in the patient's room.

706
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,802
Even the candy stripers
leave them alone.

707
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,762
But I saw something amazing.

708
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,066
Pure truth.

709
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,512
She told her mother that she was dying.

710
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,309
Stripped her of all hope.

711
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,651
That sounds horrible.

712
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:04,812
It was like watching some
bizarre astronomical event

713
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,514
that you know you're
never gonna see again.

714
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,617
You tell people the cold, hard truth
all the time. You get off on it.

715
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,026
Because I don't care.

716
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,358
She cared.

717
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,924
And she did it, anyway.

718
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,432
She did it because she cared.

719
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:25,301
The angels of Christmas have finally
given House a present he can appreciate.

720
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,468
Oh, don't ruin it.

721
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,035
Don't pin this on Christ.
He's got enough nails in him.

722
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,273
Patient had to die...

723
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,610
Why don't you take off that hat?

724
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,775
It's Christmas. It's a reindeer.

725
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,978
It's a moose, on a Jew.

726
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,452
Who cares?

727
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,287
Things have their place.

728
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,158
You wouldn't hang dreidels
from a Christmas tree.

729
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,628
You could.

730
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,461
Things don't care.

731
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,870
No, they don't.

732
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,668
Happy solstice, House.

733
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,475
<i>God rest ye merry gentlemen</i>

734
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,983
<i>Let nothing you dismay</i>

735
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,044
<i>Remember, Christ, our savior</i>

736
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,555
<i>Was born on Christmas day</i>

737
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,990
<i>To save us all from Satan's power</i>

738
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,927
<i>When we were gone astray</i>

739
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,895
Have you people no holiday spirit?

740
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,693
Bring me the eggnog of good cheer.

741
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,564
House, if you have
something to say, say it.

742
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,899
If you don't, give us a chance
to get home before Santa.

743
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,494
Scrooge.

744
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:29,800
Give the patient risperidone.

745
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,372
That's an anti-psychotic.
She's dying. She's not crazy.

746
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,777
I am gonna perform a Christmas miracle.

747
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:41,648
<i>Oh, tidings of comfort
and joy Comfort and joy</i>

748
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,879
You said all the other causes
of osteopetrosis are fatal.

749
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,687
Except for the one we discounted
early because it was impossible.

750
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,729
When a fetus forms, it's
just a mass of cells.

751
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,064
<i>Breast tissue covers
extensive portions of the body.</i>

752
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:00,535
As the fetus develops,
most of this tissue recedes

753
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,232
remaining only in the fun places.

754
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,400
But sometimes, extra breast tissue

755
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,036
<i>is left behind in places
where it doesn't belong.</i>

756
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,808
Risperidone does a lot of things.

757
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,749
One is it makes breast tissue
swell so we can find it more easily.

758
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,549
You're telling me I
could have breast cancer?

759
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,714
Somewhere not in my breasts?
That doesn't make sense.

760
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,725
Taub's parents have a
winter condo in Florida.

761
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:23,953
They're still New Yorkers.

762
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,528
Actually, my parents... Don't care.

763
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,991
I told a parable.

764
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,562
Now, I'm gonna raise the dead.

765
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,032
Give me that syringe.

766
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,562
That's got to be a fat deposit.

767
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,301
Yes, I could be wrong.

768
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,003
If I am, she's dead. So, shut up.

769
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:47,910
What's that?

770
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,920
Risperidone also causes galactorrhea.

771
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,421
What's that? Galactic?

772
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,659
Open your mouth.

773
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,789
Relax. You've had it before.

774
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:00,956
I am not...

775
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,529
Milk?

776
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,692
Ew!

777
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,968
We'll cut out your mom's
tumor and start her on chemo.

778
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,078
All the rest of your
symptoms should go away.

779
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,821
I love you.

780
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,653
I know.

781
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,035
Have a wonderful life.
