00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,180
So, you got a Green Beret,
a Navy SEAL
and a sister from Brooklyn.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,220
The general hands
each of them a gun and says,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,500
"Your spouse
is seated next door
in a room in a chair.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,940
"In order to pass this test,
you must go inside
and kill them."

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,700
Lmmediately
the Green Beret says,

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,340
"No, sir,
I could never kill my wife.
I just can't do it."

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,380
The General looks at him
and says, "You know what?

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,580
"You ain't got what it takes.
Take your wife
and go on home."

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,780
Navy Seal then heads in.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,620
Five minutes later, comes out,
tears strolling down his face.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,700
"I tried, I tried, I tried,
I just can't do it,

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,980
"she looked so beautiful
in the chair,
I can't do it."

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,820
General looks at him and says,
"You know what?

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,300
"You ain't got what it takes."

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,580
Finally, sister from Brooklyn
strolls in with a swagger.

00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,340
there's banging,
there's screaming,
it's going crazy!

19
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,780
Suddenly,
everything goes silent.

The General says,
"Well, what the hell
happened inside?"

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,060
The sister from Brooklyn
screams back,

"The damn gun
had blanks in it,

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,380
"so I had to beat him to death
with my bare..."

24
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,660
What the hell?

25
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,340
A little bit of warning
would have been nice!

26
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,740
The sound of a saw
cutting a hole in the wall

27
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,780
wasn't warning enough?

28
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,020

a guy get that big?

Don't look at me.

46
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,860
Please tell me
dead guys can fart.

47
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,860
Of course.
Dead bodies are full of
all sorts of gases.

48
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,260
But a dead body
can't tighten a sphincter.

49
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,980
You need a tight sphincter
to make a fart.

50
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,340
No, you need
a loose sphincter.
A tight sphincter...

51
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,980
You check his femoral?

52
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,780
No. He peed all over himself!

53
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,220
Look, I've heard dead bodies
moan, groan, hiss,

54

sit straight up on a gurney.

55
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,220
Trust me, his skin's cold,
pupils are fixed and dilated,
he's not breathing.

56
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,940
He's got a pulse!
No way.

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,820
All right, give me an Ambu bag
and an EKG.
It's thready, but it's there.

Forty-six-year-old guy

61
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,420
Doesn't appear to be
anything wrong with him

62
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,700
except for the fact
that he weighs
over 600 pounds.

63
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,140
What time
does he usually get in?

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,700
Any time between
8:00 and 10:00.

65
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,540
Did you say 600?
At least.

66
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,300
Biggest scale we got
only goes up to 350

67
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,700
but this guy's waistline
is over seven feet.

68
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,500
Which means he's a diabetic
with blood thicker
than pancake batter.

Nothing.

the speeding, DUI,

and driving
without a license.

93
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,540
The fact that you're you
explains the illegal
possession of narcotics

94

obviously thought

98
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,380
that I didn't treat him
with the deference
due to a man of his stature.

99
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,980
He trumped up a traffic stop,

Improperly prepared
puffer fish

117
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,540

Where do you think he is?

120
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,140
He's probably
at the track.

121
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,180
If he's at the track
he'd tell us
so we don't have to page him,

122
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,700
and if it was a puffer fish,
he'd be dead
in six to eight hours, tops.

123
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,180
He's been in a coma
at least 24.

124
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,060
And the guy
didn't get to 600 pounds
eating a load of sushi.

125
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,660
What if he was
in a motorcycle accident?

126
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,300

But how'd he get back in bed?

Oh, Cameron's talking

128
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,940
You ever see how he drives?

129
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
No, we haven't.

130
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,060
But I have seen
how many pills
he's been popping lately,

131
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,540
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's in a coma
somewhere himself.

132
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,580
If I am, this is
one lame hallucination.

133
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
What happened to you?

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,900

But the wall
between Wilson's office

139
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,620
and this one
is thinner than you'd think.

140
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,740
Which means
we need to stop talking

141
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,380
about what a pathetic loser
he is.

142
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,820
Start treating Jabba
for pickwickian syndrome.

143
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,780
His 96 double-Zs
are probably putting pressure
on his chest, suffocating him.

144
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,540
CO2 and oxygen
sats are normal.

145
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,060
For you and me.
What's normal
for a hippopotamus?

146
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,420
And get
a detailed medical history.

147
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,700
From who?
He was brought in alone.

148
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,060
And I doubt a guy
who weighs 600 pounds
bothers with annual physicals.

149
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,820
Talk to the neighbors
and search the house.

150
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,940
Let's see what else
Shamu's been up to
besides eating.

151
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,740
This conversation is over

152
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,300
because I've officially
run out of clever things
to call the guy.

153
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,220
It's hard to believe

154
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,780
you can even attach
this much flesh
to a human skeleton.

155
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,700
CHASE: I wouldn't exactly
call this attached.

156
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,820
This is ridiculous.

157
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,340
A person shouldn't be able to
eat themselves into oblivion

158
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,180
and then just expect everyone
to pull out the stops
to fix everything.

159
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,980
What are we supposed to do?
Refuse treatment
to anyone who's obese?

160
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,700
Come on, give me a break.
This guy's not obese.

161
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,340
He's not even morbidly obese.
He's suicidal.

162
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,980
People who attempt suicide
get treated.

163
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,900
Plenty of noncompliant
diabetics don't.

164
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,660
We don't give
drug addicts dialysis

165
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,860
or alcoholics
liver transplants.

166
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,380
What is your problem?

167
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,900

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,740
Yeah. I'm the one
with the problem.

170
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,060
So, I think
his bedroom's through there,

171
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,220
and the kitchen's
to the left.

172
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,140
Have you seen any changes
in his personality?

173
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,340
Any trouble with memory
or balance?

174
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,220
No, but I really
don't see him that often.

175
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,860
He's not unfriendly
or anything,

176
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,900
I guess he just likes
to keep to himself.

177
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,780
I think he only gave me
a spare set of keys
'cause I gave him mine.

178
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,220
What?

179
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,100
Nothing. Just reminds me
of someone I know.
Who is unfriendly.

180
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,620
Does George have a job?

181
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,740
He has a headhunting business
he runs from home.

182
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,700
Occasionally
he'll interview people here,

183
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,820
but he does most of it
over the phone.

184
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,020
Wow!

185
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,860
Yeah, he loves to cook.

186
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
And eat, obviously.

187
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,340
Four-course gourmet meals
almost every night,

188
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,580
sometimes for lunch, too.

189
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,540
Do you know if he ever uses
any unpasteurized cheese
or wild game?

190
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,700
I'm not sure.

191
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,500
He gets all his groceries
delivered from
that market down on Alden.

192
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,140
They'd probably know.

193
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,740
He have any friends?
No.

194
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,500

do come by.

195
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,580

never the same one twice,
if you know what I mean.

196
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,620
I see.

197
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,100

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,500
If I sleep on my back

I'm usually okay.

I don't know, not doing that?

205
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,100
Yeah. But it's how I sleep,
it's how I've always slept.

Well, there's always surgery.

some cartilage or something?

208

You're not sleeping
on some cartilage,
you're sleeping on your arm.

00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,100
Cuddy's looking for
a sperm donor?

234
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,340
It was a joke.
Like Cuddy
would ever want a kid.

235
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,460

Pianos and prostitutes.

246
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,540
We should do an LP
and look for neurosyphilis.

247
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,420
It's not syphilis.
How do you know?

248
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,500
Because you get STDs
from people you trust,

people you don't feel
the need to
protect yourself from.

250
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,220

is connected to his gut,
not what's below it.

251
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,940
MRI his brain,
look for clots.

252
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,820
Weight limit
on the MRI machine
is 450 pounds.

253
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,220
So do a CT.

254
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,740
Limit's 350.

255
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,300
Then just start treatment.

256
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,220
If we give him blood thinners
and the coma's caused

257
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,740
by a bleed instead of a clot,
we could kill him.

258
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,020
Either start treatment
or start building
a stronger MRI.

259
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,420
Whatever you do, do it fast.

260
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,620
The longer
he stays in the coma,

261
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,340
the less likely it is
he'll ever wake up.

262
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,500
There's no way.

263
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,220
His head's the only part
that we have to
get in the machine.

264
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,580
If we can just
get him on the table...

265
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,420
We get him on the table,
we break the table.

266
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,460
We break the table,

267
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,820
hospital's out
a million dollars
and we're out of our jobs.

268
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,980
The weight limit's
obviously just an estimation.

269
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,220
It's not like if it can hold
450 pounds fine,

270
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,380
it'll instantly collapse
under 451.

271
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,780
He's not one pound over,
he's 150 pounds over.

272
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,820
I don't care!

273
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,100
He still deserves
the same standard of care
as anyone else.

274
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,420

will stand on principle.

a lot more than that.

just some

and we missed the swelling

317
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,060

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,380
Yeah.

336
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,500
Looks like Cameron's
gonna be having
a lot more ideas in future.

337
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,300
Who knew that
being bloated and bitchy
could actually come in handy?

338
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,020
Shut up.
What if it is hormones?

339
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,340
It's not hormones.

340
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,580
I'm talking about George.

341
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,300
Acute adrenal insufficiency
could cause a temporary coma.

342
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,020
A glandular problem
would cause his temperature
to be low, not high.

343
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,340
Maybe the fever's
not related.

344
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,060
If it's not related,
there's nothing to talk about.

345
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,820
We should do
an ACTH stimulation test

346
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,780
and check his skin
for acanthosis nigricans.

347
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,940
Or the fever is related
and so are the prostitutes.

348
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,660
We should do a full STD panel
and check his genitals
for chancres.

349
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,940
CHASE: We should do nothing.

350
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,100
Just keep him a couple of days
for observation.

351
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,140
If he doesn't get any worse,

352
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,820
it was probably
just a hematoma
that dissipated on its own.

353
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,220
Or we do all of the above.

354
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,620
You check his belly
for patches.

355
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,340
You check underneath
for sores.

356
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,580
And you just sit on your ass.

357
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,980
Acanthosis nigricans
is a hyperpigmentation
of the skin,

358
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,700
usually indicates some sort
of hormonal imbalance.

359
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,660
There's nothing wrong
with my hormones.

360
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,540
It's the first thing
every doctor
I've ever gone to has checked.

361
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,300
Then it's the blood pressure,
then it's gotta be diabetes.

362
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,620
They all figure
there's gotta be
something wrong with me.

363
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,620
You having any problems
with your vision?

364
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,620
No, I have nystagmus.
I've had it since birth,
I'm fine.

365
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
You're not fine.
You were in a coma
for two days.

366
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,820
There's something wrong
with you.

367
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,900
Was something wrong with me,
now I'm better,
now I'd like to go home.

368
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,140
A coma's not like
a stomach ache.

369
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,460
You can't just shrug it off
and hope
it's not anything serious.

370
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,860
My company places
a lot of insurance executives.

371
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,820
There are over 300,000 deaths
caused each year
by medical mistakes

372
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,860
and hospital-associated
infections.
I'll come in for tests.

373
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,300
There are over 400,000 deaths
caused by
obesity-related illnesses.

374
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,860
The CDC says those figures
are a gross overestimation.

375
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,060
George, you ever notice
you don't see
a lot of obese old men?

376
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,300
If I'm gonna
have a heart attack,

377
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:21,620
I would rather it be caused
by a perfect
pan-roasted ris de veau

378
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,500
than running 26 miles
for no reason other than
to brag that I can do it.

379
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,620
Or to have an MRI machine
break in
the middle of a procedure!

380
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,100
We're sorry about that.

381
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,380
It was the only way
to rule out a stroke
or brain hemorrhage.

382
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,580
And now that you have,
when can I go?

383
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,740
<i>(WOMAN CHATTERING

384
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,700
It's probably her mom.

385
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,140
I bet she's huge.
She's from the Midwest.

386
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,500

387
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,740
Since I was five.

388
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,940
And who are we talking about?
You know,
just in case you need me

389
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
to chime in and tell you
you're a lunatic
at some point?

390
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,500
Cameron. She's lying,
destroying hospital equipment,

391
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,820
telling Cuddy off.

392
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,140
I gotta find out
where she got
the Fat Scratch Fever.

393
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,460
Yeah, you definitely better
get to the bottom of that.

394
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,100
I heard Cuddy gave you
the name of a lawyer.

395
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,900
Or it could just be pity.
She feels guilty
about being born beautiful.

396
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,420
So she overcompensates
by being nice to ugly people.

397
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,340
Would explain why
she gets along
so well with you.

398
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,980
From what I hear,
the patient reminds her
of you, not me.

399
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,020
Call the lawyer.

400
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,220
Cameron sees a clump of dirt
and she thinks of me.

401
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,020
Or a lump of something else.
You're a lunatic.
Call the lawyer.

402
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,100
Very mature.
You started it.

403
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,060
Skin exam
and ACTH stimulation test
were both normal.

404
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,100
He has nystagmus
but it's congenital.

405
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,460
No way it's related
to the coma.

406
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,740
You say, "No way,"
I say... Yeah, no way.

407
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,940
Blood and urine were negative
for chlamydia,
herpes, and syphilis.

408
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,860
Looks like
we got ourselves a mystery.

409
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,180
Not for long.
He wants to be discharged.

Oh, sure.
Places to go, people to eat.

411

his chance of dying

412
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,980
from a hospital-acquired
infection

413
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,140
is greater than him dying
from whatever caused his coma.

414
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,100
Did you tell him
that statistics also say
that he's a big, fat idiot?

415
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,020
Yeah, I did.
He's not backing down.

416
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
He says
if we don't discharge him,
he'll leave AMA.

such a mystery after all.

Oh, and black people.

433
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,420
No one in their right mind
comes out of a coma

434
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,780
and immediately asks
to go home
with an unknown condition,

435
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,500
which means that either
you're not in your right mind

436
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,020
or it's not
an unknown condition.

437
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,140
So, what is it?
You tried to off yourself?

438
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,220
You figure I'm fat,
therefore I hate myself.

439
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,660
Yeah, that's a huge leap
of logic.

440
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,980
I don't wanna die.
I just don't wanna be here.

441
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,220
Then it's a condition
you've already had diagnosed,

442
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,860
or it's something
you know you've inherited.

443

which points toward
sexual abuse.

446
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,500

that points to a more
specific traumatic event.

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,900
We have no idea
what's wrong with the guy.

500
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,900
For all we know
he could be dead
in 12 hours.

501
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,940
He does not want our help.

502
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,060
Which means
he doesn't want your help.

503
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,940
He's obviously
just rationalizing.
And so are you!

504
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,380
You would never give up
this easy

505
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,700
if you weren't so busy
dealing with
your own personal problems.

506
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,140
Send him home.

507
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,060
What did you tell that cop?

508
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,100
Nothing.

509
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,340
Nothing as in nothing?

510
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,820
Or as in nothing
that could cause him to think

511
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,460
I have a stash
in my apartment?

512
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,420
He called to see
if I prescribed the pills,
I said yes. That's all.

513
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,420
Obviously not.
What happened?

514
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,460
He searched my house,
found a buttload of pills.

515
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,980
Guy's gotta be prepared
for a rainy day.

516
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,220
Last I checked
pharmacies were still open
when it rained.

517
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,700
And because I never know
when you're gonna be
in one of your moods

518
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,740
and cut me off.

519
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,940
Oh, it's my fault.

520
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,540
I'm not the one
who talked to the cop.

521
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,500
Well, I'm not the one
who put a thermometer
in his rectum.

522
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,860
So stop yelling at me
and start talking
to your lawyer.

523
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,060
Is there someone
who can check on you?

524
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,060
Oh, don't worry.

525
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,180
There's gonna be a whole crew
of carpenters in my bedroom

526
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,100
for the next week at least.

527
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,580
You know, there's an
Overeaters Anonymous meeting
here at the hospital.

528
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,820
If I wanted to
jump out of airplanes
or climb Mount Everest,

529
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,500
would you be telling me
to go to
Daredevils Anonymous?

530
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,620
I would be worried about you
just like I am now.

531
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,740
Don't be.

532
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,460
I enjoy food.

533
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,420
I like cooking it,
I like looking at it,
I like smelling it,

534
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,740
and I especially
like eating it.

535
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,100
Listen, whatever happens
is gonna happen.

536
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,300
Ultimately it's all
out of our control anyway.

537
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,620
Why doesn't
that philosophy apply

538
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,180
to medical mistakes
and hospital-acquired
infections as well?

539
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,500
I'm a complicated man,
Dr. Cameron.

540
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,380
But don't worry,
I plan on staying that way
for a long time.

541
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,140
Wait, wait, let us take you
all the way outside.

542
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,220
I'm fine.

543
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,620
It doesn't matter,
it's hospital rules.

544
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,740
Oh, screw the rules.
I've been on my back
for four days.

545
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,140
I need the exercise, right?

546
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,940
George, come on,
let us just take you
to the taxi.

547
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,100
Don't worry, I may not
be able to climb Everest,
but I can walk, okay?

548
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,540
George...
Now enough already.

549
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,340
George, are you all right?

550
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,100
George? You all right? George?

551
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,700
FOREMAN: Disorientation
and loss of balance

552
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,900
could mean
a neurofibromatosis.

553
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,340
Where's Chase?
Don't know.

554
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,940
Haven't seen him
since you told him
to sit on his ass yesterday.

555
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,340
Interesting.

556
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,860
NF2 is also inherited,
which means I was right.

557
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,980
You kept saying
it was pickwick's.

558
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,780
Between the first pickwick's
and the second pickwick's,
I said it was inherited.

559
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,740
Whatever.
NF2 doesn't explain fever.

560
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,540
I think we should focus
on the coma and the fever.

561
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,700
Why? The disorientation
and loss of balance
are more recent.

562
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,180
The coma was
the most severe symptom.

563
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,380
But he's not
in the coma anymore
and he is disoriented.

564
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,180
No, he's not.

565
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,500
We have a rather large piece
of tempered glass
that begs to differ.

566
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,140
I just mean
it's not connected.

567
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,540
You don't know that.

568
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,580
Yeah, I do.

569
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,900
How could
you possibly know...

570
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,500
Because I did it!

571
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,580
I didn't think
he should be discharged,

572
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,180
so I gave him
three grams of phenytoin.

573
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,140
I wasn't gonna just
let him leave.

574
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,740
But you were okay with him
crashing through a glass wall?

575
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,420
I tried to keep him
in the wheelchair,
but he's tough to stop.

576
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,380
Nice audible, Peyton.

577
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,180
So, what do we do now?

578
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,060
Discharge report says
he didn't eat his breakfast.

579
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,860
Humpty Dumpty
didn't get to be the size
of all the king's horses

580
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,700
by skipping
the most important meal
of the day.

581
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,460
What causes coma, fever,
and loss of appetite?

582
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,620
It can't be Chagas',
he's never been
outside the country.

583
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,740
But his stomach has.

584
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,220
The food we eat
no longer comes from
America's heartland.

585
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,660
It comes from South America's
deforested jungle land

586
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,380
where lettuce now grows
and lettuce pickers now poop.

587
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,660
Get a sample of his CSF

588
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,660
before the little bugs that
are now feasting on his brain
move on to dessert.

589
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,940
How are we gonna do that?
He's too big to do an LP.

590
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,820
So go straight to the source.

591
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,060
You wanna drill a hole
in my head?

592
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,260
It's the only way.

593
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,260
It's gotta be something
other than a parasite.

594
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,460
I buy my produce
at the best market in town
and I always wash it.

595
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,380
Leafy vegetables
can suck contaminated water

596
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,020
through their roots
right into the plant.

597
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,620
You could have
washed them in chlorine

598
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,500
and it still
wouldn't have mattered.

599
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,980
Then other people
would be sick as well.

600
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,540
The parasites could have been
on only a few items,

601
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,460
or maybe they just didn't eat
as much as you did.

602
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,260
It's always
about my weight, isn't it?

603
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,820
Why can't you people
come up with one theory...

604
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,180
This one fits, George.

605
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,300
It explains your coma,
your fever,
your loss of appetite...

606
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,100
And the disorientation?

607
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,220
It's all explained.

608
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,460
And if we don't treat it
while it's still
in the acute stage,

609
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,700
it'll be too late.

610
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,060
It could go on
to infect your heart,
intestines, esophagus...

611
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,220
This is what I get
for eating salad.

612
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
(DRILLING MACHINE WHIRRING)

613
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,140
FOREMAN: Suction.
NURSE: Suction.

614
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,740
Aspirator.

615
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,500
Your turn.

616
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,780
Irrigation.

617
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,980
Sponge.

618
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,300
What did you do?

619
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,500
Nothing. Why, what's wrong?

620
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,500
(STUTTERING) I can't see.

621
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,220
Vision's blurry
or you've lost...

622
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,700
I didn't lose it,
you took it from me!

623
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,460
George, calm down.
I can't see!

624
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,660
Give me some lorazepam!

625
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,540
What did you do to me?
Hold still!

626
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,980
George! George!
What's going on?

627
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,060
No. No. Calm down!
What did you do to me?

628
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,660
There's no inflammation
in the optic nerve
and his retina's intact.

629
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,060
The blindness
has to have been caused
by something in his brain.

630
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,060
And not surprisingly
there was no sign of Chagas'

631
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,020
or any other
parasites in his CSF.

632
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,140
So we've ruled out
his parents,

633
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,540
prostitutes, the arugula.
Means either...

634
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,900
I took the sample
from the prefrontal.

635
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,740
I was never anywhere
near his visual cortex.

636
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,460
Or you missed a tumor
on the MRI.

637
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,220
Not a chance,
the MRI was clean.

638
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,020
You mind?
Where are you going?

639
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,700
To get a $400 butt plug.

640
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,820
What about George?

641
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,100
He's gonna have to
get his own. Come on.

642
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,660
Let's see if we can
get this thing figured out

643
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,220
by the time
we get to the elevator.

644
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,740
It could be MS.

645
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,340
Would explain the coma,
the blindness,

646
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,740
loss of balance,
and the fever.

647
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,580
Could also explain
his lack of concern
for his health.

648
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,180
MS can cause
excessive cheerfulness.

649
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,500
Yeah, he's a delight.

650
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,820
You don't get to MS
with coma
as the first symptom.

651
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,180
Blindness plus coma
says diabetes. Just in time.

652
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,180
No. Blood sugar,
urine dip stick and
hemoglobin A1c are normal.

653
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,780
Were normal when you tested.

654
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,940
He's been
in and out of a coma,

655
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,500
whatever's going on
is waxing and waning,

656
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,460
unlike his pants size,
which only waxes.

657
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,100
Which also points to diabetes.
Test him again.

658
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,420
And this time add
a glucose tolerance test
and an HEC.

659
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,100
We already have
a CSF sample,

660
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,740
we might as well
check it for proteins
to rule out MS first.

661
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,180
Agreed. Except for the part
about doing it first.

662
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,220
Where are you going?

663
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,660
The butt plug
was my way of saying,
"Mind your own business."

664
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,340
Apparently too subtle.

665
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,460
George, all it is
is sugar water, I promise.

666
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,060
Just because I'm overweight
doesn't make me diabetic!

667
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,140
You tested me,
everybody's tested me.

668
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,860
Sometimes
the blood sugar levels
can fluctuate,

669
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,140
make it difficult
to diagnose.

670
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,420
You stuck a needle in my brain
and 10 seconds later
I was blind!

671
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,260
How is that difficult
to diagnose?

672
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,660
Who the hell knows
what else you guys
done to me?

673
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,420
I should have
never come here!
You didn't come here,

674
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,300
you were brought here
because you were in a coma
and barely alive.

675
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,900
We didn't do that to you,
you need to let us figure out
what did.

676
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,660
For someone who insists
he enjoys life
as much as you do,

677
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,620
you certainly
don't seem willing
to do much to prolong it.

678
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,100
Yeah,

679
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,660
because I don't agree
with the brilliant doctors,
suddenly I'm suicidal!

680
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,100
Refusing to cooperate with us
does not make you suicidal,
it makes you an idiot.

681
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,820
You think
we want to see you blind
or in a coma?

682
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,900
I've been fat all my life.

683
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,340
I've only been sick
for the past few days.

684
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,020
You look for a disease
that has nothing to do
with my size,

685
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,620
and I will help you.

686
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,260
Otherwise, leave me alone.

687
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,460
Speeding, DUI,
reckless driving,

688
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,300
resisting arrest,
possession of
a class three narcotic.

689
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,500
And now it looks like
they've added

690
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,900
another possession
with intent
to traffic charge as well.

691
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,060
They found some pills
at your house.

692
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,220
All of which
I had a prescription for.

693
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
That's a lot of pills.

694
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,100
I'm in a lot of pain.

695
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,540
This is all because some cop
came into the clinic,

696
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,180
I was rude to him,
this is his way
of getting back at me.

697
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,420
You've made it pretty easy.

698
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,900
His insane reaction
to a simple
rectal thermometer reading

699
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,460
probably says
a lot more about his mother
than it says about me.

700
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,140
I'm inclined to think
your particular charm

701
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,420
may not be immediately
appreciated by a jury.

702
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,220
I'm not interested
in a plea bargain.

703
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,540
It's your best bet
to make this go away.

704
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,420
There is no this.
There's a him.

705
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,260
The only thing I'm guilty of
is humiliating a bully.

706
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,740
I wasn't speeding,
I wasn't impaired,
I didn't resist,

707
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,540
and I certainly was not
distributing narcotics

708
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,740
to anyone but myself,

709
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,740
because I need
those narcotics.

710
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,980
Five grand retainer.

711
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,220
If we end up going to trial,
there'll be another 30 due
before the first day.

712
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,180
My hourly is 450.
That work for you?

713
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,660
What'd your lawyer say?

714
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,940
I looked up butt plug
in a legal dictionary.
What'd he say?

715
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,340
That a smile like mine
can't lose.

716
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,100
What did the tests say?

717
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,020
You were right about MS.
No myelin basic proteins
in his CSF.

718
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,380
What about diabetes?
Don't know.

719
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,620
He says
we only think it's diabetes

720
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,260
because of his weight,
won't let us test him.

721
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,900
So, you would rather
be a blind invalid
than admit the fact

722
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,660
that maybe you might have
a little problem
with overeating.

723
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,740
By a little problem,
of course,

724
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,580
I mean you've eaten yourself
half to death.

725
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,820
And you would rather
let me die
than consider the fact

726
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,980
that whatever is wrong with me
has nothing to do
with my weight.

727
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,340
I go where the symptoms
tell me to go.

728
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,220
And right now
they're asking why this stuff

729
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,340
is the first thing
you've ever refused
to swallow.

730
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,540
I am not diabetic.

731
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,980
Grocery stores
giving away medical degrees
with the free turkeys now?

732
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,020
The sooner you drink this,

733
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,980
the sooner I get to go
waste my time
with something else.

734
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,580
Get the hell off of me!

735
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,420
No dessert
till you've finished
your dinner!

736
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,220
George, just drink it!

737
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,420
Nurse!

738
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,060
Get this jackass off of me!

739
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,580
What the hell is going on?

742
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,500
Let go!

743
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,540
What's going on?

744
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,380
Get X-rays of his hands.
Then bronc him,
do a sputum cytology

745
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,660
and check his CSF
for anti-hu antibodies.

746
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,820
How are we gonna get him
to do all that,

747
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,460
we can't even
get him to drink a bottle
of sugar water?

748
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,900
Tell him that lung cancer
is in no way
connected to obesity.

749
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,140
You don't think
he'll realize we're lying?

750
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,580
You're not.
Lung cancer's got nothing
to do with obesity.

751
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,220
I meant about him
having lung cancer.

752
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,420
You didn't notice
his fingers?

753
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,700
I noticed they were fat.

754
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,020
You should have
pissed him off,

755
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
he would have grabbed you.

756
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,300
Then you would have
felt the bones,

757
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,860
they're not just fat,
they're clubbed.

758
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,540
George,

759
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,020
it's me.

760
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,900
Your tests were positive.

761
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,860
You have a small cell
lung carcinoma.

762
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,220
It caused a paraneoplastic
neurologic syndrome,

763
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,060
which in turn
caused your blindness
and coma.

764
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,180
The cancer's metastasized
to your lymph nodes.

765
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,460
It's inoperable,

766
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,300
but there are
radiation treatments
available.

767
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,340
They might give you
a few more months.

768
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,740

<i>He said, "C'est la vie."</i>

774
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,860
He's a complicated man.

775
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,460
What about you?

776
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,660
What are you gonna do
about your problem?

777
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,620
Nothing. Just got a call
from my lawyer.

778
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,780
He gave the DA copies
of my prescriptions.

779
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,460
Soon as they confirm
they're bona fides,

780
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,300
they're gonna drop
the possession,
DUI and resisting arrest.

781
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,420
Soon as I pay
my $85 speeding ticket

782
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,140
and the impound fine,
I get my bike back.

783
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,340
I guess that's good.

784
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,260
You guess?
No, it's good.

785
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,940
You get to keep going
like you always have.

786
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,380
All right, I give up.
Who was it?

787
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,300
Who in your family
had the weight problem?

788
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,700
You think I can only care
about a patient

789
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,700
if I know someone else
who's been through
the same thing?

790
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,060
You care for everybody.

791
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,300
You only lie
and stand up to Cuddy
for a few.

792
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,500
You lie for everybody
and only care about a few.

793
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,140
You're avoiding the question.

794
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,420
I like damaged people,
remember?

795
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,620
It explains everything I do.

796
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,940
Almost everything.

797
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,100
It wasn't you, was it?

798
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
Does it matter?

799
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,180
Nope, but it'd be interesting.

800
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,380
Sorry to disappoint you,

801
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,500
but sometimes the answers
just aren't that simple.

802
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,220
I know he can be a real ass,

803
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,500
and he has no problem lying
when it serves him,

804
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,100
but he's not lying
about the pain.

805
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,260
He needs the medication,
which is why
I prescribed it.

806
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,300
All of it.

807
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,500
Well, I see a lot of cases

808
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,500
where people who have
real injuries
end up getting addicted.

809
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,660
And then, well, things kind of
spiral out of control.

810
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,820
And lives get ruined,
and not just their own.

811
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,540
I don't know what else
to tell you.

812
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,260
What about these?

813
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,940
This is getting...

814
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,300
If it's got my name on it,
it's a legit scrip.

815
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,820
You sure?
Yeah.

816
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,580
Because the signatures
on these

817
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,860
look a little different
than the signatures on those.

818
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,140
You look surprised.

819
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,700
No, I'm just...

820
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,740
I hadn't thought about it.
I do sign my name
differently sometimes.

821
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,620
Are you sure?
Yeah.

822
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,860
I just, I guess get bored
signing it the same way.

823
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,740
You know what they say
about doctors' handwriting.

824
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,380
I'm gonna give you a moment

825
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,460
to reconsider that answer.

826
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,980
Because if you are,
for some reason, mistaken,

827
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,020
we will find out,
and that will not be good
for you.

829
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,700
I am sure. Absolutely.

830
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,460
All right.

831
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,900
I guess that's it, then.

832
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,020
