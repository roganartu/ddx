00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:38,060
And I said force diuresis
and try dialysis.

177
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:39,294
You need a transcript?

178
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:40,762
You want to put him
on dialysis,

179
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,864
risk infection
and hemodynamic swings

180
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:43,998
when we can just chelate?

181
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:47,467
Whoa, whoa.
Settle down.

182
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:48,802
If we chelate,

183
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,503
we're not gonna know
what disease he had,

184
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,338
<i>which means we're not</i>
<i>gonna know if the problem</i>

185
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,609
was in his lousy old job
or his still-lousy new life.

186
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,578
Which for the purposes
of a metaphorical argument

187
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:01,382
is very important.

188
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,884
Pointless to argue.

189
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:04,652
<i>He's the boss.</i>
<i>He needs his puzzle solved.</i>

190
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,487
Why bang our heads
against the wall?

191
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,857
When you're done
with the patient,

192
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:13,194
treat Foreman by banging
his head against the wall.

193
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:14,562
Where's the dialysis machine?

194
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,866
Who cares?
Since I ordered chelation.

195
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:20,269
We'll flip a coin, tell House
it was one disease or the other.

196
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:22,404
Worst case, he finds out and
he's impressed we defied him.

197
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:25,074
I'm sorry. I asked you to remove
the dialysis equipment,

198
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:27,377
not the chelation equipment.

199
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,479
And Dr. Cuddy asked me
to remove all equipment.

200
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,782
She de-authorized
all treatment.

201
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:36,821
<i>She won't let us make a move</i>

202
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,055
<i>until you agree</i>
<i>to a sit-down</i>

203
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:39,556
<i>with the godmother</i>
<i>and her consigliere.</i>

204
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:41,825
Bitch to king four.

205
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:42,825
Checkmate.

206
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:44,860
Patient can't use his leg.

207
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:48,996
You have to concede.

208
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:50,965
Or I could just knock
all the pieces

209
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,434
onto the floor.

210
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:55,202
You're discharging me?

211
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,771
<i>We really...</i>

212
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:59,573
Don't have
a good lie here, so...

213
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:01,208
You got caught
in some politics

214
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:02,509
between our boss
and his boss,

215
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:04,044
but you'll be out of here
20 minutes tops.

216
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:05,679
I'm not better,
but you're kicking me out?

217
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,081
Which is why
it'll only be 20 minutes.

218
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,416
See, the Dean of Medicine
acts tough,

219
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:09,451
but she's not really.

220
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,053
She'll step in,
readmit you.

221
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:12,988
So you're saying that she cares
more about his treatment

222
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:14,656
than the doctor who's
actually treating him.

223
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:18,627
Phil, shut up.

224
00:09:18,694 --> 00:09:22,430
Cyrus.

225
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,065
Jennifer.

226
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,634
It's good to see you.

227
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,736
<i>I read about you</i>
<i>in the paper,</i>

228
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:31,673
<i>so I hopped the first</i>
<i>train from Virginia.</i>

229
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,209
So you read that
he struck it rich?

230
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:37,378
He's right.

231
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,414
It--it must look weird.

232
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:42,250
It kind of is weird.

233
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:45,186
Well, we're a long way
from the third street jetty.

234
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:47,488
<i>I just wanted to see</i>
<i>you again and say hi,</i>

235
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:51,024
<i>so...Hi.</i>

236
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:56,228
Hi.

237
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,364
I was starting to think
I'd never find my...

238
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,666
<i>Baby bear.</i>

239
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:14,351
Oh, my God.
I'm--I'm so sorry.

240
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,486
I'm so sorry.

241
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:17,454
I--I don't even
feel nauseous.

242
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:18,489
I don't know why--

243
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:20,458
your hand is shaking.
Okay.

244
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:21,759
You're having
a focal seizure.

245
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,227
What does that mean?

246
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,263
It means you're not
getting discharged.

247
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,584
We were right
that it's a brain issue,

248
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:30,520
but wrong about toxic inhalation
and metal poisoning.

249
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,564
Everyone else is waiting--

250
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,165
That was totally
courageous of Khloe

251
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,800
to Tweet about
her weight gain.

252
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,468
House, I've got a patient
with a seizure disorder

253
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:38,936
who can't walk.

254
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:40,003
<i>Another one?</i>

255
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:41,338
Thought we kicked out
the last one.

256
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:45,107
Obviously I'll let you
treat your patient.

257
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:46,642
What are you doing?

258
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,847
We got a patient with a walking
disorder who can't seize.

259
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,882
No, wait.
I'm close, though, right?

260
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:55,183
<i>I wasn't finished.</i>

261
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,751
Of course I'll let you
treat your patient

262
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:58,852
if you meet me halfway.

263
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,988
Well, I guess
I'm not finished either.

264
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:03,190
No clinic hours
for the next quarter.

265
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:04,724
Yeah,
three parking spots,

266
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,725
next to each other,
so I can park diagonally,

267
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:09,761
and three pairs
of your underwear.

268
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:14,432
I'm thinking of
taking up sailing.

269
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,933
Forget it.

270
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:18,235
Treat your patient,
don't treat your patient.

271
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,937
Come to the meeting,
don't come to the meeting.

272
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:21,304
I'm done playing your game.

273
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:22,738
You realize the game
is automatically over

274
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:27,342
when the loser loses, right?

275
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,178
Neurological lyme disease

276
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,781
explains the seizures
and the paralysis.

277
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:34,249
But not the fact that Chase
seems to be treating you.

278
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,985
He claims he can swear off
sex indefinitely.

279
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:41,622
<i>Also claims that I am a boiling</i>
<i>cauldron of repressed rage.</i>

280
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,961
Your theory is idiotic.

281
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:53,565
<i>The patient's antibody titers</i>
<i>were negative for lyme disease.</i>

282
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:57,067
And I shared a motel room
with your ex-girlfriend.

283
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:02,972
You make a good point
about the antibody titers.

284
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,240
He's a rock.

285
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,475
How's your brother--
homeless guy?

286
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,076
Haven't heard from him
in months!

287
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,911
I don't know.
Wish I did.

288
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,412
<i>Postural hypotension,</i>

289
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,847
which could have reduced
the blood supply to his brain.

290
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:16,615
He'd be a miserable wretch.

291
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:18,049
Actually,
the prognosis is--

292
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:19,383
Oh, I'm sorry.

293
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,952
No, I just meant his life
is gonna unravel.

294
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,055
In fairness,
that applies to any diagnosis.

295
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,393
Why do we do this?

296
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:29,164
It's not postural hypotension.
He's not orthostatic.

297
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:30,733
<i>His life may unravel,</i>
<i>it may not.</i>

298
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,868
He's not chasing after
material things.

299
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:34,370
<i>Too bad.</i>
<i>He might actually get those.</i>

300
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:35,638
<i>He's looking for love.</i>

301
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:37,106
Just tracked down
an old girlfriend.

302
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,008
<i>And she'll never live up</i>
<i>to the memory,</i>

303
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:41,176
<i>and the thrill of finding</i>
<i>her will wear off,</i>

304
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:44,912
and he won't even be able
to dream about being happy.

305
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,714
Interesting.

306
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,650
The patient may have found
some long-ago nookie,

307
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:50,719
but it doesn't mean he hasn't
had some in the meantime.

308
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,120
Herpes encephalitis.

309
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,356
Explains
the neurological symptoms.

310
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:56,224
EEG to confirm,

311
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:58,293
I.V. acyclovir to treat.

312
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,595
How's Foreman's
BP holding?

313
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:01,563
Same.

314
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:02,798
<i>That's strange,</i>

315
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,166
since I unplugged the lead
30 seconds ago.

316
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,241
<i>Admirable effort.</i>

317
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,509
And I'm not just saying that

318
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:16,010
'cause I'm scared
you might turn green

319
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,045
and rip through
your own clothes.

320
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:23,950
Down on the patient's romance

321
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:28,020
because your own lifespan is
shorter than dinner and a movie?

322
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:31,556
You're the one who said
miserable stays miserable.

323
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,992
You keep saying it.
Several times a day.

324
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:35,593
I love being back,

325
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,528
having every theory
you and I share

326
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:40,229
used as proof of my own
personal damage.

327
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:49,438
I'm afraid we'll
need you to step out

328
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:50,740
when the EEG begins.

329
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,341
The waiting area's
just down the hall.

330
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,076
I got to catch an early train
in the morning anyway.

331
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:55,644
No, don't.

332
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:59,181
I'll put you up in a nice hotel,
or rent you a furnished place.

333
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:02,685
I came for the night 'cause
I wanted to see how you were.

334
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:04,921
Maybe get back
in your life a bit,

335
00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:06,222
but if I take your money...

336
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,226
What's wrong with
a nice place to stay?

337
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:12,262
Unless of course...

338
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,130
You don't want to stay.

339
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,465
I guess I could keep
my motel room

340
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,601
another night or two.

341
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:30,145
Need a consult.

342
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:32,113
Did an EEG on my patient.

343
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:34,081
Turns out the reason
that prior doctors

344
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,416
thought it wasn't
a neuro problem

345
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:37,886
is because it's
not a neuro problem.

346
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:41,122
<i>The EEG did show signs</i>
<i>of metabolic distress.</i>

347
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,056
Well, scan his abdomen.

348
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:45,290
Yeah, let's assume we'd already
figured that out on our own,

349
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:47,391
<i>and found a mass</i>
<i>on the pancreas.</i>

350
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:54,432
Mass looks solid.
I'd say it's cancer.

351
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,766
Paraneoplastic syndrome

352
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,402
would explain
the neurological symptoms.

353
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:58,303
You need to get
a piece of it.

354
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,804
Schedule a CT-guided biopsy.

355
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:04,576
Yeah, let's assume we'd already
figured that out on our own.

356
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:08,547
Then what's this consult?

357
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:10,248
Why haven't you
been yelling at me

358
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:13,685
about the Cuddy twins?

359
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:15,253
Because you're doing
the right thing.

360
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:17,789
Are we talking about
the same issue?

361
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:19,924
Is there something
I don't know about

362
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:21,893
that I'm responding
to appropriately?

363
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:23,929
Cuddy wants you
in the middle of this.

364
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:25,497
So does Arlene.

365
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,498
Because they don't want
to face their own problem.

366
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:30,535
Somehow, in your knee-jerk,
juvenile way,

367
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:35,872
you tripped and fell into an
actual adult response to this.

368
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,907
You're right.

369
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:45,715
That was Cuddy's
strategy all along.

370
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:47,183
She wanted me to think

371
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:50,053
that she desperately
needed me to be there

372
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,288
so that I wouldn't be there.

373
00:15:59,163 --> 00:16:01,097
Where is Dr. House?

374
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,966
I didn't want him here.

375
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:05,569
This isn't about her treatment
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

376
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:09,038
It's about the fight
we had last week.

377
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:10,773
<i>I'd like a moment</i>
<i>with my mother</i>

378
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,243
to try and work this out
on our own.

379
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,278
I'm afraid my client
doesn't want to--

380
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:16,846
It's mother's day Sunday.

381
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:19,681
We can't have five minutes
alone to fix this?

382
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,182
Relax.
You can still bill me

383
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,418
for the time
standing in the hallway.

384
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,523
I know you're mad at me,

385
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,659
but you can barely make it
up those stairs.

386
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:33,861
<i>How many nights have you</i>
<i>spent on your couch?</i>

387
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,897
This has nothing to do
with our fight.

388
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:38,467
We're talking about my home,
not a prison camp.

389
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:39,901
<i>What did I just say?</i>

390
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:42,171
I think it was something
about this not being personal.

391
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,306
You can spend time
with Rachel.

392
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:44,707
I can watch over you.

393
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:45,708
Win, win.

394
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:47,043
Maybe I've got
a medical thing.

395
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:48,645
Maybe I just think
I'm talking,

396
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:50,146
but no one can hear me,

397
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:53,250
not just
my uncaring daughter.

398
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:54,184
What do you want?

399
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:55,685
20 grand.

400
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:58,421
I'll hire help and forget
this nightmare you put me thr--

401
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:01,358
make it 30.
I'll put in a stair lift.

402
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:05,028
If my board even hears
about these threats,

403
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:06,896
let alone a settlement,

404
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:08,197
<i>they'll investigate</i>
<i>what happened</i>

405
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:09,465
<i>while you were here</i>
<i>as a patient.</i>

406
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:13,368
House and I could both
lose our licenses.

407
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:16,105
I've been assuming
this is personal

408
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:17,707
because I don't want to assume

409
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,942
that was what
my mother wants.

410
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,650
House.

411
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:28,851
Ex-not-mom-in-law.

412
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,219
You said
you weren't coming.

413
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:33,723
After you said pretty please
with sugar on top?

414
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,324
Problem is we only
give store credit,

415
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:39,095
<i>so I say we put your old,</i>
<i>cracked poisonous hip back in.</i>

416
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:40,330
Here and now.

417
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:41,297
I saved your life.

418
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:42,298
Happy to un-save it.

419
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:43,833
He is being an ass.

420
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,634
If I could join you
in suing him--

421
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:47,336
She's like this
in bed too.

422
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,504
Always scheming to get
the lawyers out of the room.

423
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:55,309
<i>If House isn't going</i>
<i>to take this seriously,</i>

424
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,011
I know a few judges
who will.

425
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,750
Was I supposed to be
the good cop?

426
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,955
I had to rig the monitor.

427
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,558
I had a lot of salt
with breakfast.

428
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,796
You think I'm repressed too?

429
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,832
I think you're in danger
of being dissolved

430
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,867
by your own stomach acids.

431
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:21,335
Well, what about Chase?

432
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:23,637
Believe all that nonsense
about him being celibate?

433
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,539
Don't know,
but I'm rooting for him.

434
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,073
Read the studies.

435
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,808
The fewer partners you have,

436
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,744
the happier you are
with your ultimate partner.

437
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,981
Hmm. Then you're
gonna be miserable.

438
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,482
The studies,

439
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,719
it's important that they
have a control group.

440
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,524
There's the tumor
on his pancreas.

441
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:48,964
There's one on his kidney
and one in his colon.

442
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:52,800
One looks ascular,
one looks vascular.

443
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:54,869
The third looks calcifie

444
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:57,705
he has three completely
different cancers at once.

445
00:18:57,773 --> 00:19:00,441
<i>On average,</i>
<i>not so lucky after all.</i>

446
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,942
You had to go all
Wile E. Coyote on me.

447
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:08,302
You told me that Arlene
wanted me in the middle of it.

448
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,167
I had to show her that
no good would come of that.

449
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:13,704
Seriously?
That's your rationalization?

450
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:17,341
How about you didn't like
that Cuddy tricked you?

451
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,109
Even though you wanted
the same thing as her.

452
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:21,945
You didn't like that she got
the best of you.

453
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:23,913
You've got more anger
toward her than you realize.

454
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:27,985
I'm happier without her.

455
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:31,923
I'm not stupidly expecting her
to make me happy.

456
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,759
I'm happier
with my unhappiness.

457
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:36,860
Do you listen
to what you're saying?

458
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:38,161
Because I have to.

459
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,663
I'm holding a summit meeting
to force you and Cuddy

460
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:43,199
onto the same page
before a lawsuit gets filed.

461
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:52,211
<i>Three completely</i>
<i>unrelated cancers at once.</i>

462
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,080
<i>Multi-cancer syndrome--</i>
<i>Von Hippel Lindau?</i>

463
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:57,015
Wouldn't have
touched his colon.

464
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:00,952
I hereby certify
that Dr. Foreman

465
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,688
has not tampered with this
blood pressure mechanism

466
00:20:03,756 --> 00:20:04,956
<i>in any way.</i>

467
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:07,158
And after I prove
I'm 100% stress free,

468
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:09,427
do I get to strap you
into a chastity belt?

469
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:11,028
<i>What if the patient's missing</i>

470
00:20:11,096 --> 00:20:13,397
<i>a tumor-suppressor gene?</i>

471
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:15,633
How would we even find it?

472
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,934
<i>We need to blast him</i>
<i>with chemo now.</i>

473
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:18,535
We can't give the patient chemo.

474
00:20:18,603 --> 00:20:20,137
His platelet count's
through the floor.

475
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,139
Even worse,
it'd contain his cancers.

476
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:23,640
<i>If we want to know</i>
<i>what they have in common,</i>

477
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:25,275
we got to see
where they spread next.

478
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:27,010
<i>You want to wait six months</i>
<i>while the cancer spreads</i>

479
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:28,612
and his seizures and
paralysis get worse?

480
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,213
Well, now,
that's crazy talk.

481
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:31,881
But if we pump the patient

482
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:35,918
full of vascular endothelial
growth factor...

483
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:39,956
Foreman doesn't
like that idea.

484
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:48,298
You want to grow more
and bigger cancers?

485
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:50,734
We can't figure out what
three small ones have in common,

486
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:53,703
maybe can figure out what
eight big ones have in common?

487
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:58,041
Is this idea real,

488
00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:00,009
or are you just threatening
to kill the patient

489
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:01,978
to screw with me?

490
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:09,019
This whole thing
is idiotic.

491
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,287
What does it matter
what's inside of me

492
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:11,288
if I know
how to control it?

493
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:12,790
<i>Makes no difference to us,</i>

494
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:15,626
but you may want
to make out a will.

495
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,961
Go get lotto boy's consent,

496
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:20,096
and turn his cancers
up to 11.

497
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,706
You, what,
found my old yearbook,

498
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:33,008
and got a picture of
my high school boyfriend?

499
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:35,076
Actually, that would
have been a lot simpler.

500
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:37,479
No, I took this
ten minutes ago.

501
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:43,219
Your high school boyfriend
who dumped you,

502
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:44,954
leaving you unable to believe

503
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,921
that anyone can rekindle
an old flame.

504
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:50,157
He dumped me after
I hooked up with his sister.

505
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:58,632
Would you mind
letting him down gently?

506
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:01,534
I might have made promises
you can't keep.

507
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,608
We're giving you more cancer.

508
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:11,077
<i>The risks of that</i>
<i>are kind of obvious.</i>

509
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:13,212
We'll scan you, run your blood
at frequent intervals.

510
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,747
<i>We believe</i>
<i>this is our best chance</i>

511
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:17,483
<i>at finding the underlying</i>
<i>genetic flaw.</i>

512
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,996
Will you marry me?

513
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,835
Don't be stupid.

514
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,603
If this cancer
overwhelms me,

515
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:39,305
<i>at least I'll die happy</i>
<i>here and now,</i>

516
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:40,841
instead of hoping
for a future

517
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:43,543
I may never have.

518
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:46,213
I love you.

519
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,880
No, you don't.

520
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:50,517
You don't know.
You can't know.

521
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:57,456
We both need more time.

522
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:59,458
And I believe
we're gonna have it.

523
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,034
Do you notice she's wearing
different clothes every day?

524
00:23:09,102 --> 00:23:11,836
As opposed to the same,
starfleet-issued tunic?

525
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:13,004
She said she came
for one night.

526
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:14,372
Why'd she pack for more?

527
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,940
So she stuffed an extra
sweatshirt in her bag,

528
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:17,208
or she bought something.

529
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:19,477
Used? She's here because
an old beau struck gold.

530
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,079
She turned down
a proposal.

531
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:22,614
How long a game
you think she's playing?

532
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:23,982
I think if she said yes
after 14 hours,

533
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,350
even he'd be suspicious.

534
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,485
You're lucky you're hot
and smart, because--

535
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:31,322
well, you're just lucky
you're hot and smart.

536
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:50,340
I need a hooker.

537
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:53,810
Not if you can make that work.

538
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:56,580
How is that
supposed to relax you?

539
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:58,715
It's not for me.
It's for Chase.

540
00:23:58,783 --> 00:24:00,384
I'm saving myself too.

541
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:01,551
Maybe you should
get a couple.

542
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,386
You're riding me.
Why not ride him?

543
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:05,421
Because I can get a rise
out of your BP.

544
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:07,457
His pp on the other hand...

545
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:09,793
<i>Forget yoga.</i>
<i>Embrace Zen.</i>

546
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:11,028
You're a repressed idiot.

547
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:12,495
He's a horny idiot.

548
00:24:12,563 --> 00:24:14,731
Neither one of you
can do anything about it.

549
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,101
Pretty sure that's Zen.

550
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:40,124
Thought we were meeting
in Cuddy's office.

551
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,726
And I put one of
the radio frequency

552
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,294
tagged sponges
from the O.R.

553
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:44,962
In your
portable television.

554
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,364
However much it hurt,

555
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:47,866
I did have a right
to break up with you.

556
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:49,835
You just want everything to have
a hidden personal agenda.

557
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:51,169
You need to get over it

558
00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:52,938
instead of torpedoing
our jobs out of spite.

559
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,907
Couldn't just be that
you're a pain professionally.

560
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:56,642
<i>Stop!</i>

561
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,210
You're both at fault here.

562
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:00,046
You for trying
to manipulate House

563
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:01,247
when you used to know better,

564
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:04,216
and you for...
Being you,

565
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:06,284
which an especially bad idea
under the circumstances.

566
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:07,851
I had good reasons.

567
00:25:07,952 --> 00:25:10,120
You had lame
rationalizations.

568
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:11,821
If I hadn't played him,

569
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:14,123
he'd have found out about the
meeting and crashed it anyway.

570
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:15,424
Would have been
a lot more efficient.

571
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:17,026
Enough! Okay,
here's what's gonna happen.

572
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:19,363
Tomorrow I drive
both of you to Arlene's.

573
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:21,631
You're gonna write her
a personal check for $30,000,

574
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:22,966
<i>and tell her she can stay</i>
<i>in her own home</i>

575
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:23,967
<i>with your blessing.</i>

576
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:25,202
<i>You're gonna do this</i>

577
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:27,037
because you actually
give a crap about your job

578
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:28,939
and this hospital
and your mother,

579
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:31,441
and possibly even House.

580
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:33,110
<i>And you're gonna say,</i>
<i>"I'm sorry,"</i>

581
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:35,212
and not utter
one syllable more.

582
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,746
Because I'm an idiot?

583
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:38,748
No, because if you don't,
I'm gonna tell the pharmacy

584
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,549
to stop issuing Vicodin
prescriptions in <i>my name.</i>

585
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:53,013
Anything look different?

586
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:54,515
Not yet.

587
00:25:54,582 --> 00:25:55,816
Where's Jennifer?

588
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:59,152
She's embezzling money
from my Swiss bank account.

589
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,486
That's what you think,
isn't it?

590
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:03,856
I'm being taken for a ride?

591
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:06,257
I think
she wouldn't be here

592
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:09,527
if you were still
fixing refrigerators.

593
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:10,962
One random set of numbers

594
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,963
doesn't change human nature.

595
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:16,066
Those sets of numbers
are what kept me going.

596
00:26:16,134 --> 00:26:17,767
Clutching those tickets,

597
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:20,335
thinking about the life
I could have,

598
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:21,937
finding Jennifer again.

599
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:24,339
So you figure if one
long-shot dream came true

600
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:26,608
the other one will as well?

601
00:26:26,676 --> 00:26:29,877
You think
you're protecting me.

602
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:32,046
I think you're sad.

603
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:35,348
Can't stand to see
somebody happy.

604
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:45,824
Mom, here's a check.

605
00:26:45,892 --> 00:26:48,293
It's a settlement
for all you've been through.

606
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,694
Of course you can
stay in your home.

607
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:51,295
It was wrong of me
to suggest otherwise.

608
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:57,234
I'm sorry.

609
00:26:57,335 --> 00:26:59,302
That we saved your life.

610
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:04,773
In the way that we did.

611
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:06,708
B-plus.

612
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,843
I hope this
resolves everything.

613
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:11,512
I can tell you that both
your daughter and Dr. House--

614
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,714
this is 30 grand.

615
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:15,116
Which is what
you asked for.

616
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:16,817
This covers
pain and suffering.

617
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,687
What about
the probate lawyer?

618
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:20,754
Do you two...

619
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:22,890
<i>I have to change my will,</i>

620
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,158
leave everything to Julia

621
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,427
so this one doesn't try
more funny business

622
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:27,795
<i>to get control of my home.</i>

623
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:30,230
I'm sure we can toss in
another 2,500.

624
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,532
Well, I guess I'll have
to kill you tonight then.

625
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,567
Mom,
I'm not interested in--

626
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:36,268
You already think
you own my body.

627
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:38,237
Why not my home too?

628
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:39,638
Everybody stay calm, and--

629
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:42,009
You have to lash out at
everyone who tries to help you?

630
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:44,278
Live in your own kitchen sink
for all I care.

631
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:45,680
<i>Harsh.</i>

632
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,182
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>you had a case before,</i>

633
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,451
but that is no way
to talk to a patient.

634
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:52,086
You are right.

635
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,867
Chase has had his eyes
on this one for months.

636
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,270
<i>Meaning he has eyes?</i>

637
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:11,072
<i>I paid her 100 bucks.</i>

638
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:12,306
When he hits on her--

639
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:13,908
might be tonight,
might be next week--

640
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:16,077
she's gonna slap him
and storm off.

641
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:19,114
So your plan is to prove
you're both full of crap

642
00:28:19,182 --> 00:28:20,716
all in one move?

643
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,218
<i>First he'll</i>
<i>compliment her hair.</i>

644
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:23,786
<i>That's how he breaks the ice.</i>

645
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:28,356
<i>Next comes some kind of</i>
<i>joke or story.</i>

646
00:28:28,424 --> 00:28:29,857
<i>He's sharpening his harpoon.</i>

647
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:32,859
Are my moves
this predictable?

648
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,528
<i>She's grabbing his arm.</i>

649
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:37,129
He's going in
for the kill.

650
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,791
Don't let it
get to you.

651
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:14,498
<i>Poured a lot of gas</i>
<i>on the fire.</i>

652
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:16,566
Ultrasound will give us
a good look at the damage.

653
00:29:16,634 --> 00:29:17,967
Little more gel.

654
00:29:18,035 --> 00:29:19,402
I never made a will.

655
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:21,171
I want to provide for you,
if I don't--

656
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,706
Stop it, will you?

657
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,975
<i>Like you to hold</i>
<i>your breath for a sec.</i>

658
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:28,278
Your money,
there's charities, causes.

659
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:29,913
Your family.

660
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:33,282
You got to ask yourself
what's mattered to you most

661
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,483
year in and year out.

662
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:40,089
That can't be right.

663
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:42,257
Is it bad news?

664
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:43,893
No.

665
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:47,264
We've been pumping you
with growth factor,

666
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:50,300
but you don't have
any new cancers.

667
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:54,371
The tumors you had
all shrank.

668
00:29:56,677 --> 00:29:59,311
Three tumors disappearing
means we were probably wrong

669
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,473
about him missing
a tumor-suppressor gene.

670
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,007
How many mulligans
are you gonna ask for?

671
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:05,708
This test is what raised
my blood pressure.

672
00:30:05,776 --> 00:30:08,311
I'm used to it now.

673
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:10,545
Go.

674
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:12,547
If it's autoimmune

675
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,181
and he created antibodies

676
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:15,882
that ended up
fighting his own tumors...

677
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,084
Growth factor
would have made

678
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:18,985
the underlying autoimmune
condition better.

679
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:20,752
Maybe it was never cancer
in the first place.

680
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,155
Of course it was cancer.
We biopsied.

681
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:26,424
It could have been
a false positive.

682
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,258
<i>Amyloidosis?</i>

683
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,627
His EKG voltage has been
on the low end of normal.

684
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:34,261
What if the tumors were actually
protein deposits?

685
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:37,529
G.I. biopsy to confirm,
chemo to treat.

686
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:38,763
<i>She's making that diagnosis</i>

687
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:40,632
based off of low-normal EKG.

688
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,904
<i>Low-normal is still normal.</i>

689
00:30:45,072 --> 00:30:46,539
That thing cannot be right.

690
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:48,140
<i>Low-normal is still low,</i>

691
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:49,508
<i>and that thing</i>
<i>does not have money</i>

692
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:50,743
riding on you being wrong,

693
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:51,611
<i>like the rest of us do.</i>

694
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:52,978
Chase fixed this.

695
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:54,779
Oh, I think you're confusing
Chase and Foreman.

696
00:30:54,847 --> 00:30:56,981
I used to do that
all the time.

697
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,416
I know it's rigged.

698
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,483
Because you're Mr. Cool?

699
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:00,951
Nothing could
possibly faze--

700
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:02,519
Because I took
a beta blocker!

701
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:16,964
<i>Both times, right?</i>

702
00:31:17,032 --> 00:31:18,832
His platelet count's
still low.

703
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,100
Chemo's still
a death sentence.

704
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,269
Treating for amyloid
with normal EKG

705
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:23,604
is like doing
heart surgery on a guy

706
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:25,340
because he's
ten pounds overweight.

707
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:26,708
It's insane.
<i>Well, we'll do it your way--</i>

708
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:28,509
go shout at the patient
till he gets better.

709
00:31:28,577 --> 00:31:30,911
G.I. biopsy to confirm,
chemo to treat.

710
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:41,587
Here's the dirty
little secret.

711
00:31:41,655 --> 00:31:43,322
I just think
we are who we are.

712
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:45,523
And I think
lotteries are stupid.

713
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:49,994
Janet...hemorrhoid?

714
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:58,502
That's not my name.
It's why I'm here.

715
00:31:58,636 --> 00:32:00,637
Oh, I see.
It goes across.

716
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:02,071
We better make this fast,

717
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:03,239
'cause I'm about to lose

718
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:04,707
my medical license
for malpractice.

719
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:06,208
It's nothing unusual.

720
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:08,810
The head of the hospital's
about to lose hers too.

721
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:19,753
I heard Cuddy quadrupled
your clinic hours.

722
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,687
Yeah,
but you know what?

723
00:32:20,754 --> 00:32:22,188
I'm flying through patients.

724
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:23,456
Arlene wants
another meeting.

725
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,825
I know. Told my seconds
to tell her seconds

726
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:27,860
that she gets
no second chance.

727
00:32:27,928 --> 00:32:29,362
Well, technically,
it's a third chance,

728
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:30,729
but I don't have thirds.

729
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:32,364
Cuddy told her the same thing,
more or less.

730
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:34,800
So you got us on
the same page after all.

731
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:36,635
I've been thinking
about your irrationality,

732
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:38,370
and I've come up with a rational
explanation for it.

733
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:39,772
That's quite a challenge.

734
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,607
You don't want
to let go of Cuddy,

735
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,776
so you're clinging
to the negative interaction,

736
00:32:43,843 --> 00:32:45,644
because some small part of you

737
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:47,913
thinks the bad stuff
beats nothing at all.

738
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,781
You're almost
making this work.

739
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:52,984
All you got to do now
is change reality.

740
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:54,719
Perhaps if I was
the one suing me.

741
00:32:54,787 --> 00:32:56,154
You didn't start it,

742
00:32:56,222 --> 00:32:58,057
but you had the chance
to end it, and you didn't.

743
00:32:58,124 --> 00:32:59,658
You love her, House,

744
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:01,026
and it's human to hang on,

745
00:33:01,094 --> 00:33:03,429
but you're blowing up
not just your job

746
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:07,199
but any chance of any kind
of relationship with her again.

747
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:19,044
Hi.

748
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:27,386
What's that?

749
00:33:27,454 --> 00:33:28,921
It's a check.

750
00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:31,224
For $10 million.

751
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,472
Uh, I don't know
what to say, I mean...

752
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,440
You already been
so generous.

753
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,408
By hiring you?

754
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:49,676
Yeah.

755
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:53,114
For a whopping six figures?
My own blood?

756
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:56,116
Best friend I ever had?

757
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:59,620
Year in, year out.

758
00:34:30,552 --> 00:34:34,187
You're wearing contacts
under your glasses?

759
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,323
I must have forgotten
to take them off when I--

760
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:37,391
They're tinted.

761
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,527
Do you change
your eye color?

762
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:43,631
Sometimes I like
to mix it up.

763
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,133
I don't understand.
What are you...

764
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:49,236
Wait, you--
you don't have brown eyes?

765
00:34:55,408 --> 00:35:00,378
Where'd the name
baby bear come from?

766
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:02,214
It's so long ago,
I don't...

767
00:35:02,282 --> 00:35:04,850
<i>It's a birthmark</i>
<i>on your left breast</i>

768
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:07,052
in the shape of a bear.

769
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,221
You forgot that?

770
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:16,996
It's the one thing
I never told you.

771
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:21,000
<i>That's why</i>
<i>she doesn't know.</i>

772
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:24,003
It's not like that.
I swear.

773
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:29,374
Get out.

774
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:31,076
Get out, both of you.

775
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:33,144
Come on, man.

776
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:34,612
<i>Get out.</i>

777
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,913
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

778
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,548
<i>Get out!</i>

779
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:40,551
Both of you!

780
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:48,493
You were right.

781
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,629
I'm just another
lottery fool.

782
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:56,301
My life sucks.
It'll always suck.

783
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,337
<i>He's crashing.</i>

784
00:35:58,404 --> 00:36:00,840
<i>Everything's shutting down.</i>

785
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:07,312
Patient had
a cardiac arrest,

786
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,826
and his lungs
and liver failed

787
00:36:08,857 --> 00:36:10,358
before we even
started the chemo.

788
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:12,760
Brain symptoms that
aren't brain symptoms,

789
00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:14,219
tumors that come and go?

790
00:36:14,237 --> 00:36:15,471
It's not amyloidosis.

791
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:18,006
You're forgetting alopecia.

792
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:19,107
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

793
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:20,475
I thought you were just

794
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:22,578
listing the things it's not,
alphabetically.

795
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:24,146
His long lost love
is a fraud.

796
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:25,214
<i>Thirteen figured that out.</i>

797
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:26,281
Good for her.

798
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:27,816
<i>Decades of menial work,</i>

799
00:36:27,884 --> 00:36:30,318
three cancers couldn't
make him die miserable.

800
00:36:30,386 --> 00:36:31,419
She just did.

801
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,854
The truth
made him miserable.

802
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:36,057
It's like
there's two of me.

803
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,795
Keep the clinic shut down.

804
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:41,996
But wherever it is,

805
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:43,798
it's isolated to the
administrative floor.

806
00:36:43,865 --> 00:36:46,234
I'm not gonna
evacuate the whole...

807
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:55,041
Only way to get
the two of you

808
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:57,576
in the same place
at the same time.

809
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,146
Reopen everything.

810
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:04,782
Readmit everyone. Now.

811
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,751
I want you both to know
I'm filing the suit today,

812
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:10,286
delivering the paperwork
to your counsel's office.

813
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:11,487
<i>You have to be destructive.</i>

814
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:12,888
You have to tear things apart.

815
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:14,422
God forbid you should say

816
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,524
what's really on
that twisted mind of yours?

817
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:18,025
And you're the great
peacemaker?

818
00:37:18,092 --> 00:37:21,460
Single mom, can't keep a man
long enough to cook a meal.

819
00:37:21,528 --> 00:37:25,064
You'd be dead if it weren't
for our mistreatment.

820
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:27,266
And somehow you'd still find
something to whine about.

821
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:29,036
We'll let the court
decide who's whining,

822
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:30,537
since you're so sure--

823
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:33,540
We're not getting
back together.

824
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,942
What are you talking about?

825
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,044
It's the only explanation.

826
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:39,745
Why she keeps making threats

827
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:43,782
without ever filing her stupid,
yet completely valid lawsuit.

828
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,116
Why she ripped up her will,

829
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:47,885
why she kicked half
the hospital out on the street.

830
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:50,821
She wants us united
against her.

831
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:54,157
This is her drawing blood

832
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:57,427
over the latest of a long line
of imaginary slights.

833
00:37:57,495 --> 00:38:01,264
She doesn't care if anyone
else is happy for a single--

834
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:08,137
Look at you idiots.

835
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:10,606
Who else is gonna put up
with either of you?

836
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,512
I asked you to move in.

837
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,382
That meant we weren't
gonna reconcile.

838
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:29,088
I'm sorry, mom.

839
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:35,361
Some things take more
than a common enemy.

840
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:38,768
Then you're an idiot
with impossible standards.

841
00:38:54,285 --> 00:38:57,153
Common enemy.

842
00:38:57,221 --> 00:38:59,222
One way to trigger
brain symptoms

843
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,424
when there's nothing wrong
with your brain

844
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:04,326
have something else turn
your brain into a common enemy.

845
00:39:04,394 --> 00:39:06,262
You have a teratoma,

846
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:09,565
a usually harmless
congenital growth

847
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:12,500
which can be filled with
almost any kind of tissue.

848
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:15,570
And, <i>unusually,</i>
not at all harmless.

849
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:18,473
If I'm right, yours is filled
with primitive cells,

850
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:20,945
some of which developed
into brain cells.

851
00:39:21,013 --> 00:39:23,615
These foreign cells
leaked into your bloodstream.

852
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:26,618
Now, the body
is a little xenophobic.

853
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:28,454
It creates antibodies.

854
00:39:28,522 --> 00:39:29,889
The problem is,
there's not much difference

855
00:39:29,956 --> 00:39:31,524
between brain cells
in your abdomen

856
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:33,025
and brain cells in your brain.

857
00:39:33,093 --> 00:39:34,760
To make matters worse,

858
00:39:34,828 --> 00:39:38,064
primitive cells can become
almost anything.

859
00:39:38,131 --> 00:39:39,565
Grow like weeds.

860
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:41,932
Which means they
can turn into tumors,

861
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,803
destroy whole organ systems.

862
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,304
But the cancer?

863
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:49,739
<i>Was cancer.</i>

864
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,675
Just growing so fast it
collapsed under its own weight.

865
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:55,944
Am I gonna live?

866
00:39:56,012 --> 00:39:59,114
Cut out the teratoma,
what's left of your cancer,

867
00:39:59,182 --> 00:40:01,483
you should be fine.

868
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:04,419
Think of it as
your second luckiest day.

869
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,588
It's hard to feel lucky.

870
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,358
The woman I love
was a fraud.

871
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:12,762
No, actually a fraud

872
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:15,464
You fell for her
just the same.

873

You may stay miserable,

874
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,802

is not gonna be the reason why.

Or at least
the only one to show up

892
00:41:54,631 --> 00:41:56,565
who actually has
the birthmark.

893
00:41:56,633 --> 00:42:00,068
He's renting her
an apartment.

894
00:42:00,136 --> 00:42:01,803
It'll end horribly.

895
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:04,540
Not for him.

896
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,942
She may take all his money,

897
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,145
and he may be a naive idiot,
but...

898
00:42:10,213 --> 00:42:11,813
He'll always be hopeful,

899
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:17,486
so he'll always be happy.

900
00:42:17,554 --> 00:42:19,622
You lost your mother.

901
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,391
You euthanized
your brother.

902
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,562
You got the life expectancy
of a pretty good sitcom.

903
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,131
If you can convince yourself

904
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,499
that you'd be miserable
no matter what

905
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:29,867
even without all that stuff,

906
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:33,071
then maybe you don't have
to hate the universe

907
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:37,610
for dumping
a giant turd on you.

908
00:42:37,678 --> 00:42:42,650
Fatalism is your
survival mechanism.

909
00:42:42,717 --> 00:42:45,854
And you?

910
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:47,756
Dumped by everyone
you've ever loved.

911
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:49,291
Rehab was a bust.

912
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,462
Your leg feels like somebody
took a giant bite out of it.

913
00:42:55,466 --> 00:42:58,536
We are who we are.

914
00:42:58,603 --> 00:43:00,138
Lotteries are stupid.
