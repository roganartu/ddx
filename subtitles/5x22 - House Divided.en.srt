1
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,035
145 pounds!

2
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,038
Johnson! Miller!

3
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,979
House - Season 5 Episode 22
"House Divided"

4
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,009
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm

5
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:10,337
The HTeam's AnonymHouse

6
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:24,128
I know you're not asleep.

7
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:27,377
That insight
would be a lot more impressive

8
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:30,676
if you weren't just a product
of my exhausted brain.

9
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:34,381
Aren't you curious
about why I'm here?

10
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:41,079
Curious why no french maid's outfit.

11
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,204
No spanky pants.

12
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:46,413
I'm a hallucination...
not a fantasy.

13
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:49,314
It's insomnia.

14
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:52,201
Four nights without rem sleep
can cause...

15
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:54,313
That might explain
why you're hallucinating.

16
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:57,885
Doesn't explain why you're hallucinating
Wilson's dead girlfriend.

17
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,613
Probably just my secret

18
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:02,288
and very unconscious desire
to get Wilson into my bedroom.

19
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,390
Or maybe your guilt
of Kutner's suicide

20
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:06,852
reminds you how guilty
you felt about me.

21
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,535
Who cares why you're here?

22
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,691
A decent night's sleep,
you won't be.

23
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:24,194
Guess I'll be around
a few more hours.

24
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,964
Need some coffee?

25
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:38,431
Addictive substances
are no substitute

26
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:40,356
for nature's healing balm.

27
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:42,811
Let's make this fast.
I need to sleep.

28
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:46,186
Deaf 14-year-old started
hearing imaginary explosions.

29
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:49,807
Exploding head syndrome.

30
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:51,202
Cool.

31
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:53,399
Obviously his brain
knows how to hear.

32
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:56,308
Patient went deaf at age four.
Complication of meningitis.

33
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,283
So why no cochlear implant?

34
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:00,780
Usual suspects are insomnia,

35
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:03,016
which he doesn't have,
migraines, which he doesn't get,

36
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:05,327
and head trauma
which didn't show up on the ct.

37
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:07,334
Damn imaginary pen.

38
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,124
Mom's signature's on everything.

39
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:12,891
- Did the dad die?
- I doubt it.

40
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:15,299
He was a sperm donor.
Medical records couldn't be cleaner.

41
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:17,327
We're left with
temporal lobe seizure.

42
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:18,212
Wrong.

43
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:20,703
Someone at the wrestling meet
would have noticed a seizure.

44
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,835
Could have just looked like
a bad shot to the leg.

45
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,319
Put him in the seizure lab.

46
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:26,931
See if his head blows up
all over again.

47
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:29,750
You're gonna ignore
your own subconscious?

48
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:32,384
Gonna be the limp leading the blind.

49
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,450
I need a'scrip, for sleeping pills.

50
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,910
My neighbor's dog's
been keeping me awake,

51
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,420
and seems strangely
invulnerable to poison.

52
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:53,542
Why is the soon-to-be-
second-prettiest dr. Chase here?

53
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:55,669
I'll take that as a congratulations.

54
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,421
We're discussing a case.

55
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,802
Why did he close that file?

56
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:04,136
Wedding in two weeks?
I'd say you were pregnant,

57
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,163
but I don't think Chase's body
is mature enough to produce sperm.

58
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:09,308
It's a small ceremony.
Why wait?

59
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:12,387
Nighty night.

60
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,022
Drugs with no lecture?

61
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,497
He wants you out.

62
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:19,699
Interesting case?

63
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,695
Possible prostate cancer
came into the e.r.

64
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,863
Pencil cup.

65
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,331
No wonder his prostate's enlarged.

66
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:35,292
It's full of pool cues and cigars.

67
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:37,920
Chase's best man doesn't get here
till the day of the wedding,

68
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,130
I asked Wilson to throw
his bachelor party.

69
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,591
No retired ministers
available to plan it?

70
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,169
Chase doesn't want some big,
raucous party.

71
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:46,585
So she says.

72
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,681
Luckily,
there are people in this world

73
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,516
ready to stand up for what's right.

74
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:52,615
No, no, I don't...
I don't want you to...

75
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,690
Listen, two things I do well.

76
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:58,389
Bachelor parties rank
towards the top.

77
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,826
I get to help, right?

78
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,651
Starting five hertz.

79
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:13,270
House made it through
that entire differential

80
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:16,469
without mocking our patient
for not having a cochlear implant.

81
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:20,743
The patient doesn't want an implant
because he's comfortable with who he is.

82
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,715
- It's admirable.
- He's deaf.

83
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,467
It's not an identity,
it's a disability.

84
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:26,926
It's also a culture.

85
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:29,096
The deaf have their own schools,
their own language.

86
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,557
Still no spiking.

87
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,808
Going to 20.

88
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,702
Anything I can simulate
with a $3.00 pair of ear plugs

89
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:38,177
is not a culture.

90
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,002
No sign of seizure.

91
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:42,860
Temporal lobe activity
is still clean.

92
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,696
Doctors... doctors, he can't see.

93
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,281
One of his eyes.

94
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,029
The limp leading the blind.

95
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,466
Is that supposed to mean something?

96
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,711
I didn't think so.

97
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,958
So exploding head syndrome,
plus vision loss.

98
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,575
Subclavian steal syndrome.

99
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,962
Vascular defect coupled
with constant arm movement

100
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,755
could siphon blood flow
from the brain.

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,564
- We should do an angio, check his...
- Knock yourselves out.

102
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:18,572
How did I know
he was gonna go blind?

103
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:22,137
Don't get cute, gazoo.

104
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:24,182
You're in my mind.
You're obviously there.

105
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:25,757
C-reactive protein.

106
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:29,094
I noticed in his file
it was slightly elevated.

107
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:31,064
I figured the stress
of the seizure lab

108
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,035
would drive
inflammation even higher,

109
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,878
lead to optic neuritis.

110
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:37,964
That's a lot clearer than
"the limp leading the blind."

111
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,501
It was just a glimmer.
I couldn't put it into words.

112
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,336
It was a long shot.

113
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:45,506
I don't even remember
the c-reactive protein level.

114
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:48,926
Obviously you do.
You just don't know it.

115
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,096
How high is k2?

116
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:53,722
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

117
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,942
But I read a book about it
years ago.

118
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:58,777
Fierce, sexy sherpa
on the cover, bending over...

119
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:00,972
28,251 feet.

120
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:03,938
Cool.

121
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,361
An all-access pass to my own brain.

122
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:11,357
Go play the kid some music.

123
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:12,241
Why?

124
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,106
Another long shot.

125
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,913
We're using iodine dye
to track blood flow

126
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,631
in your neck and arm.

127
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,529
House, what are you doing?

128
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:48,834
What does it look like I'm doing?

129
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,409
Fighting the power.

130
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:02,055
Feel that?

131
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,042
How cool is that?

132
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:08,422
Apparently your mom doesn't
care what you're missing.

133
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,969
You're an ass.

134
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:14,893
He says he feels the vibrations
in his abdomen, but not his hands.

135
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:17,443
What does that mean?

136
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:23,174
It's a new symptom.

137
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,360
Neuropathy.

138
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,528
Thought you were gonna
get some sleep.

139
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:39,525
Case got interesting.

140
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,465
Like the zoo.

141
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:55,984
Except you can bang on the glass
as much as you want.

142
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,732
- How did you know about the neuropathy?
- Good question.

143
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:00,557
Enough with the riddles.

144
00:10:00,796 --> 00:10:02,146
Tell me about it.

145
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,048
Think "wrestling record."

146
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,356
Juggling.

147
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,132
No, pins.

148
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:11,307
Three pins.

149
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,453
Patient was pinned
in his last three matches.

150
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,428
Leading up to that, he was 15 and 0.

151
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:19,675
I figured his balance was off
from diminished sensation.

152
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,106
Could be increased icp
from a brain tumor.

153
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,919
That we missed on the head ct?

154
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:27,215
Cutting weight for wrestling
could have led to rhabdomyolysis.

155
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,342
He just went up
a weight class three months ago.

156
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:31,767
Foreman's right.

157
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,959
Actually, increased icp
could make sense.

158
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:40,692
- You just said...
- I was processing.

159
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:48,608
It also puts a new symptom
on the table.

160
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:50,446
His deafness.

161
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:53,596
What if it was caused by nf2 cancer

162
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:55,476
instead of his childhood meningitis?

163
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,293
So meningitis was a coincidence?

164
00:10:57,418 --> 00:11:00,681
Or a byproduct of the cancer
suppressing his immune system.

165
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:01,840
Mri his head.

166
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,538
If you're right about nf2,
his deafness may be reversible.

167
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:07,171
I'll set it up
and talk to the patient.

168
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:10,592
You two... doing anything?

169
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:26,643
You know what a broken cowboy is?

170
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:29,557
It was on House's
list of requirements.

171
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,231
I have three theories.

172
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:35,204
Why is House so into
this bachelor party thing?

173
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,529
He needs to have a reason
to be into a bachelor party?

174
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:39,612
He needs a reason
to be into anything.

175
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:40,949
Give me your wallet.

176
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:45,955
House could be trying
to tempt chase into cheating.

177
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,456
- Break them up.
- You think House is into Cameron?

178
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,133
I think House is into Cameron
being into him.

179
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:53,835
Marrying Chase
would shatter that fantasy.

180
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:57,173
If he cheats, they shouldn't be
getting married in the first place.

181
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:58,740
So you're okay with House

182
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:01,233
getting Chase smashed enough
to make a stupid mistake?

183
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:04,308
Being drunk doesn't change who you are.
It just reveals it.

184
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:11,452
You think she can do
the broken cowboy?

185
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:12,827
God, I hope so.

186
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:16,258
Nf2 is an extremely
slow-growing cancer,

187
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:18,093
which makes it very treatable.

188
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:20,454
If we're right, taking out the tumor

189
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,629
means there's a chance
you'll regain your hearing.

190
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:31,875
He said you have to.

191
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:34,758
What's wrong?

192
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:37,631
He wants you to treat
the cancer, but leave him deaf.

193
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,920
Sorry.
Doesn't work like that.

194
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:13,181
Imaging shows slightly elevated icp,

195
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,466
but no masses
on or around the nerves.

196
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:16,891
It's not cancer.

197
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:19,855
Slight bowing in the wall
of the fourth ventricle.

198
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,457
- Could still indicate a tumor.
- We brought pictures.

199
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,650
The fact that you sent me
on a scouting mission...

200
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:25,775
No skirts.

201
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,193
You're not on the guest list.

202
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,757
Bachelor parties are an ancient
and sacred male rite of passage.

203
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:35,544
The ventricle bowing is most likely
a pre-existing anatomical anomaly,

204
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,607
not the indication of a tumor.

205
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:39,698
No way to know for sure
without a brain biopsy.

206
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:43,071
If I get drunk enough, there's a chance
I might make out with one of strippers.

207
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,439
Or become one.

208
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:45,824
Sold.

209
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,869
We can't just drill into
our patient's brain on a hunch.

210
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:52,017
Oh, god, not her.

211
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,331
She's the one that got me
hooked in with madoff.

212
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:57,949
- Taub's right. It's not cancer.
- Yeah, by all means,

213
00:13:58,074 --> 00:14:01,470
abandon a great diagnostic theory
because it's difficult to prove.

214
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:04,801
Do a biopsy. We need to take
a better look at his fourth ventricle.

215
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:06,303
Or an older look.

216
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,351
The mom's never gonna let us
touch his brain without some evidence.

217
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:12,017
Patient broke his nose years ago.
Hospital could have done an mri.

218
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,274
The main reason
my third wife and I eloped

219
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,749
was to avoid House's bachelor party.

220
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,553
Have you seen caligula?

221
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,671
My patient's brain now...

222
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:39,818
versus three years ago.

223
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:41,651
See any difference?

224
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,064
Is he telling you
to avoid the party?

225
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:46,998
I took an oath to do no harm.

226
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:48,473
Sure, don't come.

227
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:51,933
If you want your wedding vows
to be meaningless.

228
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,939
This should be interesting.

229
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:56,900
You are going to commit

230
00:14:57,025 --> 00:15:00,649
to that one special woman
forever, which is beautiful.

231
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,322
But if your commitment
the day after the wedding is the same

232
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:06,126
as your commitment the day before,
then the wedding meant nothing.

233
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:09,138
So, and I see
no logical way around this,

234
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:11,066
if you want your marriage to matter,

235
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:12,774
you have to be a wanton, trolling,

236
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,663
muck-covered pig the day before.

237
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,320
You're evil.

238
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:18,606
See ya.

239
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:20,665
The wall of the fourth
ventricle changed.

240
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,776
It isn't bowed in the older scan.

241
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,551
Evidence of nf2, right?

242
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:28,312
You'd need to do
a brain biopsy to confirm.

243
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm not going to the bachelor party.

244
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:37,852
Every time I go
to one of your parties,

245
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,595
I end up embarrassing myself
in some...

246
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,274
new and unexpected way.

247
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:45,360
That whole thing with
the duck was hardly unexpected.

248
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,618
I'm not going.

249
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:50,419
It's not okay.

250
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,832
Do you know who we need?

251
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,290
That stripper you got
for wilson's bachelor party.

252
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:03,676
You could do body shots
right off her.

253
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:05,171
Why go back to that well?

254
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:07,173
In the nine years
since Wilson's party,

255
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,047
a whole new generation of hot girls

256
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:11,136
have been abused
by their stepfathers.

257
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,512
She loved cats.

258
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:16,725
What made you remember
the stripper loved cats?

259
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:19,214
Chase has a cat.

260
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:21,227
They'll bond.

261
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,233
You, entertaining yourself up there?

262
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,739
Just rehearsing
for the revival of evita.

263
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:33,515
- What'd you find?
- The biopsy shows nerve inflammation

264
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,785
consistent with increased
intracranial pressure.

265
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:38,121
Something's wrong,
but it's not cancer.

266
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,501
He's gonna go through life deaf.

267
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:47,047
- He's okay with that.
- He has no idea what he's missing.

268
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,424
His mom's a moron.

269
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:52,260
He's gonna pay for her stupidity
for the rest of his life?

270
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,279
Are we okay with that?

271
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:04,522
Why are you closing?
Let's put in a cochlear implant.

272
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:06,890
That wasn't in the paperwork.

273
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,208
Really? Well, someone
must have screwed up.

274
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,933
I'll go track it down.

275
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:12,906
- I'll wait.
- That's a great idea.

276
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:15,247
Let the kid spend more time
under anesthesia

277
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:17,211
with his skull cracked open.

278
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:18,753
I'll wait.

279
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,040
I have been known to lie
to serve my own agenda.

280
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,069
An implant does absolutely
nothing to help me diagnose him.

281
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:30,977
Let's get an implant tray in here.

282
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:00,159
Just...
just try to relax.

283
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,491
Just during the recovery phase...

284
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,291
Her son didn't want the implant.

285
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,093
If he still doesn't want it after
having time to adjust, I'll take it out.

286
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,054
I'll blind him too,
if he wants to experience that culture.

287
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,681
Remove it now.

288
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:22,642
Kid's just had brain surgery.
He's not stable.

289
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:24,711
Ms. Miller,

290
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:27,738
I'm not trying to minimize
dr. House's wrong doing.

291
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:29,774
- But the best thing...
- Why is she sitting?

292
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,695
She's not yelling,
not threatening, not pacing.

293
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:35,488
Just sitting.

294
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,098
Understand, dr. House?

295
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:41,651
Focus.

296
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:44,589
I need you to say
you accept the arrangement.

297
00:18:44,714 --> 00:18:45,764
No problem.

298
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:47,959
You're not mad.

299
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:50,295
I'm mad.

300
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,088
Not mad enough.

301
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:54,257
You wanted your son to hear.

302
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,135
You just didn't have the guts
to make him get the implant.

303
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,862
Once my son is stable,

304
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:00,764
I want that thing out of his head.

305
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:13,009
- Why did you do this?
- Because he is ignorant,

306
00:19:13,134 --> 00:19:14,761
and he's being raised by an idiot.

307
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,186
Not good enough.

308
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:17,948
You always have...

309
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,533
My patient is opting
into a handicap!

310
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:24,562
It's an insult to all the other
gimps out there.

311
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,836
But I'm still putting Foreman
in charge of the case.

312
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:33,462
That's the arrangement?

313
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:47,315
You're okay with Foreman in charge?

314
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:49,971
Who you calling?

315
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:52,357
Oh... right, you don't want
to look like a lunatic.

316
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,932
Yeah, about that...

317
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:56,035
You think we did the wrong thing?

318
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,310
I'm not sure.

319
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:00,089
I'm not even sure why we did it.

320
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:02,497
That argument you made to Cuddy
sounded pretty good.

321
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:03,822
To you, maybe.

322
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:15,374
I figured by now you'd be at the board
in your monocle and jodhpurs.

323
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,041
You did something stupid.
Quick, better mock someone.

324
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:19,738
Why did you do it?

325
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,767
Why did I give a human being
the power of hearing?

326
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:25,431
You ask god the same question,
he'll give you the same answer.

327
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:28,852
Patient has a fever now too.

328
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,788
Probably just a post-op
complication.

329
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:32,814
- Arnold-chiari?
- Not without muscle weakness.

330
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,195
Pseudotumor cerebri?

331
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,649
We checked his eyes before the surgery.
No papilledema.

332
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:37,527
Candy?

333
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,149
I'm pretty sure Wilson's stripper's name
was something sweet.

334
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,493
Maybe his fever is more than
the post-op reaction.

335
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:49,139
His girlfriend was sick  months ago.
Maybe her flu was really Epstein-Barr.

336
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,669
- Lolli?
- They swap spit,

337
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:52,875
virus goes to his brain, leads to
meningitis,

338
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,460
increased intracranial pressure.

339
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:55,910
I agree. Taffy?

340
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,371
I agree.

341
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:01,926
Go ahead, start him on Rivavirin
for Epstein-Barr.

342
00:21:02,524 --> 00:21:03,970
Keep making decisions like that.

343
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,781
It really bolsters the illusion
that you're in charge.

344
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:13,109
Why aren't you in my office?

345
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:16,065
Because I know
what the word "my" means.

346
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:17,775
I did something insane,

347
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:19,861
and you're not all over me
analyzing why.

348
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:23,898
It was nice.

349
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:29,162
I gave that idiot an implant
to prove to him what an idiot he's been.

350
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,682
- How is that nice?
- You didn't do it to solve the case.

351
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:35,437
You didn't do it to save his life.
You... did it to make his life better.

352
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:38,303
It was a caring act.
Which you did in a way that was...

353
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:40,519
immoral and illegal, but...

354
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:42,842
baby steps.

355
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:44,885
Doesn't sound like us.

356
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:47,624
You can't make me go
to the bachelor party.

357
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:49,533
I know.

358
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:53,478
- And you're okay with that?
- What choice do I have?

359
00:21:57,489 --> 00:21:59,278


360
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:02,319


361
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:04,030


362
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:07,302


363
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:13,074
Please, God.

364
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:17,793


365
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:20,664
"Seth"?

366
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,671


367
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:24,884


368
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:30,056


369
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:04,937
I think he just wet the bed.

370
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:29,466
The kid's dehydrated, but stable.

371
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,910
Thankfully, the fountain of whiz
seems to have stopped for the moment.

372
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:37,248
Not before hosing
Epstein-Barr off the table.

373
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:38,676
Now eat up.

374
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:42,112
We're gonna pick out the ice cream
flavors for the bachelor party.

375
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:45,557
Could be systemic
autoimmune disease.

376
00:23:46,563 --> 00:23:47,613
Sarcoido...

377
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:50,408
this tastes like... vodka.

378
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,565
It'd be stupid
if it tasted like bourbon.

379
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,391
- That's the brown one.
- It is vodka?

380
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:57,905
Flash frozen in a secret process.

381
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:00,861
Guy figured it out in his basement.

382
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,841
Lemoncello.

383
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,277
Genius.

384
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,730
Symptoms came on too hard and too fast.
Sarcoidosis is progressive.

385
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,646
Remember in med school,
when Donovan gave grand rounds?

386
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:17,580
There was that guy
who was peeing liters.

387
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:19,271
Glomerulonephritis?

388
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:21,818
A wrestler... steroids could
have damaged the kidneys.

389
00:24:23,018 --> 00:24:25,797
- The scotch is nice.
- His urine would have been brown.

390
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,088
Donovan
ruled out osmotic diuresis...

391
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,760
kidney disease.

392
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:32,220
- Pheochromocytoma?
- No hypertension.

393
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,598
- Plasma metanephrine's normal.
- Devic's?

394
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,430
It happened at night.

395
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:37,774
That was the clue.

396
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:40,271
Night, recumbent body position,

397
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,263
changes in B.P.

398
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:47,345
It's his heart.

399
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:51,945
Run a 12-lead EKG,
watch him for four hours.

400
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:53,366
Foreman concurs.

401
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,057
What the hell just happened?

402
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,351
Everything started to fade away.

403
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,627
You're getting better at focusing.

404
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:06,921
Ignoring everything
that doesn't matter.

405
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,101
He looks pissed.

406
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:13,489
I think he might hit us.

407
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:15,971
Is your eyesight better than mine?

408
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,259
We need to talk about
the bachelor party.

409
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:21,556
Excellent topic choice.

410
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:23,658
Surgery's so boring,

411
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:25,648
and my lying to you
is just so yesterday.

412
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,185
It's my fault for letting you
talk me into the implant.

413
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,533
Cameron is not gonna be happy
about this party.

414
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:32,011
But you, on the other hand...

415
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:34,616
plan on spending the rest
of my life with Cameron.

416
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,373
So... I need
to cancel the fart band?

417
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:39,818
So... I need you to kidnap me.

418
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:43,867
Spoken like a true Aussie.

419
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:47,025
By the way, if you know where
I can get me the sheet music

420
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,750
to waltzing Matilda...

421
00:25:53,277 --> 00:25:54,478
Want some ice cream?

422
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,799
We're having a sundae bar.

423
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,245
Sweet.

424
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,670
That's her name.

425
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:04,562
Sundae or bar?

426
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:06,161
Karamel.

427
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:09,073
With a "k".

428
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:17,200


429
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,911
{\You don't need one.
No one does.}

430
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,268


431
00:26:22,393 --> 00:26:23,676


432
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:25,367


433
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:29,783


434
00:26:29,908 --> 00:26:31,377


435
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:36,677


436
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,839
Bathroom?

437
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:47,480
Down the hall,
two doors on your right.

438
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,206
Thank you.

439
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:54,162
Do I...

440
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,263
sound like...

441
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,032
her?

442
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,056
It takes time.

443
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,173
You still haven't slept?

444
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:18,657
And then I have a clever response.

445
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:21,146
EKG, normal sinus, normal intervals.

446
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,357
- His heart's fine.
- His heart's not fine.

447
00:27:24,103 --> 00:27:26,708
The heart was fine during this test.

448
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,187
The arrhythmia's hiding.

449
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:31,342
- Or we were wrong about the heart.
- Could be the thyroid.

450
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,109
Hashimodo's would explain
the kid's urine and brain pressure.

451
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,280
- Treadmill.
- Or the arrhythmia is hiding.

452
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:41,120
We need to stress him.
Put the patient on a treadmill.

453
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:42,894
The patient just had brain surgery.

454
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,202
A stress test could cause
a brain bleed and kill him.

455
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:46,657
I value your opinion.

456
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:48,624
I value rejecting your opinion.

457
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,263
You're not doing this.
You haven't been sleeping.

458
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,497
Cuddy doesn't actually
want you in charge.

459
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:57,168
She just wants to avoid a lawsuit
and to win an NAACP award.

460
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:00,804
And if I let you risk our patient's life
testing an organ we already tested,

461
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,179
we accomplish neither.

462
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:04,172
Run a thyroid panel.

463
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:14,473
How do we get him into the stress lab
without Foreman's sign-off?

464
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:16,076
We could kill Foreman.

465
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:17,948
Is she new?

466
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:19,676
Focus.

467
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:22,527
The lab simulates stress.

468
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:24,462
What if it's not simulated?

469
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,731
- We could tell himhe's been dumped.
- That's a tough sell.

470
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,367
She never leaves the room
for more than five minutes.

471
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:31,892
We could kill her.

472
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:34,238
Or... asthma meds.

473
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,300
- Force the heart to beat faster.
- Revealing the arrhythmia.

474
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:41,802
- Nice idea.
- It was yours.

475
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,804
I left the room for a few minutes.
He ripped out his implant.

476
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:56,591
So much for improving his life.

477
00:28:57,258 --> 00:28:59,369
Actually, I think we just saved it.

478
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,398
Look at that.

479
00:29:05,198 --> 00:29:06,142
Arrhythmia.

480
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:13,834
You were right about the heart.
Should have listened to you.

481
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:16,648
The correct phrasing would be,

482
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:18,396
"I should always listen to you".

483
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,007
He's got problems everywhere.

484
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:21,842
What goes everywhere?

485
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:24,082
Blood. Could be thrombocythemia.

486
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:27,390
- Excess platelets lead to clotting.
- Not with a normal platelet count.

487
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:30,634
So it doesn't start in the blood,
but in the lungs. Pulmonary embolism.

488
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,687
Should do a VQ scan,
see if his lungs are clear.

489
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:46,030
Go.

490
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:00,869
You sure I did this
at Wilson's party?

491
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:03,822
The last time, you used grain alcohol
instead of the sambuca.

492
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:05,469
And it worked?

493
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:18,424
Explains my lack of eyebrows
by the end of the evening.

494
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:25,226
By the power of greyskull, I...

495
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,586
This is why we're rehearsing.

496
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,478
Ever wonder what's happening

497
00:30:41,603 --> 00:30:43,608
every time our patient gets sicker?

498
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:46,357
- Not right now!
- First symptom, wrestling.

499
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:47,673
Then,

500
00:30:47,995 --> 00:30:49,764
under the lights
of the seizure lab...

501
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,125
Are you going somewhere,
because this feels...

502
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,108
Keep doing what you're doing.
It helps.

503
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:56,395
Then, under the stress
of blindness...

504
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,047
and post-op fever.

505
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,299
What do all the symptoms
have in common?

506
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:05,777
Heat.

507
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:12,166
See, if you hadn't been here,
that would have popped into my head.

508
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,269
Which actually would have
been way cooler.

509
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:18,876
Foreman, kid's
got Uhthoff phenomenon.

510
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:22,713
Which means it's MS.
Start him on double-dose interferon.

511
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:24,711
Let's get our drink on.

512
00:31:24,836 --> 00:31:27,927
Not before I've added "chemical burns"
to this guy's cause of death.

513
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:33,521
He's responding to interferon.
I can retire as department figurehead.

514
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:38,938
We're with the department
of citizenship and immigration.

515
00:31:39,348 --> 00:31:41,629
Did you recently apply
for a marriage license?

516
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:45,283
According to our records,
your work permit is expired.

517
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,861
- If you could come with us.
- I'm his <i>fiancée</i>.

518
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:50,824
- I can come along and clear this...
- I'm sorry, ma'am. Illegals only.

519
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:54,739
I'm sure it's a mistake.

520
00:31:54,864 --> 00:31:56,951
I'll call you as soon
as I know what's going on.

521
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,994
Don't let House get him
in too much trouble.

522
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:29,071
Allow me to welcome you

523
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:31,490
to the best night of your life.

524
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,845
Now, a few ground rules
for the evening.

525
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:50,325
Safety is job one.

526
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:53,784
We've now gone 18 days without
an injury in the workplace.

527
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,933
These girls are all working their way
through law school.

528
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:00,561
- Don't test them.
- House.

529
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,301
I knew you couldn't stay away.

530
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,078
This is my apartment.

531
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,656
You can't do this.

532
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,487
Clearly, reality begs to differ.

533
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:18,583
Where's my furniture?

534
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:20,811
Out back somewhere.

535
00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:34,408
How's your wife?

536
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:36,680
We got divorced.

537
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:39,475
- How is your cat?
- Dead.

538
00:33:41,784 --> 00:33:43,362
How'bout we go have a drink?

539
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:28,649
You're okay with this?

540
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:30,470
I paid 50 bucks for this.

541
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:33,306
You guys are great together.
Trust is everything.

542
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,591
I gotta get some air.

543
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,247
Keep it real.

544
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:57,174
You should be out there...

545
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:59,868
enjoying the lap dances
of your labors.

546
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:03,915
I kind of like it in here.

547
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:06,081
Me too.

548
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:11,109
To us figuring out M.S.

549
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,278
And the blindness
and neuropathy and arrhythmia

550
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:16,836
and anything else we did.

551
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:22,694
What exactly did my team do?

552
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,270
Look good in their lab coats.

553
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:28,208
Except for Taub.

554
00:35:29,865 --> 00:35:31,942
Some people just
work better alone...

555
00:35:32,345 --> 00:35:33,367
so to speak.

556
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:37,509
- One more drink.
- No! I can't!

557
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,416
I need to take a break.

558
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:41,376
Meet Karamel.

559
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,769
Maybe one more drink.

560
00:35:57,307 --> 00:35:58,707
What's that taste?

561
00:35:59,232 --> 00:36:00,232
Is that...

562
00:36:01,273 --> 00:36:02,785
is that strawberry?

563
00:36:08,436 --> 00:36:09,936
House, you in there?

564
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,326
Use the other bathroom.

565
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,652
It's in the kitchen.
Looks like a sink.

566
00:36:14,777 --> 00:36:16,796
Chase went into anaphylactic shock

567
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:19,266
from the stripper's body butter
or something.

568
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,320
Is he okay?

569
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,763
One of the residents
had an epipen, so he's fine.

570
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:25,849
We're taking him to the hospital
to be safe.

571
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,778
I knew that Chase was
allergic to strawberries, didn't I?

572
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:42,930
That's why you wanted Karamel
at this party.

573
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:45,382
I suggested Karamel

574
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:47,525
'cause she was great
at Wilson's party.

575
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:51,596
I knew about her body butter
and about his strawberry allergy.

576
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:55,965
I tried to kill Chase.

577
00:36:58,112 --> 00:36:59,258
Why would I do that?

578
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,301
I don't want Cameron.

579
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:04,888
You're not a big fan of other
people's happiness, either.

580
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:15,846
You confirm?

581
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:22,444
That kid we saved...

582
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,949
he's dying.

583
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,290
It's not M.S.

584
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:28,762
We were wrong.

585
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,649
Thank god you're okay.
What happened?

586
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,222
- It was a good...
- Long story.

587
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:40,896
Your patient's lung failure
rules out M.S.

588
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:42,759
We put him on a ventilator.

589
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,569
- Enlarged lymphs could...
- Are any of you sober?

590
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,754
Turn around.
You need to go to the hospital.

591
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:55,332
I need to sleep.

592
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:01,698
I'm you.

593
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:04,656
You can't just shut a door.

594
00:38:05,178 --> 00:38:06,878
You tried to kill Chase.

595
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,852
I need to push you back down.

596
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:11,300
You're dangerous.

597
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:14,430
That's the hospital.

598
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:15,542
Not answering.

599
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,799
I'm here with your team,

600
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:24,465
trying to sober them up

601
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,429
so they can... help treat
your dying patient.

602
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,264
Foreman's dying patient.

603
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,977
What causes lung failure
plus your patient's previous symptoms?

604
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,054
Eosinophilic pneumonitis.

605
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:38,900
White blood cells accumulate,
clog up the lungs,

606
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,068
lead to heart problems.
It fits.

607
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,736
Are you there?

608
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:46,365
It's not eosinophilic pneumonitis.

609
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,935
<i>I gotta crash.</i>

610
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:50,744
- Don't hang up. We need your help.
- <i>I can't.</i>

611
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:52,518
We can solve this.

612
00:38:57,828 --> 00:39:00,201
Eosinophilic pneumonitis
could actually make sense.

613
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,966
No, House ruled it out because it would
affect the larynx. Patient would be...

614
00:39:06,463 --> 00:39:07,344
hoarse,

615
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,347
which we wouldn't notice
in a deaf kid who rarely speaks.

616
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:13,275
Wait.

617
00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:15,435
Everyone's getting breath mints.

618
00:39:18,616 --> 00:39:20,139
We need to hear Seth speak.

619
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:24,373
But that means taking out the tube.
Isn't that dangerous?

620
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:26,557
It's the safest way to confirm
what's wrong with him.

621
00:39:26,682 --> 00:39:28,928
I need him to breathe out
as I pull on the tube.

622
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:30,255
Breathe out.

623
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:44,284
Say, "ah."

624
00:39:55,787 --> 00:39:56,643
I'm sorry.

625
00:39:57,453 --> 00:39:58,653
We were wrong.

626
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:02,899
I need to suction out your throat

627
00:40:03,307 --> 00:40:04,857
before we reintubate.

628
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:13,869
- Your son smoke?
- Smoke?

629
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:16,705
- I don't think so.
- Tobacco stains on his teeth.

630
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:24,722
He says he used to chew tobacco
to cut weight for wrestling.

631
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:25,839
Used to?

632
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,050
Chewing tobacco wouldn't explain
his symptoms.

633
00:40:28,775 --> 00:40:30,634
But not chewing tobacco might.

634
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,495
Taub was right.
It's sarcoidosis.

635
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,017
The tobacco releases toxins.

636
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:38,966
Those toxins suppressed
his immune system.

637
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:40,886
Once he quit chewing,

638
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,566
the absence of those toxins kicked
a dormant condition into hyper-drive.

639
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:48,960
Is it treatable?

640
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,041
Usually responds to corticosteroids
and methotrexate.

641
00:40:54,463 --> 00:40:55,841
I'll start the meds.

642
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,240
I need sleeping pills.

643
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,892
I was gonna hit up Wilson,
but he's not answering his phone.

644
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:09,730
He must have left it in his pants.

645
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:13,609
Which he wasn't wearing when the police
found him trying to walk home...

646
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:15,600
oddly, from his own apartment.

647
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,476
Pills.

648
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:24,684
Your patient's doing fine.

649
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:26,441
Thanks to your team.

650
00:41:29,312 --> 00:41:31,488
It wasn't eosinophilic
pneumonitis, was it?

651
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,423
Sarcoidosis.

652
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:35,283
Good.

653
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,704
House, please talk to me.

654
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,562
I haven't slept through the night
since Kutner killed himself.

655
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,366
The wrestling might have to wait.

656
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:17,325
I'm gonna tell your doctors
to repair your implant.

657
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,480
{\You always said
that was my decision.}

658
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:23,161
And then you ripped it out

659
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:25,584
rather than live with it
for a few days, even.

660
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:28,959
I'm your mother.

661
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:30,793
This is my call.

662
00:42:31,408 --> 00:42:33,592
I don't know
if I'm making the right one.

663
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:36,208
But it's mine to make.

664
00:43:17,504 --> 00:43:18,386
Sleep well?

665
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,358
