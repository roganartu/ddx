[All whoop in joy]

4
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,447
Do you feel the spirit?

5
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:33,553
All:
Yeah! Halleluiah!

6
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:39,853
And in the 39th year of his reign,

7
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,952
Asa was diseased in his feet,

8
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:44,008
until the disease was exceedingly great.

9
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,183
Yet...

10
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:47,131
he didn't seek help from the Lord,

11
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,656
but from the physicians.

12
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:53,427
Now, there is nothing wrong
with seeing a doctor.

13
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,526
But can a doctor heal through the power
that Jesus gave his disciples?

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,372
Men of science can walk
through life with blindfolds

15
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:05,114
never knowing that you or I
could not take a single step
if we were not uplifted by God.

16
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:12,399
Agnes,

17
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:16,765
thank you for letting me
an instrument of God's love for you.

18
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:36,370
In faith...

19
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:37,207
Oh...

20
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:39,419
all things are possible.

21
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,549
My friends,

22
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,821
I want you to let Agnes
feel the wave of faith
in this church here today

23
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:50,619
lifting her into God's hands.

24
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:52,525
[All cheer]

25
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:57,805
You can do it.
Come on, sister.

"Oh Happy Day"

27
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,666

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,266
Thank you, God!

30
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,012
Thank you, Lord!
Thanks be to God!

31
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:15,808
Thank you, Lo--

32
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:28,621
Oof!

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,319
Oof, oof!

34
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:33,500
No!

35
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:38,731
Son!

36
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:43,899
Dad, I think I need a doctor.

37
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,789
Agh!

38
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,336
2X19 - House vs God

Original Airdate (FOX): 25 APR-2006

40
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:26,791
Did you remember my DVD player?

41
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,210
Well, if you wanted it,
you shouldn't have left it behind
when you moved out.

42
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:33,619
Now I get it.
It's a drag watching porn on VHS.

43
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,508
I'll call you
as soon as I'm done with it.

44
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,318
That's if you ever
get a phone installed.

45
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:39,683
Oh, forget it.

46
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,010
I'll come by and get it myself.

47
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,110
After work? Thursday?

48
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,105
Won't be home Thursday.

49
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:48,297
No problem, I still have a key.
I can let myself in and out.

50
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,333
I guess maybe I could
bring it in tomorrow.

51
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,043
After all, how many times
can you hit pause

52
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:55,893
at the part where Lindsay Lohan
wins the spelling bee?

53
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:57,628
What is it about
girls who can spell?

54
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,803
It's math contest.

55
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:00,947
What is it about girls
who can count?

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,289
It's poker night, isn't it?

57
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,363
[Elevator dings]

58
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,549
You said weeks ago
that I could play.

59
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,272
- Stop making excuses.
- Gotta go.

60
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,629
Building full of sick people.

61
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,770
If I hurry,
maybe I can avoid them.

62
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:14,649
The abdominal series showed
no evidence of obstruction.

63
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:15,663
What'd you have to eat?

64
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:19,953
Chicken sandwich.
We travel. Lots of fast food.

65
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,491
Thank you.
I barely felt it.

66
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,367
You're welcome.

67
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:29,580
God told me you were kind.

68
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,144
You talk to God?

69
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,622
God's presence often descends on Boyd
to help him guide others.

70
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:38,117
This been going on long?

71
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:39,670
Since he was ten.

72
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:44,275
God told me
I would meet a woman healer...

73
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:48,912
who was harboring vengeful thoughts
about a man she works with.

74
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:52,661
That's God's job.

75
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:56,379
I'll keep that in mind.

76
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:00,524
- His urine is dilute.
- What does that mean?

77
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:03,216
It could mean that for some reason
his kidneys aren't purifying
the way they should,

78
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:06,263
which would let toxins
accumulate in his body.

79
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,977
We'll run the blood work
and see what it tells us.

80
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,644
Thank you, I appreciate it.

81
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,760
God talks to him?

82
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,409
It's not psychosis,
he's just religious.

83
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:23,586
The only medical issue that
showed up on the blood work
is low sodium.

84
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,025
No, you talk to God, you're religious.
God talks to you, you're psychotic.

85
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:31,039
A lot of people experience their religion
as something more than symbolic.

86
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:34,059
- That doesn't mean--
- God ever talk to you when
you where in the seminary?

87
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:37,910
No.

88
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:40,169
God's loss, our gain.

89
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:42,314
He's either psychotic
or a scam artist.

90
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,114
He was actually
really impressive.

91
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:48,110
Well, yeah...
with the burning bush and all,
it's quite the show.

92
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,193
He was intelligent, polite, dignified.
He's not a typical 15-year-old.

93
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:55,841
And he told Cameron God wants her to stop being pissed at me over the article.

94
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,013
God  knows you stole
Cameron's article?

95
00:05:58,113 --> 00:06:00,863
He knows she's
"harboring vengeful thoughts."

96
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,349
I'm over it.

97
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:06,102
Yeah, I can tell that from
the Berlin Wall of body language
between you.

98
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:08,665
I'm shocked
that he picked up on it.
Low sodium.

99
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:10,308
Check for Addison's?

100
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:13,080
No pigmentation and
potassium levels were normal.

101
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,078
Cirrhosis?

102
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:16,851
Liver feels fine.
Transaminases are normal.

103
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:20,750
[ Sighs]
We should monitor his saline intake
to correct the low sodium.

104
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,965
No more than one MEQ
per liter per hour.

105
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,086
And let's push the patient history.
See if there's any evidence
of drugs or other delusions.

106
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:28,444
I'll take care of it.

107
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:32,854
You're gonna talk to a patient?

108
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:34,843
God talks to him.

109
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,083
It'd be arrogant of me
to assume that I'm better than God.

110
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:47,318
So, you're a "faith healer."

111
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,263
Or is that a pejorative?

112
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:53,437
Do you prefer something like
"Divine health management"?

113
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:57,330
I though God might have
mentioned that I was coming.

114
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:00,609
I'm okay with"faith healer", Dr. House.

115
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:04,187
Oh! That's a nice one.

116
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,140
You  didn't even go with...

117
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:08,547
"I see an H and a medical coat."

118
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:10,274
The nurses talk about you a lot.

119
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:13,473
Ah, don't believe them.
I keep a sock in my pants.

120
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,739
Faith, that's another word
for ignorance, isn't it?

121
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,770
I never understood how people
could be so proud of believing in
something with no proof at all.

122
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:21,898
Like that's an achievement.

123
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:23,793
God's asking for our trust.

124
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,711
You can't love somebody
and not trust them.

125
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:27,445
Trust has to be earned.

126
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:30,360
You can't trust someone
hiding in a closet.

127
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,764
You don't trust anyone.

128
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,796
You seem lucid.

129
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:39,014
There's no confusion,
no lethargy.

130
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,778
What drugs
have you been taking?

131
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:43,712
Nothing.
Uh, some aspirin. I...

132
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:47,236
get focused on something,
I forget to eat-- Next thing you know,
I've got a hunger headache.

133
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:50,091
So aspirin and hospitals are okay.

134
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,247
That's an interesting attitude for
someone who's kept any number of people
from getting medical help.

135
00:07:55,331 --> 00:08:01,146
Just because
I believe in prayer doesn't mean
I don't believe in germs and toxins.

136
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,916
That bottle's been opened before.

137
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:08,255
You refilled it
at the water cooler.

138
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:09,826
Yes.

139
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:10,991
How often do you do that?

140
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,903
A few times an hour.
He likes to stay hydrated.

141
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:17,336
You think germs
might have gotten in?

142
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,346
I think water
might have gotten in.

143
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:29,192
We can adjust your pain meds.

144
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,726
Again?

145
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:34,967
Suppose we increase
your Oxycodone.

146
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,526
We both know the only reason
I'm talking lucidly now

147
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:43,220
is because I did not take
my full dose this morning.

148
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,615
You've done your best.

149
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:51,256
And I have been
a good soldier.

150
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:55,744
It's time
we accept it's over.

151
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:00,281
What about the trip
you were talking about taking?

152
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,904
You've wanted to see Florence
since you were a teenager, right?

153
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:04,897
Yeah, go now.
All drugged up.

154
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:09,183
It's not exactly the trip
I've been dreaming of.

155
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,727
Okay, but you're strong.

156
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,741
You're dealing with this.

157
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:21,748
And there is the right combination of
pain meds out there. And we'll find it.

158
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:23,922
Don't give up on us.

159
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,169
And don't be startled by
the sound you're about to hear.

160
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,596
[Bangs at a door]
Excuse me.

161
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:35,368
I have a friend
with boundary issues.

162
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:42,337
[Crow caws]

163
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:44,773
Can this wait five minutes?

164
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:46,734
Is she dying?

165
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,630
Yeah.

166
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:51,158
Before the end of this consult?

167
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:54,155
They could build monuments
to your self-centeredness.

168
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:59,245
Patient. 15-year-old.
Faith healer. Hotline to God.

169
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,789
- What are his symptoms?
- He is not a saint.

170
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,671
He figures out what's going on
in people's lives by watching,
listening, deducing.

171
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:08,878
And you're worried about
trademark infringement?

172
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:13,792
Then he passes on advice from God
so he can watch them jump.
It's a power trip.

173
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:17,122
Ah, and there the similarities end.
Why is he here?

174
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,115
I fear for the human race.

175
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:23,737
A teenager claims to be the voice of God and
people with advanced degrees are listening.

176
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:27,391
The majority of Americans
believe in a personal God.
What are his symptoms?

177
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:29,225
Massive cramps, low sodium.

178
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:33,142
Turns out he's been
drinking water non-stop.
God told him to purify his body.

179
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:35,058
Huge water intake
would cause low sodium.

180
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:37,000
Which would cause
the cramping. Yeah, I got it.

181
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,428
What, that's it?
You solved it.

182
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:43,778
You just brought me out here
to rant because faith annoys you?

183
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:46,822
Mm-hmm. He's all better.

184
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:52,216
You know, I'd get it
if people were just looking
for a way to fill the holes.

185
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,357
But they want the holes.
They wanna live in the holes.

186
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,539
And they go nuts when
someone else pours dirt in their holes.

187
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:03,912
Climb out of your holes, people!

188
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:25,720
# Go tell it on the mountain #

189
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:30,226
# Over the hills and everywhere #

190
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,018
# Go tell it on the mountain #

191
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,914
# That Jesus Christ is born #

192
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:41,684
# Go tell it on the mountain #

193
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:45,703
# Over the hills and everywhere #

194
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,975
# Go tell it on the mountain #

195
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:52,155
# That Jesus Christ is born #

196
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,208
Boyd, are you all right?

197
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:55,611
# Go tell it on the mountain #

198
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:56,619
Boyd.

199
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:58,835
# Over the hills and... #

200
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,476
Come on.

201
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:08,719
Let's go.
Can you tell meyour name?

202
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:11,140
Do you know where you are?

203
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,810
Boyd?

204
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:16,763
Boyd?

205
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,426
God doesn't want you to be afraid.

206
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:25,028
He sent me here to heal you.

207
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:28,408
You think he hasn't heard you prayers,
but he heard them all.
Even the ones you didn't say.

208
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:30,871
Sorry. Boyd, come on.
Let's get you back to your room.

209
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,235
In faith,
all things are possible.

210
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:35,141
Let's go.

211
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,799
Lord...

212
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:39,684
I call on you to relieve
the suffering of your daughter.

213
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:41,655
- Grace?
- And make her whole again.

214
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,682
Hey, hey!
What are you doing? What is this?

215
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,669
He's just had
a complex partial seizure.

216
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:48,424
His disoriented.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

217
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:51,218
Well get him back
to his room--now.

218
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,675
You okay?

219
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:04,008
Are we certain
he even had a seizure?

220
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:07,543
Hymn singing and healing.
He does it all the time, doesn't he?

221
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:08,872
Isn't it interesting

222
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:12,864
that religious behavior is
so close to being crazy,
we can't tell 'em apart.

223
00:13:12,944 --> 00:13:15,740
The repetition,
the lack of affect and awareness.

224
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,854
- It was a seizure.
- Infection?

225
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:18,944
No fever.

226
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:20,286
Could be Wilson's.

227
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,638
Or maybe it's
a glycogen storage disease.

228
00:13:22,722 --> 00:13:25,506
- Or a brain tumor.
- Or tuberous sclerosis.

229
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:27,661
Hmm.

230
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,596
How to settle this?

231
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:33,877
We could ask our patient to ask God.
Or we could MRI his brain.

232
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,916
Which way do you wanna go?

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,687
- 'Cause I'm open to all possibilities.
- House!

234
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,848
Why the hell do you
let an unstable patient
wander the hallways?

235
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:41,801
His leash broke.

236
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:45,082
The last thing a terminal patient needs is
to hear somebody taunt them with a cure.

237
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,839
She was freaked,
she was angry.

238
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:51,479
And now she's
not freaked and angry.
And you are.

239
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,468
She says
she's "feeling better".

240
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:58,586
Maybe not singing and dancing, but
she's feeling just a little bit happy
for the first time in months.

241
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:01,398
Sudden drop in pain
can create euphoria.

242
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:03,061
You shouldn't let her
have her vacation?

243
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:04,492
Oh, that's great.

244
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:08,228
And when the vacation's over,
when she crash lands from all this denial?

245
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,732
She was dealing with her illness.

246
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:12,645
Now her expectations are rising.

247
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:16,678
And you're not the one who
has to be there when all that false hope
gets yanked out from under her.

248
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:24,900
Don't you guys
have anything to do?

249
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:29,135
How long have you
been healing people?

250
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,373
You believe
that's what I'm doing?

251
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,264
I'd like to.

252
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,079
But you don't.

253
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:39,988
Why do you always do things
you don't wanna do?

254
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,933
It's okay,
I don't expect a real answer.

255
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:05,116
God would probably want you
to take that stick out of your butt
and get over this.

256
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:07,628
If there is some higher order
running the universe,

257
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:10,121
it's probably so different from
anything our species can conceive,

258
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:12,459
there's no point
in even thinking about it.

259
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:15,356
But I doubt it gives a damn
about my butt.

260
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,755
So you believe God might exist,
but you don't think about it?

261
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:19,809
It's the most important issue--

262
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:22,735
I think penguins might as well
speculate about nuclear physics.

263
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:24,118
Why are we having
this conversation?

264
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:26,611
What? I'm curious.

265
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:32,886
You cannot tell someone they are
your colleague and not a friend and
then casually chat about the afterlife.

266
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,474
You actually keep score?

267
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,966
Your MRI results aren't done yet.

268
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:02,729
Go back to your room.
No singing.

269
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:06,730
Well, you would get a point
for figuring why the low sodium.

270
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:08,684
What are my guy's points for?

271
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:13,986
Your trick about the spat between
Dr. Cameron and Dr. Foreman
apparently impressed someone.

272
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:15,657
And the second point?

273
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,008
Do you think it could be
because I healed Grace?

274
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:26,399
She's  been back
to see me. I like her.

275
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,082
You like messing with people.

276
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:30,348
That's why you're here now.

277
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:33,787
Maybe you think that
your batteries are powered by God,
maybe you don't.

278
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:36,314
Either way,
you enjoy what you do.

279
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:37,497
Yes.

280
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:39,280
I like helping people.

281
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:43,028
I get a rush when
I see the look on their faces when
they realize their burdens are gone.

282
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,079
Mm, but you make sure
you're in the next state

283
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:48,805
by the time the endorphins wear off
and the arthritis comes back.

284
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:51,015
That doesn't happen.

285
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:54,351
Oh, you do extensive follow-up studies?

286
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:55,989
God told me.

287
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,680
See, that's not fair.
We were having fun.

288
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:05,262
It's hard to keep sniping rationally
when you throw a bomb like that in there.

289
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:13,054
He spoke with me about you too.

290
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:15,043
Forgive my enemies?

291
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:18,238
Never date a Taurus
when Mercury's in retrograde?

292
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,119
Yeah, I learned that one myself--
the hard way.

293
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:23,915
God says you look for
excuses to be alone.

294
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,716
See, that is exactly the kind of
brilliance that sounds deep,

295
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:32,154
but you could say it about any person
who doesn't pine for the social
approval of everyone he meets.

296
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:36,352
Which you were cleverly able to
deduce about me but not being a moron.

297
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,668
Next  time tell God
to be more specific.

298
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:43,620
God wants you to invite
Dr. Wilson to your poker game.

299
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,801
Don't talk to my patient.

300
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:02,875
What are you talking about?

301
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:06,235
You get all huffy when my patient
stumbles into yours in the hallway.

302
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,845
But you got no qualms
about chatting my guy up.

303
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,271
This is fun,
it's like "Password".

304
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:14,044
Keep talking, I'll jump in
when I get a clue what the hell
you're talking about.

305
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:16,907
God knows about
my poker game.

306
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:18,401
You think I told him?

307
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,031
Either that or I start
going to church every Sunday.

308
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:22,531
That would mess
with my bowling league.

309
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:27,793
House, aside from yelling at him
to get back to his room,
I've never spoken to your patient.

310
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:35,500
MRI shows an abnormal area.

311
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,479
Tuberous sclerosis.

312
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:39,772
It's the right neighborhood.

313
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:40,984
Accounts for all the symptoms.

314
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:42,181
All of them.

315
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:45,334
Leading cortical tuber's
identifiable.

316
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,374
We can do this surgically.

317
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,387
Tell our patient congratulations.

318
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:52,760
Soon these chats with God
will be a thing of the past.

319
00:18:53,737 --> 00:18:55,880
Tie goes to the mortal.

320
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:13,715
Did you know the Catholic Church
keeps a doctor at Lourdes?

321
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,652
He hears
the same thing every day.

322
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,909
But out of the thousands of cases of
people who have claimed to feel better,

323
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,999
the Catholic Church has only
recognized a handful as miracles.

324
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:27,556
But they do recognize a handful.

325
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,901
Well, they're a church.

326
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:32,650
It's  what they do.

327
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:40,215
Look, for the past couple of years,
the world's been getting smaller.

328
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:42,855
Eight months, six months.

329
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:46,852
I watch a trailer for a movie...

330
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:50,806
and I think, am I gonna be here
when that comes out?

331
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:55,718
But maybe there is still
a horizon out there.

332
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,219
You know, maybe...

333
00:19:57,355 --> 00:20:01,061
Maybe I can make plans
for a year from now.

334
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:03,049
Two years.

335
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:07,297
I like the view.

336
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:14,080
The view is a lie.
And if you believe it,
you're going to crash so hard...

337
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,403
Let me take
new images of your liver.

338
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,557
You can't accept
that it could be true.

339
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:24,424
Well, if it is true,
you shouldn't be afraid of proving it.

340
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:31,833
Tuberous Sclerosis
is a genetic disorder.

341
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:35,144
It causes small, benign tumors
to grow in various parts of the body.

342
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:36,753
In this case, the brain.

343
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:38,398
You said benign.

344
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:42,299
They probably are.
But benign or not,
they're not in a good location.

345
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:43,787
We need to remove them.

346
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:45,327
You're talking brain surgery?

347
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:48,262
His symptoms are getting worse
which means the tumors are growing.

348
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:53,550
Surgery will correct it all.
The chemical imbalance, the seizures,
the auditory hallucinations.

349
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:55,312
Hallucinations?

350
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:58,856
Without the surgery,
it's just gonna get worse.

351
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:00,824
It might even be fatal.

352
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:05,600
With the surgery, your son should be
a perfectly normal 15-year-old boy.

353
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,656
I'm not normal.

354
00:21:17,636 --> 00:21:19,621
I need you to talk to my patient.

355
00:21:19,705 --> 00:21:21,192
I'll get this one.

356
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:25,096
Why do I have the feeling
you're plotting world domination?

357
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,542
Moses is refusing surgery.

358
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:28,762
You have a gift.

359
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:31,885
People thank you for
telling them they're gonna die.

360
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:37,026
If I can get him to agree to surgery,
I want in on the poker game.

361
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,741
You would let this kid die
just to get into a stupid game?

362
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:43,155
You'd let him die
just to keep me out?

363
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,598
Hi.

364
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,854
I'm Dr. Wilson.

365
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,683
I knew
they'd send somebody else.

366
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,689

368
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:06,464
Can I ask why you don't
want the tumors removed?

369
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:08,205
God put them there
for a reason.

370
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,544
You think God needs a telephone
in your head to talk to you?

371
00:22:11,628 --> 00:22:14,110
Isn't he everywhere?
It's not a long distance call, is it?

372
00:22:14,194 --> 00:22:15,609
This is the way
God does things.

373
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:20,041
Through natural law.
If he went around doing
big, flashy miracles all the time,

374
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,517
- nobody would need faith.
- How come everyone else needs faith,

375
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:26,015
but you just get the guy
screaming his existence in your ear?

376
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:29,854
Your turn.

377
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,556
Do you think
God wants you to die?

378
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:40,275
This is the way that the Lord
often is with his chosen ones.

379
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,622
He gives the most trials
to those that he loves the most.

380
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:47,001
How sweet.
You abdicate your authority.

381
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:51,824
Avoid those tricky parental issues
like whether to let him drive at 16.
Just let him die at 15.

382
00:22:51,965 --> 00:23:00,252
So you believe
your son is... um, a saint.

383
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:02,562
The way I understand it,

384
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,556
one of the hallmarks
of a saint is humility.

385
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:09,878
Someone with true humility would
consider the possibility that...

386
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:12,738
God hadn't chosen him
for that kind of honor.

387
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,711
He'd consider
the possibility that...

388
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:19,967
he just had an illness.

389
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:28,799
You have a gift
for manipulation.

390
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:31,523
I listen. I have an actual
conversation with people.

391
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:34,126
Which, shockingly, does raise
the odds they'll be cooperative.

392
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,274
That's what I'm saying.

393
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:38,746
You read that kid, and
you manipulated the hell out of him.

medical proof that his delusions are true.

we need another 24 hours
to normalize his sodium level.

He's already normalized.

Actually, tell Joseph.
Jesus'll know you're lying.

to go over every line of every file on that woman.

Isn't he the one
we're supposed to save?

424

The only way to save him is
to prove that she is still dying.

which machine they used.

00:31:50,495 --> 00:31:54,736
Most people in your situation
just have their careers to worry about.

514
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:57,120
You've got that
and divine retribution.

515
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:57,925
Tell them.

516
00:31:57,991 --> 00:32:00,929
Tell me how it happened,
and I'll tell them whatever you want.

517
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:05,986
She'd had a bad day.
Pain-wise.

518
00:32:07,212 --> 00:32:09,314
Her ride didn't show up
to take her home.

519
00:32:09,382 --> 00:32:10,791
So you offered.

520
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:11,793
Yeah.

521
00:32:12,652 --> 00:32:14,624
She didn't have any groceries.

522
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,417
She was too sick to go out. I...

523
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:20,180
figured I could afford
to take a half hour.

524
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:24,948
- Pick her up and few things.
- And stay and make sure she's okay.

525
00:32:25,032 --> 00:32:25,985
Yeah.

526
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:28,150
And never leave.

527
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:31,733
You told me
you got an apartment.

528
00:32:32,277 --> 00:32:33,778
But you moved in with her.

529
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:35,618
You lied to me.

530
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:36,979
Tell them.

531
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:42,340
His name is not Wilson, and
he's screwed up worse than I am.

532
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:45,520
Okay, yes, I lied to you.
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:45,604 --> 00:32:50,501
Half the doctors who specialize in oncology
turn into burnt out cases. But you,

534
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:52,366
you eat neediness.

535
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:54,031
Lucky for you.

536
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:58,245
Thanks for the game, guys.
I don't think I'll be coming back.

537
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:02,710
You're a functional vampire.
Sure, you're heroic, useful to society.

538
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:04,868
But only because it feeds you.

539
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:10,009
There's nothing worth stealing,
so don't even look.

540
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:20,513
You don't just have a fetish
for needy people, you marry them!

541
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:21,782
- Here we go!
- You mean it!

542
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:25,536
And then time passes, suddenly
they're not so needy anymore.

543
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:27,218
Your fault.

544
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:28,895
You've been there
for them too much.

545
00:33:28,979 --> 00:33:32,501
They're getting
healthy, independent.
And that's just ugly.

546
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:36,129
God, you must be
pissed at God right now.
Making her all happy.

547
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,141
Why are you doing this?

548
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:38,844
Because you're being stupid.

549
00:33:38,948 --> 00:33:39,835
[Laughs]

550
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,308
You know what you're risking
by sleeping with a patient.

551
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:46,285
Oh, that's crap. You're not mad
because I'm risking my job.

552
00:33:46,515 --> 00:33:48,153
You're not even mad
because I lied to you.

553
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,434
You're mad because I lied to you,
and you couldn't tell.

554
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:52,161
Yeah, you got me nailed.

555
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,452
Yeah, that's why you didn't
want me in your poker game.

556
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,364
Because when it comes
to being in control,

557
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,068
Gregory House leaves
our faith healer kid in the dust.

558
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,782
And that's why
religious belief annoys you.

559
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,004
Because if the universe
operates by abstract rules,

560
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:07,289
you can learn them,
you can protect yourself.

561
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:10,747
If a supreme being exists,
he can squash you any time he wants.

562
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:12,917
He knows where I am.

563
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,378
[Phone rings]

564
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:16,660
I think it's yours.

565
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:18,975
Yeah.

566
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:23,402
I'll be right there.

567
00:34:25,781 --> 00:34:28,574
Jesus is spiking a fever.
He's delusional.

568
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,583
Tuberous sclerosis
doesn't cause fever.

569
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:31,612
I know.

570
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,779
I'll drive.

571
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:42,999
Pick any random guy off the street.
Bring him in here,

572
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:47,122
examine him exhaustively.
You will find at least
three things wrong with him.

573
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:49,560
This kid has
tuberous sclerosis.

574
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:52,172
- A mild case.
- But his tumors are growing.

575
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:54,431
We assumed that
the tumors were growing.

576
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:57,057
'Cause he's getting sicker.
But he could have grown old and died

577
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:58,945
and never known about them
if he hadn't come here.

578
00:34:59,012 --> 00:35:02,258
We were looking for
something that was more or less
in the right part of the brain.

579
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:05,972
It's like we found someone
standing over a dead body holding a gun.

580
00:35:06,056 --> 00:35:09,392
We arrested them,
didn't look any further.
Well, sometimes

581
00:35:09,584 --> 00:35:12,286
people really do just stumble
into a murder scene.

582
00:35:12,345 --> 00:35:14,622
His fever is 103 and rising.

583
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:18,174
If we don't do anything,
he's gonna be chatting with God
face to face real soon.

584
00:35:18,238 --> 00:35:21,446
Fevers don't come from
a long-term underlying condition.

585
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,202
He's a garden variety religious nut
who happens to have an infection.

586
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:28,723
It's lumbar puncture time.

587
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:31,994
No.

588
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:35,049
No, God told me
no more of man's medicine.

589
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:37,136
If we have faith in him,
he'll make me well.

590
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,249
It's just a test.

591
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:40,013
We just wanna
find out what's wrong.

592
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,791
God knows what's wrong.
God will take care of it.

593
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:47,228
He's delirious, and he's a minor.
This is your decision, and not his.

594
00:35:47,294 --> 00:35:51,770
The kingdom of heaven is
like a treasure hidden in field
which when a man finds, he hides.

595
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:55,058
And for joy he goes and sells
all he owns and buys that field.

596
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:57,575
Buy all the land you want!
Don't blow your brains out.

597
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:00,478
You're watching your son kill himself!
He's out of his mind with fever--

598
00:36:00,562 --> 00:36:05,518
Dad, if your faith is weak,
I will fail.

599
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:08,675
I need you.

600
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:15,307
I'm sorry.

601
00:36:16,438 --> 00:36:18,665
You don't even know
what's wrong with him.

602
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:22,068
God knows the answer.

603
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:25,521
And I would rather leave it
in His hands than yours.

604
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:35,391
Wilson.

605
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,769
I need you to do your thing.

606
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,630
You do know that I don't
actually have magical powers.

607
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:43,001
I have faith.

608
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:45,487
You're better off trying to slip
some antibiotics into a meal...

609
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:48,206
Which antibiotics?
We don't know what infection he's got.

610
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:50,065
- Go as broad as you can.
- Forget it.

611
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:52,480
Our best hope
is your silver tongue.

612
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,395
What if it's not an infection?

613
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:57,312
Where you not paying attention when
I was doing my murder scene metaphor?

614
00:36:57,396 --> 00:36:59,341
What if the tuberous sclerosisis guilty?

615
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,255
It had the gun in its hand,
it was standing over...

616
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:02,534
Doesn't cause fever.

617
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:03,778
It causes everything else.

618
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:06,055
What if the fever's
the innocent bystander?

619
00:37:06,122 --> 00:37:08,984
Fever could have been set off
by something he picked up anywhere.

620
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:11,296
Could have been
a bug he got here.

621
00:37:15,741 --> 00:37:18,297
Or a bug he gave here.

622
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:23,723
He gave it to your patient.

623
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,426
That's why her tumor shrank.
The virus went after the cancer first.

624
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,801
Are you saying
a virus attacked her tumor?

625
00:37:30,143 --> 00:37:35,290
For 200 years,
there have been reports of
wild viruses that target tumors.

626
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:38,928
Early 1900s,
an Italian medical journal wrote up
a woman with cervical cancer

627
00:37:39,012 --> 00:37:40,759
who was injected
with a weak strain of rabies.

628
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,281
I have no idea why they did that,
but her tumor shrank.

629
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:45,233
You think
he gave her rabies?

630
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:49,944
One of the virus types
most prone to go after cancer cells
is herpes.

631
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:51,913
Herpes encephalitis.

632
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:54,502
It would fit.

633
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:57,760
Seizure, low sodium.
Even the blurred vision.

634
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:02,861
And it would mean if you're right,
Grace's cancer is coming back.

635
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:06,395
You're not gonna
be able to convince them.

636
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:08,305
They don't want any more tests.
They don't wanna...

637
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,710
They can't argue
with the mark of Cain.

638
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:14,520
I'm not gonna
change my mind.

639
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:16,994
No more tests.
God knows the way.

640
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:19,641
Okay, let's start with his shirt.

641
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,592
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

642
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,367
I'm on a mission from God.

643
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:27,000
If you won't let me
undress you, then strip.

644
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:28,548
What's he doing?
What's going on?

645
00:38:28,632 --> 00:38:30,930
That woman you helped,
you gave her a virus.

646
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:33,008
No, she's healed.
I have a gift--

647
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:35,757
A gift is jewelry, socks.

648
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,598
What you have
is herpes encephalitis.

649
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:43,099
The only way you could have transmitted it
is by scratching one of your own sores
and touching another person.

650
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:45,623
Herpes, that's something
you get from sex, right?

651
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:49,169
Either that or cold sores.
Your kid got it from the sex.

652
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:52,116
No, no sores.
No, my body is clean.

653
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,816
They examined me
when I came in. No sores.

654
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,086
Herpes hides.

655
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:58,915
You have an outbreak, it goes away,
comes back, goes away. Strip!

656
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:01,234
You didn't have a sore
when you came in,
but you've got one now.

657
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:03,415
Dad, I've never ever--

658
00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:07,514
You ever wonder why a perfect child
of God should feel so desperate

659
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:11,859
to purify his body that
he needed to scarf  down
a dozen gallons of water a day?

660
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:15,586
- Boyd, is he right?
- Dad, no, he's crazy.

661
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:18,192
Help me.
Dr. Wilson, help!

662
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:20,946
God said no medicine,
no procedures.

663
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:23,891
Taking off your clothes
doesn't count as either of those.

664
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:25,505
This one's your call.

665
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:30,842
Son...

666
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:33,790
Dad, you have to
have faith in me.

667
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:37,563
I have faith in the Lord.
You, I trust.

668
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:40,884
As much as you can
trust a teenage boy.

669
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:44,371
Take off your clothes.

670
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:57,729
Relax.

671
00:39:57,827 --> 00:40:00,635
A few Hail Marys,
a little acyclovir.

672
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,408
You'll be picking up angels
again in no time.

673
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:22,867
Come in.

674
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:33,445
My father told me
I have to apologize to you.

675
00:40:34,877 --> 00:40:36,904
Still hearing voices?

676
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:41,340
You're lucky.

677
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:45,787
You go through life with a certainty
that what you're doing is right.

678
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:49,936
I know
how comforting that is.

679
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,806
Good luck.

680
00:41:12,065 --> 00:41:14,896
You're not gonna
give me my final point?

681
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:16,974
You knew it was me?

682
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:18,954
Who else?

683
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:32,625
You don't think God
should get a point knocked off?

684
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:35,155
- The tumor shrank.
- Because of a virus.

685
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:38,296
Do you know what the odds are?
She had to have the right type of cancer.

686
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:41,864
He had to have the right type of virus.
The exposure had to be--

687
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:44,306
- She won the lottery.
- You say won the lottery,

688
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:46,805
- he says... miracle.
- Yeah,

689
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:51,860
the hand of God reached into this kid's pants,
made him have sex so he could scratch a rash,

690
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,599
stick his fingers
in some woman's face,
give her a few extra months.

691
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,823
Come on, he's just another
liar and manipulator.

692
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:01,099
Well, nobody's
as perfectas you are.

693
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:07,622
It is possible to believe in something
and still fail to live up to it.

694
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:25,504
So, how's your girlfriend?

695
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:29,440
She got a little extra time
out of this. Not a lot.

696
00:42:29,524 --> 00:42:31,393
She didn't crash?

697
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:36,238
No... She says she's happier
when she believes in
something bigger than she is.

698
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:38,080
She still believes.

699
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:41,135
Faith.
She's going to Florence.

700
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,045
You moving out?

701
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:44,752
Yeah.

702
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:47,151
Moving back in with me?

703
00:42:49,342 --> 00:42:51,907
I don't think
that's a great idea.

704
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:55,946
But we're okay.

705
00:42:57,005 --> 00:42:59,555
House, you are...

706
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:04,673
as God made you.
