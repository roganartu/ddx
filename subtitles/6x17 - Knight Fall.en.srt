1
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:28,132
My lords, and ladies.

2
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:31,916
Today your queen
will choose her champion.

3
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:36,056
Here, he will battle
for not only her honor,

4
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:38,768
but for a title of his own.

5
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:43,104
But only if he can defeat

6
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:45,181
the captain of my guard,

7
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:47,209
sir Horace the black!

8
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:58,537
Sir William...

9
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:01,261
Wouldst thou fight for my honor?

10
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,528
To the death, your majesty.

11
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:07,058
Let's hope it does not come to that.

12
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:12,085
I choose sir William as my champion.

13
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,898
Attack from his left side.

14
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:22,644
I saw his squire
bandaging that shoulder this morning.

15
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,154
I wish thee luck and strength.

16
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:31,606
I fear I shall need all I can get.

17
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:38,869
The captain of my guard,

18
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:42,138
sir Horace the black!

19
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:04,127
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to reconsider your choice, my queen?

20
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,941
I believe I chose rightly, my king.

21
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:17,657
Brave knights,

22
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:20,869
in the honored tradition of our lands,
have at ye!

23
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,849
I fear you chose
most poorly, my love.

24
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,554
What is it?

25
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:15,603
Your eyes.

26
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,757
We need an ambulance
at the Camden fairgrounds.

27
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:41,672
.:: La Fabrique ::.

28
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:43,292
R[H]Ã©sus AB+ Team

29
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:37,849
You're new.

30
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,809
You're naked.

31
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:41,235
And, for the record,

32
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:43,092
a little bit cold.

33
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,312
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that anyone was home.

34
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:48,493
James had an early call,
and I was just leaving.

35
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,594
- Without breakfast?
- I'm fine, thanks.

36
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,372
I'm Sam, by the way.

37
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,542
Nice to meet you.

38
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,961
It'd be nicer if you'd put this on.

39
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:00,343
So you and Wilson...

40
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:03,247
Thought you were staying
in New York last night.

41
00:06:03,636 --> 00:06:05,126
Sorry, must have missed the...

42
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:08,137
"if this trailer be a-rockin'"
sign out front.

43
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,724
I'm really late, so...

44
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:15,977
if there's any chance that we can
pretend this never happened,

45
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:19,149
I'd be completely fine with that.

46
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:30,751
An eight-year-old
with bleeding ears.

47
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:34,105
I'll see that and raise you
a total muscular degeneration.

48
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:36,265
What the hell?

49
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:42,699
I had a dream like this once.
It didn't end well.

50
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:45,658
Huzzah, my loyal peasants!

51
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:47,631
What are you doing?

52
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,246
Filling in for rabbi Shmuhl
at the Goldstein bris.

53
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:54,194
While I'm busy,
you all can check out the knight

54
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,170
down in the E.R.,
who, instead of seizing the throne,

55
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,630
just seized.

56
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:02,759
- He works at a renaissance festival?
- Doesn't work there, he lives there

57
00:07:03,258 --> 00:07:05,321
as part of a wonderful
little troupe,

58
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:07,764
who spend their weekends
reenacting a nobler age,

59
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,884
when people crapped in the streets,
and 13 would have been a grandmother.

60
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,062
Weeks, not weekends. Says here
he's been camping out for a month.

61
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,950
Try doing that with a pen.

62
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:22,761
Why don't you put that down
before you kill one of us?

63
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:26,355
Why don't you give me something
I can use so I won't feel the need to?

64
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,554
Seizure right after a fight
obviously suggests concussion.

65
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:32,565
Obviously it isn't, or the E.R.
wouldn't have called House.

66
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,285
A full set of armor
would protect against visible trauma,

67
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,888
but not transmitted concussive force.
Could be a subdural hematoma.

68
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:41,801
You're forgetting to demonize.

69
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,768
An evil, satanic subdural hematoma.

70
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:47,532
Two demon eyes.

71
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:49,514
Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.

72
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:52,216
Could be an allergic reaction
to something from the renaissance fair.

73
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:55,225
Which is why we need to check out.
Foreman, take Frodo

74
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,955
- and break bread with the hobbits.
- A hematoma is more likely.

75
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,835
That's why you and Chase
are gonna get an MRI.

76
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,661
- But you just...
- I said Frodo, not Gollum.

77
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:07,698
Is he saying I have short legs
or hairy feet?

78
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,826
I don't even know who Frodo is.

79
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:16,265
Who's the chick,
and why are you hiding her?

80
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:18,251
You were home last night?

81
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:19,726
And this morning.

82
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,339
I bumped into your babe, naked.

83
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,315
- I told you to stay out of my bathroom.
- I was in the kitchen.

84
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,322
- She was naked in the kitchen?
- I was naked.

85
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,691
- Why were you naked in the kitchen?
- It's not important.

86
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:32,566
What is, is why you didn't want me
to meet her in the first place.

87
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,941
Is she married?

88
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
A patient?

89
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,146
- I don't have time for this.
- She used to be a man.

90
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,272
She wants to be a man.

91
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,419
It's a man's name,

92
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:43,834
short for...

93
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,570
Samantha.

94
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:54,370
The soulless harpy
you were married to before we met.

95
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:57,747
People change, House.

96
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:02,076
They get older,
ovaries start drying up,

97
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:04,422
and nice guys like you
look attractive again.

98
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,286
I know that,
in your own demented way,

99
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:08,665
you think you're looking out for me.
But I have this.

100
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:11,429
By this, you mean a sinking feeling
in the pit of the stomach.

101
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:13,556
Fine.

102
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:16,684
I get it. It's your life.
You go screw it up. I can wait.

103
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,602
For what?

104
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:20,646
To tell you, "I told you so".

105
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,934
No signs of hematoma.

106
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,770
Brain looks completely normal.

107
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:34,107
Normal, except for the fact
that he likes to play dress-up.

108
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:37,432
My uncle used to pretend
he was king Leopold.

109
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:39,007
<i>I'm not pretending.</i>

110
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:46,544
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

111
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:49,397
<i>You don't really think
you're a knight, do you?</i>

112
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,389
Being a knight isn't a game.

113
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:55,556
<i>It's a lifestyle, we do it every day,
not just when we play dress-up.</i>

114
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,708
<i>We live by a code and uphold ideals</i>

115
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:01,730
<i>like loyalty, courage, humility.</i>

116
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:05,035
And the part where you beat the crap
out of each other in armor?

117
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:07,110
<i>That we do for fun.</i>

118
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:09,757
<i>At least it was up until yesterday.</i>

119
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:12,282
<i>Are we almost done?</i>

120
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,118
<i>'Cause I'm feeling...</i>

121
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,162
Let's get him out of there
before he aspirates.

122
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,326
Anything abnormal on the MRI?

123
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,342
God's teeth,

124
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,067
what strange manner
of garments be these?

125
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,235
We'll be back soon.

126
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:40,142
He consorts with tiny demons
in his hand.

127
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:41,970
'Tis witchcraft, I say!

128
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,911
Do I look like I'm here
to play pretend with you?

129
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,786
Relax, it's not personal.

130
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:52,154
Just tell them you're a time traveler
or something.

131
00:10:52,323 --> 00:10:54,240
If we're gonna be here,
we might enjoy it.

132
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:56,867
Our knight just vomited
inside the MRI.

133
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:59,176
Taub thinks
it might be food poisoning...

134
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:06,073
Which shouldn't be surprising...

135
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:07,812
Outdoor latrines,

136
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,172
food prep going on
next to livestock.

137
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,747
I hear you wish to speak with me,
concerning sir William.

138
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:19,724
- How faireth he?
- Not well,

139
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,267
or we wouldn't be here.

140
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,983
- A pox indeed is...
- Miles.

141
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,423
We just thought it was a concussion.

142
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:28,923
He's gonna be okay, right?

143
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:31,770
We need to look at the area
he was camping out in.

144
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:35,091
And you might want to invest
into a dental plan for the kingdom.

145
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,358
You sure he got sick
from something here?

146
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:41,933
We're not sure
of anything yet, but...

147
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,167
What do you make of this?

148
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,175
Looks like vomit.

149
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,612
Means he was showing symptoms
prior to the fight.

150
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:56,767
True, but I meant this.

151
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:02,054
It's a cow eye.
From the night before the tournament.

152
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,393
He makes the knights
eat all kinds of disgusting stuff.

153
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,616
<i>- Why?
- He got the idea from Fear Factor.</i>

154
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:09,754
Why didn't he mention it?

155
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,306
I make them all take an oath of secrecy
about the ritual.

156
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,613
William tends to take his role
as a knight very seriously.

157
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,280
Do you think
that's what caused him to pass out?

158
00:12:27,443 --> 00:12:28,876
That's not exactly sanitary.

159
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:30,494
Fun stuff never is.

160
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,049
Serious bacterial
food poisoning explains seizure

161
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:37,184
and vomiting.

162
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:40,311
- A lumbar puncture could confirm.
- Except it's not food poisoning.

163
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:43,620
<i>If it was, the E.R. would look like
Camelot right now.</i>

164
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:45,938
All it takes is one bad eyeball.

165
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,163
Or testicle,

166
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:49,730
cow brain, or my personal favorite,

167
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,472
pig rectum, with a side order
of sphincter.

168
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:57,443
- They call that breakfast in Australia.
- No one else was sick,

169
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,782
- 'cause they weren't allergic like him.
- To what?

170
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,186
That's what I sent you
to Middle Earth to find out.

171
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:05,662
Run scratch tests
for the samples you brought back.

172
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:07,594
That's gonna take time,
he's getting worse.

173
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,635
So treat him with epinephrine too.

174
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:19,633
This should prevent
any more symptoms

175
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:22,112
until we can figure out
what it is you're allergic to.

176
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,391
Told you you shouldn't have
eaten all that stuff.

177
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,562
You don't have to stay. You and Miles
are crazy busy, with the wedding.

178
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:32,356
Miles said we could
postpone it until...

179
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:34,775
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
I'll be there.

180
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:39,029
I hope you have a good photographer,
the red-eye filter isn't gonna work.

181
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,948
I need your right arm.

182
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:50,166
That...

183
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:51,376
feels...

184
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:52,966
feels strange.

185
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:57,173
- What is it? What's wrong?
- His heart rate's become irregular.

186
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,759
My chest hurts.
It feels like it's gonna explode.

187
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,595
Tachycardia... We need to shock
him back into rhythm.

188
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,509
I need his gown open.

189
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:10,060
What is that stuff?

190
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:12,646
I don't know.

191
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:23,428
It's not an allergy, or the eppy would
have helped him, not made him worse.

192
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:26,614
Unless he's allergic
and allergic to the cure.

193
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,450
Sodium bisulfite...

194
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:30,615
The preservative
that keeps eppy peppy...

195
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,056
Can cause tachycardia.

196
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:34,309
So can
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,

197
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:36,582
and it also causes
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

198
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,709
And abnormal electrical
pathways in the heart,

199
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,261
- which could cause seizures.
- But not skin infections.

200
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,371
There is an infection that can cause
skin and neurological damage

201
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,497
and spreads rapidly
without treatment.

202
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:49,126
Methicillin resistant
staphylococcus aureus?

203
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:52,807
- Lord have MRSA.
- You weren't wearing gloves

204
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:55,496
when we shocked his heart
back into rhythm.

205
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,606
I'm sure you'll be fine.

206
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:03,359
You two get a sample
to the lab to confirm,

207
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,153
you get the knight into isolation
and on I.V. antibiotics.

208
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,072
You... Stay away from me.

209
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:16,915
Need to talk.

210
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,709
- About the MRSA? I know, we're...
- MRSA, SHMRSA.

211
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,193
Something important.

212
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:24,283
Something you think is more important
than the potentially lethal bacteria

213
00:15:24,408 --> 00:15:26,605
spreading like wildfire
through my hospital?

214
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,910
That narrows it down
to something personal and stupid.

215
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:33,473
Theory confirmed.

216
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,684
He is dating his first wife.
I know.

217
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,509
I don't believe it.

218
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,798
That he didn't ask
your permission first?

219
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:42,858
No, that he's actually capable
of keeping a secret from me.

220
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,403
You'd be surprised how many things
Wilson doesn't tell you.

221
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:48,138
Would I?

222
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,826
Like how you slept
with your father's best friend or...

223
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,519
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You need to break them up.

224
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:57,931
- Forget it.
- So you'd rather sit back and watch

225
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:01,543
while the evil blonde gorges
on Wilson's tender flesh

226
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,518
and then tosses out his bones
like she did the last time?

227
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:06,506
You remember
what he was like after that?

228
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:09,885
Yes, I do.

229
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:11,686
Then do something.

230
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,019
God knows he's not gonna listen to me.
You, on the other hand,

231
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:18,060
have decades of experience
dating and being attracted to losers.

232
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,393
I don't include myself.

233
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:24,000
You know what happens when you interfere
in people's relationships?

234
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,275
Of course.
I do it all the time.

235
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:31,501
- I see your point.
- That is why I'm staying out of this.

236
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,250
You force him to choose,
you might not like the answer.

237
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:47,089
He doesn't seem to be
in as much pain anymore.

238
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,329
Good, but we won't be
out of the woods for sure

239
00:16:49,454 --> 00:16:51,493
until the blisters start to recede.

240
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:54,518
I'm really thirsty.
You mind getting me a soda?

241
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:56,537
Sure, I'll be right back.

242
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:02,396
What's wrong?

243
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,732
The pain in my chest,
it's getting worse.

244
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:07,011
Just now?

245
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:10,702
I didn't want to worry her.

246
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:15,103
So how long have you been
in love with her?

247
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,118
No, we're just friends.

248
00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:18,546
Seriously.

249
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:25,616
- Since the first time I saw her.
- Why don't you tell her?

250
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,713
- She's engaged to my friend.
- The king?

251
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:31,508
Haven't seen him visiting
or sitting by your bedside.

252
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,376
He has responsibilities.

253
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,765
I'm guessing the queen does too.

254
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:39,031
What kind of knight
steals his friend's bride?

255
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:41,601
I hate that I even think about it.

256
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:44,318
You're not a knight.

257
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:45,843
You're just a guy.

258
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:51,050
But I want to be more than that.

259
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:57,723
- Your chest?
- No, my back.

260
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:59,453
Feels like there's a knife in it.

261
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:03,292
Is the infection spreading?

262
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:04,653
It's not MRSA.

263
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,363
It looks like some sort
of clostridial organism.

264
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:11,073
Question is,
which type of clostridium?

265
00:18:11,198 --> 00:18:12,548
There's hundreds.

266
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,260
C. Perfringens?

267
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:18,639
Wouldn't account for his other symptoms.
C. Tetani, on the other hand...

268
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,199
Tetanus, he would have been
inoculated against it.

269
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:23,477
So he cut himself
and didn't get a booster shot.

270
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,015
The guy fights people
with swords for fun.

271
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,669
No one said he's smart.

272
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,526
They don't just fight for fun.
They fight to prove their bravery.

273
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:34,654
You're buying this honor stuff?

274
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:38,165
Fighting's not brave.
It just stupid.

275
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:40,279
You would say that.

276
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,289
- You think I've never been in a fight?
- No, I think you've never won one.

277
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,895
I took on three guys
in college once.

278
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,017
Hope they bought you dinner first.

279
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:50,393
It's not MRSA.

280
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:53,006
- I know, it's poison ivy.
- Poison ivy?

281
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,092
A severe reaction
could cause the blisters

282
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,594
and maybe irritate his eyes enough
to cause the hemorrhaging,

283
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:00,023
but the chest pain and seizures...

284
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:01,681
They have bonfires every night.

285
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:03,975
The burning leaves
aerosolizes the oil.

286
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:05,960
We've seen what it's done
to the outside.

287
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:08,212
Imagine what it's doing
to his lungs and his sinuses.

288
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:10,651
Maybe it remotely fits,
but I'd rather go

289
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,734
with scientific evidence
than with your gut.

290
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:14,526
How about this?

291
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,928
Apparently, it's all over his sword.

292
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:24,788
- It's his heart rate again.
- How fast is it?

293
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,207
- It's slowing, why aren't you...
- It's not MRSA.

294
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:29,001
I'm giving him 12 ccs epinephrine.

295
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,030
He tested positive.
You'll blow his heart out!

296
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:33,486
If it slows any more,
it's gonna stop.

297
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,434
I told you.

298
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,352
And I told you.

299
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:53,618
That wasn't caused by poison ivy.

300
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:54,864
Or epinephrine.

301
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:58,368
The heart problem we ruled out,
we now have to rule back in.

302
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:00,991
We found clostridium bacteria
in the skin samples.

303
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,366
Clostridium's in dirt
and basically harmless.

304
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:06,055
But opportunistic,
if his immune system is depressed.

305
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,556
- Leukemia?
- He would have had symptoms way before.

306
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:12,809
Which is true of anything
that would compromise his immune system,

307
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:16,090
which means it has to be
some other environmental toxin.

308
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,544
Yesterday he was a healthy knight,
today he's sleeping beauty.

309
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:20,843
Nothing else fits.

310
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,070
- Trichinosis from eating infected meat?
- We already ruled out food poisoning.

311
00:20:24,195 --> 00:20:26,997
But the butcher shop and the food stands
at the fair were totally clean.

312
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:29,102
Then he ate the poison apple
somewhere else.

313
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:31,396
Or maybe you just missed it.

314
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:34,774
Start treatment for trichinosis
and confirm with a muscle biopsy.

315
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,304
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

316
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,790
- Sam...
- I told you so.

317
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:54,502
No, she didn't dump me.
She wants to get to know you better.

318
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,753
Damn it.

319
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:58,673
- I shouldn't have let her see me naked.
- It goes against all my instincts,

320
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,300
but I said all right.

321
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:01,712
Why?

322
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:03,881
She thinks I was hiding her
from you.

323
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:06,348
- You were.
- I don't want her to know.

324
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,558
You're asking me
to condone a relationship

325
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:11,519
based on lies and mistrust.

326
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:16,567
- When and where?
- Tonight, Venezia, 8:00.

327
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:20,028
What am I gonna wear?
All my cereal boxes are at the cleaners.

328
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:22,586
House, listen.

329
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:25,741
I know you're worried about me,

330
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,683
and I also know
that that kind of unselfishness

331
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,914
doesn't come naturally to you.

332
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:34,209
But I don't want your help.
I don't need your help.

333
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:36,794
Just come to dinner

334
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:40,173
and be your usual selfish self.

335
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:43,842
How could I say no?

336
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,275
- Miles said he'd stop by later.
- No, tell him not to.

337
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:54,396
I don't want to be seen like this.

338
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,464
You're sick.
That's nothing to be ashamed of...

339
00:21:58,212 --> 00:22:00,912
- Unless you want me to leave.
- No, don't.

340
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:05,115
I think he's saying
it's different with you, Shannon.

341
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,868
It's a guy thing...
They don't like showing weakness.

342
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,337
Right, William?

343
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:12,457
Right.

344
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:14,637
Maybe when I'm feeling
a little better.

345
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,825
I'm gonna take a small sample
of your muscle tissue here.

346
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,050
- Do you mind waiting outside for this?
- Don't hurt him.

347
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,625
He's safe with me.

348
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,846
- I thought you were gonna tell her.
- It's not my call.

349
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:35,646
But if you ask me,
she's waiting for you to.

350
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:39,229
Knights are supposed to be selfless.

351
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:42,945
Right, they conquered countries
and built castles by being selfless.

352
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:46,405
Bravery and loyalty are great qualities
for soldiers.

353
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,828
If you wanna be king,

354
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:50,496
sometimes you have to be willing
to take what's yours.

355
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:56,638
She's not mine.

356
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,361
She's not his either...

357
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
Not yet.

358
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:11,393
It's just dinner. Relax.

359
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:14,231
Trust me, there is no "just"
when House is involved.

360
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:16,091
We're in the middle of a restaurant.

361
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:17,966
What could he possibly...

362
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:19,357
Do?

363
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,442
That.

364
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:28,281
Sorry we're late.
But you know girls.

365
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,486
Always fiddling with the hair
and the makeup.

366
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,904
James, Sam... This is Sarah.

367
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:35,707
It's nice to meet you.
Horace has told me all...

368
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,360
House... has told me all about you.

369
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,790
It's nice to meet you.

370
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,545
What's the diagnosis?

371
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,720
His muscle biopsy is clean.

372
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:52,515
It's not trichinosis.

373
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,868
House was wrong,
this is not environmental.

374
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:58,724
Or we screwed up and missed something
at the Renaissance fair.

375
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:00,091
You think we did?

376
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:02,766
No, but I think House
will think we did.

377
00:24:03,217 --> 00:24:04,762
What could we have missed?

378
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,237
Fungal infection?

379
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,986
There's nothing in his blood work
even remotely suggesting that.

380
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:12,861
But it fits the symptoms.

381
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:16,288
You wanna re-test
every sample we took for spores?

382
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:18,483
We'll be here all night.

383
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,917
Have you noticed
how much pain he's been in lately?

384
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:23,154
And that's relevant how?

385
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,838
Extra pain means extra cranky,

386
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,606
it means off his game.

387
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:29,217
He's not gonna accept
this isn't environmental

388
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,292
unless we give him no choice.

389
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:41,137
I can't believe
you're from Bloomington.

390
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:43,012
I know, isn't it amazing?

391
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:46,265
Delightful.

392
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,653
Ignore him.
He's just upset that we're having fun.

393
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,947
Do you remember that little bakery?

394
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,075
- The one with the amazing cupcakes?
- Gino's.

395
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,994
First stop, every time I go home.

396
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,162
Me too...

397
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:01,297
- Remember that strip club?
- I used to work at that strip club.

398
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:09,633
- Where does it hurt, William?
- My legs! Feels like they're on fire!

399
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:25,602
Rhabdomyolysis means
his kidneys are failing.

400
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:29,312
Also means it's not environmental.
We need to move on.

401
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:34,112
- I recommend a full cancer workup...
- Who checked out the apartment?

402
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:38,824
- His symptoms fit an environmental...
- The test results don't, we redid...

403
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:40,285
Search the apartment.

404
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,494
- He hasn't been there in three weeks...
- Go! Now!

405
00:25:47,627 --> 00:25:49,419
I liked him better
when he was on Vicodin.

406
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:53,297
You and thirteen check out his place.
We'll ultrasound the liver.

407
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:56,300
If it's cancer,
it's as good a place as any to start.

408
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:10,516
I hear House met Sam.

409
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:13,125
First time, he was naked.

410
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,933
The second time he brought
a transvestite prostitute to dinner.

411
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:18,178
Overall, it could have been worse.

412
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:19,303
Great.

413
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:23,725
That's your reaction?

414
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:26,673
Nudity, prostitute...

415
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:29,576
Sorry, preoccupied.

416
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:35,028
House said something to you,
didn't he?

417
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:37,859
He didn't.

418
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:50,929
It is a little crazy, though.
I mean... Isn't it?

419
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:55,996
Things seem to be going great.
But they did, too, 12 years ago.

420
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:57,978
The good things are still good.

421
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:01,491
She's still smart, funny, gets me.
And she's less competitive.

422
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:04,576
Either she's changed, or I've changed.
But, either way...

423
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,212
Am I out of my mind?

424
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:13,877
You never know what can happen.

425
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:16,406
You might as well give it a chance.

426
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:26,848
You were right.

427
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,319
Tumors...

428
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,820
Dozens of them.
Inside, and on the surface.

429
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:34,683
Pull in closer.

430
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,027
See that?

431
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:44,951
What is that?

432
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:47,111
I don't know.

433
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:49,286
But it's definitely not cancer.

434
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:06,138
Kitchen's clean.

435
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:08,260
Bedroom as well.

436
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:11,310
Most dangerous thing in his cabinet
was dental floss.

437
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,521
It's locked, key wasn't on his ring.

438
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:19,131
You wanna go back and tell House
we didn't check every square inch?

439
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:21,137
Of course not.

440
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:38,628
My hero.

441
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:51,772
What the hell is this?

442
00:28:53,794 --> 00:28:56,494
Either a secret entrance to Hogwarts,
or...

443
00:28:58,771 --> 00:28:59,921
Our knight...

444
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,106
is a witch.

445
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:17,450
Our knight is into
some seriously creepy stuff.

446
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:20,444
He claims it's just sugar water
but we sent the rest for testing.

447
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:21,956
You think he poisoned himself?

448
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:24,535
We would have picked it up
in his blood work.

449
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,554
Not if it collected
slowly in his liver

450
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:29,239
and it all started leaking
into his system at once.

451
00:29:29,364 --> 00:29:31,341
These tumors that aren't tumors,

452
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,997
what if they're focal hepatic lesions
filled with blood?

453
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:37,333
Every time one explodes
it'd be releasing another dose.

454
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,458
Of what?

455
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:43,492
<i>Plumbum nigrum.</i>

456
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:47,648
- You putting a hex on someone?
- It's Latin, for black lead.

457
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:49,831
Our knight/warlock

458
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:51,778
apparently also dabbles in alchemy.

459
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:53,926
Lead poisoning.

460
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:56,157
Seizures, paralysis,
weak immune system,

461
00:29:56,326 --> 00:29:57,535
and eventually, coma.

462
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,410
Biopsy the cysts,
and you'll find your lead.

463
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:09,819
You think we'll make the 7:30?

464
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:12,787
If I don't change, I'm gonna feel like
I'm at work all night.

465
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,062
- I remember.
- Is it a problem?

466
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:16,835
Not at all.

467
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:18,848
In fact,

468
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:20,853
if we hurry...

469
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:25,771
We will definitely
not make the 7:30.

470
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,939
There's always the 9:40.

471
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:40,409
Or not.

472
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:48,918
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

473
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:51,754
Wouldn't need a team
if I did all the work.

474
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:54,048
- Plus, I had to make you dinner.
- We have plans.

475
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,874
I bet your plans
don't taste like this.

476
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,731
Don't!

477
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,330
- Whatever it is that you're up to...
- I'm trying to be nice.

478
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:13,099
What I did the other night
was juvenile, I'm sorry.

479
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:31,814
- The soufflÃ© was amazing.
- It's my mom's recipe.

480
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:33,546
Everything else, I got off the web.

481
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:36,642
Here's to the Internet.

482
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,259
Where I found the lamb ragout,

483
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:40,262
and you two found each other...

484
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:41,387
Again.

485
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,020
It wasn't just the Internet.

486
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:45,988
More like divorce, depression,

487
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,988
therapy, more therapy,
and the Internet.

488
00:31:49,802 --> 00:31:51,004
And here we are.

489
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:52,879
Exactly. And here we are.

490
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:01,908
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- You're old enough, now.

491
00:32:02,306 --> 00:32:03,943
But if you want me to gowith you...

492
00:32:04,495 --> 00:32:06,745
Is it safe to leave the two of you?

493
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,661
Come on, James. Enough, already.

494
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:10,758
I cook in peace.

495
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:14,574
I'll be right back.

496
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:26,974
You're a cold-hearted bitch,
who ripped his heart out.

497
00:32:27,703 --> 00:32:30,394
I watched him struggle for years
to overcome the damage you did.

498
00:32:30,563 --> 00:32:32,262
No way I'm gonna let you

499
00:32:32,387 --> 00:32:35,110
wheel him back in so you can do it
all over again.

500
00:32:39,716 --> 00:32:41,087
And all this?

501
00:32:41,797 --> 00:32:44,247
Phase two
of getting to know my enemy.

502
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,828
You're wrong about me.

503
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:51,678
But I'm glad now
I don't have to pretend to like you,

504
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,043
except for when James
is standing next to me.

505
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:55,298
Same here.

506
00:32:55,896 --> 00:32:58,172
Only difference is,
I'll outlast you.

507
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,565
And scene.

508
00:33:05,835 --> 00:33:08,035
Well, it's too late for the movie.

509
00:33:08,463 --> 00:33:10,600
- Wanna see what's on TV?
- Absolutely.

510
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:12,472
Love to.

511
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,903
There wasn't any lead in his blood work
or liver biopsy.

512
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:25,206
And his heart rate and BP
are getting even more erratic.

513
00:33:25,331 --> 00:33:28,198
We had to shock it back into rhythm
twice during the night.

514
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:34,621
There's only one thing left to do.

515
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:45,062
We're wasting our time.

516
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:47,452
Actually,
I've already gotten good value.

517
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,606
Nothing here could have caused
any of his symptoms.

518
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:54,089
You couldn't find anything here
that could be causing the symptoms.

519
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:56,699
We're gonna find something new
because we're in costume?

520
00:33:56,824 --> 00:33:59,374
We looked everywhere,
tested everything.

521
00:33:59,952 --> 00:34:03,062
Just because Wilson's acting stupid
doesn't mean we are.

522
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:05,136
Do you think he's making a mistake?

523
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:06,811
Of course.

524
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:08,890
He'll figure it out,
sooner or later.

525
00:34:09,015 --> 00:34:12,425
Hopefully after weeks of great sex.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

526
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,092
Wilson's not like us.

527
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:16,553
He cares too much about people
and their feelings.

528
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:17,678
Thanks.

529
00:34:17,803 --> 00:34:20,327
The code that our knight
claims to live by,

530
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:22,574
all that crap
about honor and chivalry.

531
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,231
Wilson's naturally like that,
which is why he's...

532
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,456
A great guy.

533
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,910
A sucker and a target.

534
00:34:29,035 --> 00:34:30,985
So we gotta look out for him.

535
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:34,451
Do you smell that?

536
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:36,331
It's the apothecary shop.

537
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:38,606
And yes, Foreman and I already...

538
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:49,139
I cry your pardon, sir.

539
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:53,935
- You know what this is?
- That's lavender.

540
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:55,303
Try rose hips.

541
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,650
Both harmless, who cares?

542
00:34:58,206 --> 00:35:00,233
It could be cyanide
as far as he knows.

543
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:05,113
- How about this?
- It be nothing but St. John's wort.

544
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:07,490
Wrong again. Black cohash.

545
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:11,349
My uncle owns the shop,
I just started apprenticing.

546
00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:12,734
What's the big deal?

547
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:18,339
I just organized all that.

548
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:25,658
- You know what this is?
- A wild carrot?

549
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,541
It's hemlock,

550
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,273
you embossed carbuncle.

551
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:35,317
- That's hemlock? You sure?
- Did you sell it to anyone?

552
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,249
It's poison, think hard.

553
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,484
It was just one branch.

554
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,260
You sold it to sir William?

555
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,580
To the king.

556
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,232
It's the only part of the environment
you didn't check.

557
00:35:55,018 --> 00:35:56,718
The people living in it.

558
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:06,312
What's going on?
Why can't we see William?

559
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:08,813
Because you poisoned him.

560
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:11,484
Your royal anus.
With this.

561
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,845
- Wild carrots?
- Hemlock.

562
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:16,983
I need to know how much you used
and how you prepared it.

563
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,086
- You did something to William?
- Of course not!

564
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,703
He's still alive.
You want to avoid a murder charge,

565
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:22,985
start talking fast.

566
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:26,332
The apothecary's willing to testify
that you're the only one he gave it to.

567
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:29,711
I bought it for the food challenge,
but I didn't know that was hemlock.

568
00:36:29,997 --> 00:36:31,897
If it was for the challenge,

569
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,424
then why is Wee Willie
the only knight who's dying?

570
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:35,670
I don't know!

571
00:36:35,795 --> 00:36:38,136
I didn't know!
Why would I want to hurt William?

572
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,513
I can think of at least one reason.

573
00:36:41,257 --> 00:36:42,390
Miles, please.

574
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:45,185
Whatever happened,
just tell them the truth.

575
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:46,353
I am!

576
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:48,836
I swear.

577
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,797
We ran a gas chromatography
on his blood.

578
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,946
Found trace amounts
of piperidine alkaloids.

579
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,698
Markers of hemlock intoxication.

580
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,993
The good news is
we now know what's wrong with you.

581
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:05,061
The bad news is
that your king's precious ideals

582
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:07,086
were just pretend after all.

583
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,792
When it comes to guys
who get too close to his queen.

584
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,010
It's not true.

585
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:17,717
You've never heard the expression,
"gas chromatography machines don't lie".

586
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:19,335
Neither does Miles.

587
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:21,888
He's the best knight
I've ever known.

588
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,193
It's why he was chosen king.

589
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:26,068
Miles is a jealous idiot.

590
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,193
And you're just an idiot.

591
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,309
Something's wrong.

592
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:33,643
We performed a gastric lavage
and administered activated charcoal,

593
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:36,164
but he's getting worse, not better.

594
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,479
It's been in his system two days.
We're lucky he's lasted this long.

595
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:41,115
If it was hemlock, he'd be dead

596
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:42,584
or getting better.

597
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:44,304
We found it in his blood.

598
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,973
He may have had some,
but it's not what's killing him.

599
00:37:53,766 --> 00:37:54,866
Don't do it!

600
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:57,507
Whatever you're planning,
especially if you're using that.

601
00:37:57,854 --> 00:37:58,854
Geez.

602
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:00,593
It was just sitting in a stone.

603
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,279
Here.

604
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:06,136
It's gonna cost extra, because
of the level of detail you wanted.

605
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:07,389
Anything good?

606
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:09,635
And by good, I, of course, mean bad.

607
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:12,046
Typical life.

608
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:13,684
Married young, got divorced.

609
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:16,192
Married a little less young,
got divorced.

610
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:19,210
She's been pretty successful,
except marriage.

611
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:21,739
- There's gotta be something I can use.
- Maybe.

612
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,867
Didn't read her shrink's notes.
Didn't seem right.

613
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:26,995
But stealing them did.

614
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:29,831
I didn't steal them,
I found a way to obtain them.

615
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:32,881
Excuse me,
I don't mean to interrupt,

616
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:34,638
but you got a minute?

617
00:38:35,118 --> 00:38:36,118
Sure.

618
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:40,074
Oh, him? Yeah, I was just leaving.

619
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,470
Careful.

620
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,073
I have a sword.

621
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:50,622
I don't agree with what you said.

622
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:52,897
But I understand why you said it.

623
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:55,690
We were married young,
we both made mistakes,

624
00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:58,869
and yes, I did make most of them.

625
00:38:58,994 --> 00:39:00,656
But that was almost a decade ago.

626
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,407
I'm sorry, is that the statutory period
for soul sucking?

627
00:39:05,253 --> 00:39:07,653
I'm not asking you
to like me, House.

628
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,747
To be honest, I think you're an ass.

629
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:12,429
But we do have one thing in common.

630
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:15,446
We care about James.

631
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:18,046
So prove it. And dump him... again.

632
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:21,507
You're insufferable all the time,
aren't you?

633
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:23,325
Sorry, go on. And, yes.

634
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,043
We just reconnected, we have no idea

635
00:39:26,168 --> 00:39:27,618
where we're headed.

636
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:30,702
But is it really too much to ask

637
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,485
that you gave us a chance
to find out?

638
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,820
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.

639
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:16,124
We did it.

640
00:40:16,987 --> 00:40:18,237
Well, I did it.

641
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:19,774
What did we do?

642
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:23,213
You do?

643
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:27,178
These aren't focal hepatic lesions,
they're peliosis hepitus lesions.

644
00:40:27,303 --> 00:40:29,325
Which in combination
with an erratic heart rate,

645
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,452
- usually indicates...
- Endocarditis.

646
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:32,971
Infection on his heart valve.

647
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:35,971
Two major symptoms
of anabolic steroid abuse.

648
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,584
- No, he wouldn't.
- And the rhabdo makes the third.

649
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:40,402
Our patient's a juicer.

650
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:44,590
Ancient poison accelerated the damage
of the modern poison.

651
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,844
Start treatment,
let the king out of the tower.

652
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:56,949
How are you feeling?

653
00:40:57,212 --> 00:40:58,212
Ashamed.

654
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,210
You should be.

655
00:41:01,924 --> 00:41:04,193
You'll compromise your ideals
to win a fight,

656
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,984
but not to go
for the woman you love.

657
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:10,001
That was a game.

658
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:11,609
Not real life.

659
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:14,412
- I didn't...
- Hurt anyone?

660
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,352
Try telling that to Shannon.

661
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:19,751
Or maybe I missed something
while she was crying by your bed.

662
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:22,712
You don't need to win
anyone's heart.

663
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:25,531
You just need to ask for it.

664
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:37,517
Miles is a great guy.

665
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,568
He's rich, smart, treats her well.

666
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:42,742
She's gonna have
a great life with him.

667
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:44,903
But me?

668
00:41:45,385 --> 00:41:47,001
I'd do everything I could for her,

669
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:51,012
but even at my best, it wouldn't be much
and she deserves the best.

670
00:41:53,915 --> 00:41:57,014
I guess I'd rather she be happy
even if it means I'm not.

671
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:03,495
I guess House was right about that,
too.

672
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:04,932
What?

673
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,200
You really are an idiot.
