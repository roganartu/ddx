all bets are off.

00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,195

Actually,
it would if you were right.

185

prove it.

Oh, you thought I didn't
know who Wendy Lee was?

195
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:48,491
Yeah, makes sense.
I'm not good at names.

196
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:49,892
Did Dr. Fortune
tell you that?

197
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,393
Her last boyfriend
was a real nut.

198
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:52,561
He's basically stalking her.

199
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:53,895
See, this is what
I don't care about.

200
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:55,497
I don't care who cares
about her.

201
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:57,198
Used to care about her.

Either one you falls down dead,
you can drop me a note.

I think I know what's wrong
with her.

204
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:04,672
You screwed up
in the lab

205
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,676
and accidentally spilled
some bomb on her?

206
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:09,445
No.

207
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:13,083

00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,087
Apparently our mad scientist

210
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,089
is also a slutty scientist

211
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:21,359
whose milkshakes got all
the nerds in the yard

212
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,994
fighting over her.

213
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,196
She's a slut because she's dated
two different guys at work?

214
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,497
Oh, I'm sorry.

215
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:27,731
I thought we were
still judging her.

216
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,366
She's not a slut
and it's not poison.

217
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,301
When we tested her blood
and cerebral spinal fluid

218
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:32,602
for toxic exposure,
it was negative

219
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,803
for every poison
we could think of.

220
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,004
Well, that just leaves

221
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,739
every poison we didn't
think of.

222
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:38,641
<i>She works in a bomb factory.</i>

223

<i>(Foreman)</i>
<i>So do a lot of other not-sick people.</i>

224
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:41,143
The guy had any
actual evidence

225
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,511
she was poisoned, he would
have gone to the police,

226
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,213
not to us.

227
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,481
And if we had any evidence
of what was wrong with her,

228
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:46,582
you'd be showing us
MRI results.

229
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,619
I assume they were negative.

230
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:51,488
Couldn't hurt to start activated
charcoal, see what happens.

231

You know what else
wouldn't hurt?

232
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,092
This case is getting
interesting.

233
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,727
Let's add a little danger.

234
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:11,908
Hmm.

Just because he has guns

237
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,718
doesn't make him a murderer.

Tell that to the bear.
<i>Look in the desk.</i>

239

See if he's got a diary
or a journal.

240
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,555
Something tells me he's
not exactly

241
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:27,623
a diary kind of guy.

242
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,125
Maybe a manifesto.

00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:30,326
Just look.

00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:31,627

the rest of the place,

00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,062
see if he's got a computer.

[Bottles clang]

252
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,840
Looks like she actually
was being poisoned,

253
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:47,109
but she's been doing it
to herself.

254

I'm not an alcoholic.
I know.

255
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,154
I know the whole label thing
is so limiting.

256
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:56,625
You're a person who happens
to suffer from alcoholism.

257
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:59,929
You broke into my house and now
you're being a smartass?

258
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:02,465
During your history, you said
you didn't drink at all.

I don't.

- You just collect bottles.
- Yes.

261
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:08,270
I collect them for my friend.

262
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:10,539
She uses them
in her art projects.

263
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:11,706
And you're ashamed
of these art projects.

264
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:13,208
The bottles were hidden.

265
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:16,111
That's because my housekeeper
keeps throwing them out.

266
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:17,712
I've told her
a dozen times not to,

267
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,148
but either she doesn't
understand or she doesn't care.

268
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:25,086
- Why would she lie?
- That's the easy question.

269
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:27,222
She needs a government security
clearance for her job.

270
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,523
And what's
the hard question?

271
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:30,058
If she's an alcoholic,
why doesn't she have

272
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:32,494
at least some partially-full
bottles in the house?

273
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:33,729
I mean, why keep
the empties?

274
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:35,097
Why not just
throw them away?

275
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:37,600
So she's probably
telling the truth.

276
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:40,303
So what do we do?

277
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:45,074
We start her on valium
for alcohol withdrawal.

It's the best
we've got right now.

I stopped her treatment.

your kidneys are not working,

740
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:29,242
Six.

about you and Glenn,

880
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
which, he admitted,
shouldn't have surprised him

881
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:55,063
since he started seeing you
while you were dating Tony.

882
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:58,133
He poisoned me?

883
00:40:58,201 --> 00:41:01,637
Repeatedly...
With Spanish fly.

884
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:03,906
The active ingredient
cantharidin is a potent toxin

885
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:06,909
and can cause a lot
of the same damage as radiation.

886
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,381
He poisoned me?

887
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:18,220
I'm sorry.

888
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:23,558
He had a security clearance.

889
00:41:23,626 --> 00:41:26,394
[Sonny Boy Williamson's
<i>unseen Eye]</i>

890
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:27,395
Ahem!

891
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:29,730
<i>What's this?</i>

892
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:32,599
A palm.

893
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,469
Hmm, useful for
many things.

894
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:39,808
Slapping, greasing, probably
some other applications too.

895
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:43,012
Right now it's ready
for $50 and humiliation.

896
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,682
He was actually sick?

897
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,117
He wasn't knocked out
by the punch.

898
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:49,119
He was knocked out by
the clinch before the punch.

899
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:51,589
<i>Took a shot to the back</i>
<i>of the neck.</i>

900
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,424
More specifically,
to an abnormal growth of nerves

901
00:41:53,492 --> 00:41:55,760
caused by a glomus tumor.

902
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:57,429
Kind of like a built-in taser.

903
00:41:57,496 --> 00:41:59,164
Sent a massive shock
to his entire body,

904
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:00,699
shut everything down.

905
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:03,402
Wow.
Fascinating.

906
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:06,671
Completely explains exactly
how he lost.

907
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:08,073
Oh, you are not gonna
be like that,

908
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:10,308
'cause you got
a lot more posters here.

909
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:12,410
No, I'm not.

910
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:13,878
Well done, House.

911
00:42:13,946 --> 00:42:15,413
You might have saved
that guy.

912
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:16,815
Given him his life back.

913
00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:18,817
Oh, no.
He needs surgery.

914
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:22,022
He's never gonna fight again.

915
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:24,624
What happened to your eye?

916
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:25,625
You okay?

917
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:27,861
Better than okay.
