00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,800
Here you go.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,000
That fried crap
will kill you. See?

(BELL JINGLING)

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,000
WAITRESS: Good night.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,080
Time to make the donuts.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,120
Hands in the air! Right now!
Get them up!

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,440
Move out here. Get up!
Move out here! Let's go!

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,840
Move it.
Put them up!

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,760
Purses and wallets
on the counter, right now.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,840
Yo! Your watches,
your jewelry!
Take it all off!

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,680
Yeah, all right.
Keep the girl.
Keep the girl.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,720
Yeah.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,680
We're moving to
the back room. Let's go!

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,680
Go! Let's go!
Move it!

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Go on! Not you.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,160
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,360
She's staying right here.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,640
You're not going to do this.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,200
Whoa, whoa, kid.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
No, Jeremy.
Please, just do
what they say. Please!

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Okay. Okay.
Yeah. Move!

22

(COUGHING)

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,760
Son of a bitch!

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,800
You thought I was
going to let you
hurt my wife?

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,600
Hey! Hey, sir. Your wife!

26

(GASPING)

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,920
What did he do to her?

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
Nothing.

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,240
Tracy!

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,960
CAMERON: Twenty-year-old
married
African-American female.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,080
Couldn't breathe.
Anaphylaxis-like
throat swelling.

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,800
Children?
You think pregnancy
would explain...

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,960
Explains the marriage.

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,440
Who the hell
gets married at 20?

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,880
I'm guessing,
people in love?

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Show me a 20-year-old
who's not in love.

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,000
You get married at 20,
you're going to be shocked at
who you're living with at 30.

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,960
CAMERON: It's not allergies.
Negative on the skin test.

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,960
Four days of antihistamines
and steroids.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,440
Who's he talking to?
What?

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,560
It's got an ass.
Technically, that
makes it a "who."

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,000
New nurse in peds.
Wendy something.

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,560
Swelling just started
to go down...

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,960
You seen her here before?

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,080
A couple times. I tried
following her home,
but she gave me the slip.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,920
Swelling's...

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,920
(LAUGHING)

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
You think that's funny?

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,840
Ask him about the time
he sabotaged my cane.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
Are you serious?

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,320
There was a point to it.
Wendy, this is House.

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,480
Something about not getting
too uppity with normal folks
who walk good.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,080
You're everything I'd heard.
Nice to meet you.

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
Why so rude?

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,280
You've sprinted through
three bad marriages

56
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
into an affair with
a dying patient.
Now a naughty nurse?

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,240
How many more failed
relationships are we both
gonna have to deal with

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800
before you learn to
love yourself?

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,080
And I mean that
in the literal way.

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,520
It's amazing how you can
not only know
it's a relationship,

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,360
but that it's a
bad relationship, based on
nothing but nothing.

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,680
I know you.

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm not with her,
not even trying.

64
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,920
You're lying to me.
That's interesting.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,360
Well, as long as
it's interesting.

66
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,160
Swelling is...
Why is she hanging out here?

67
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,960
Anyone interested
in what happened
with the swelling?

68
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,760
She's in peds.
That's the next wing over.

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,800
If you're wondering if
Wilson's dating her,
ask Wilson.

70
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,800
Clearly he did, and
Wilson denied it. And
House doesn't believe it.

71
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,880
That's gotta hurt. That's why
it pays to have more
than one friend, House.

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,840
If he's not hitting that,
why is she here?

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Because I'm hitting that
and it's totally hot.

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,880
Swelling took four days
to resolve.

75
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Patient has unexplained
intense abdominal pains.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,600
So explain them.

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,800
Wake me when they've done
an exploratory laparotomy.

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,400
Anybody know her?
Know her story?

79
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,840
Up and at 'em.

80
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,360
They did a laparotomy.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,040
Liver, bowel, gall bladder,
appendix, all clean.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,920
Belly pain plus
throat swelling.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,440
She was in some sort of
assault, right?
Simple neck trauma.

84
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,040
It says no one touched
her neck, and if they did,
it would resolve by now.

85
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,920
Didn't need to touch her.
Some guy coughed
on her, right?

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
He's in jail and
he's completely healthy,

87
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,920
except for the broken head
he got from
the beating he took.

88
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,040
There's pot on her tox screen.

89
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,720
Salmonella from the pot
would explain
the stomach pains.

90
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,480
It's a stretch.
She'd have a fever.

91
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,120
She's on steroids
for the swelling,
therefore no fever.

92
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
And the smoking
explains the throat.

93
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,400
Sorry, take it back.
That's a stretch.

94
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,200
Got a better idea?

95
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,960
Then stretch away.

96
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,000
Start her on fluoroquinolone
for the salmonella.

97
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,920
I was waiting
two hours out there.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
Fascinating.

99
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,200
Have you considered a career
as a memoirist?

100
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,640
Let's see it.

101
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,760
You don't introduce yourself?

102
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,280
Sorry, I thought
you were waiting two hours.

103
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
Didn't know
you wanted to chat.

104
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,680
Hi, I'm Greg.
How about that
local sports team?

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,640
It's not an infection.

106
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
How can you tell without...

107
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,920
You want me to touch you?

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
It's your private place.

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,960
You're chewing nicotine gum,
which causes dehydration,
which causes wear and tear.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,880
Try a lubricant,
or foreplay if you're cheap.

111
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,200
Just take a swab
and get it tested, okay?

112
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,760
Sorry, I already met
this month's quota of useless
tests for stubborn idiots.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
You're rude.

114
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,960
Wow. You're like a
detective or something.

115
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,800
And you're smart
and you're funny.

116
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,320
But you are bitter
and you're lonely,

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,920
so you treat everyone around
like they're idiots,

118
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,960
and you get away with it
'cause of your cane.

119
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,520
Please stop. It's hard to
write through the haze
of bitter tears.

120
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,760
But you're not actually
getting away with it.

121
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,480
Last nurse you made fun of,
she probably slipped some
crap into your coffee.

122
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,880
Yeah, I asked for
decrapinated coffee.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,480
Treat people like jerks,
you get treated like a jerk.

124
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,920
Thank you.

125
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,840
Bend over.

126
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,360
You kidding me?
If you have an infection,
you'd have a fever.

127
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,920
But you're chewing
nicotine gum,

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
which messes with the weather
in your mouth,

129
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,880
so I need to
vacation elsewhere.

130
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
(WINCING)

131
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
And wait till I put
the thermometer in.

132
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,440
You break it, you bought it.

133
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
Leaving early today.

134
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,680
Do you ever get that thing
where you're sure
you forgot something,

135
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,920
but you can't figure out what?

136
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,040
Guess it can't be
that important.

137
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,320
Salmonella is a bacterial
infection that you can
get from pot plants.

138
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
It causes stomach pain.

139
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,560
And my throat?

140
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,400
The thinking is it's
an inflammatory reaction
to the smoking.

141
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,000
How much would you need
to smoke for your throat
to go nuts like that?

142
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
Most cases, a lot.

143
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,760
We don't smoke a lot.

144
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
Let's just start
the treatment.

145
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,240
You think we're liars,
as well as druggies?

146
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,680
Actually, I'm wondering if
you'd mind getting her
a cup of ice chips.

147
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,440
You're not gonna get
any different answer from her.

148
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,800
No, no. He can stay.

149
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,800
No offense, but this place
is scary. I feel better
when he's around.

150
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,120
Tracy, I need to talk to you.

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,880
We don't do a lot of drugs.

152
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,360
I need to know
your answers aren't
being pressured.

153
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,280
Look, if you think the
antibiotics are a good idea,
you can give them to me.

154
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,160
Okay. Worst-case scenario,
it'll help us rule out
a few things.

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
He's a good guy.

156
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
He just has a hard time
holding in his emotions.

157
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,360
You don't have to
apologize for me.

158
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,000
That mean you're
going to do it for yourself?

159
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,720
I got nothing to
apologize for.

160
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,040
He's young.

161
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,560
Itchy.

162
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,200
HOUSE: Allergic reaction
to the fluoroquinolone.

163
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,760
We should switch to
a different antibiotic.
Why?

164
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,520
We can't treat the
salmonella unless...
Salmonella?

165
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,680
That was a total stretch.

166
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,600
Oh, man, why does that
sound so familiar?

167
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,160
You think it's 'cause
I said it an hour ago?

168
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,920
Then it was a dumb thing
to say. Now it's smart.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,440
She's got the rash, so we know
she's unusually susceptible
to allergic reactions,

170
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,720
so that's what brought her in.

171
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,400
Probably the peanut butter
in her sandwich.

172
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,680
Stick test was negative
for peanuts.

173
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,320
That's because you
foolishly tested her while
she was lying down.

174
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,480
Exercise-based anaphylaxis?
I think that
requires exercise.

175
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,080
When her throat closed,
they'd just got done eating.

176
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,360
Not even competitive eating.

177
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,680
And getting robbed.
That always gets
my heart rate up.

178
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,120
Give her the same food
she ate at the diner

179
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
and stick her
on the treadmill.

180
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,480
Better yet, put a gun
to her head,
threaten to rape her.

181
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,120
You don't think
I'm going to get a response?

182
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,520
No.

183
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,120
You're on. Fifty bucks.

184
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
I'm not betting
on a patient's...

185
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,160
A hundred bucks.
If you say so.

186
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,080
<i>Tracy, I'm increasing
the speed a little.</i>

187
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,400
My stomach really hurts.

188
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,920
Jeremy, you out there?
Talk to... Talk...

189
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,240
You're doing great.
Isn't this enough?

190
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,240
We're not getting
any allergic response yet.

191
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
Shut it off.

192
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,560
We don't complete the test,

193
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,240
my boss will just
come down here
and do it himself.

194
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,520
You do not want that.

195
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,120
She's in pain. Look at her.

196
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,840
I don't want to have to
ask you to leave.

197
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,120
You're gonna ask me to leave?
Are you kidding me?
This is my wife!

198
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,280
You guys aren't helping her.
You're just hurting her. What?

199
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,840
You guys have all
this equipment here,
and you're not doing anything!

200
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,840
You guys can't even
figure out what's...

201
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,160
(GROANING)

202
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,320
God, it hurts.

203
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,160
Where?
In my stomach. And my chest.

204
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,760
Oh, God!
It's Foreman.
Get me a wheelchair.

205
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,440
FOREMAN: He's as sick as
she is now.

206
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,640
I told you it wouldn't work.

207
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,200
It worked on
the wrong patient.

208
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,760
We could spend all day
arguing right or wrong.

209
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Give me the 100 bucks.

210
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,240
We didn't bet.

211
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,800
We could spend all day
arguing whether we bet or not.

212
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,040
Give me the 100 bucks.

213
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,800
Come on, Foreman, pay up.
He won. Or we could just
never finish the DDX.

214
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Husband's test showed no MI,
no aortic dissection.
It's not his heart.

215
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,440
It's just nonspecific
chest and abdominal pain.

216
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,760
So, psychosomatic?
Panic attack?

217
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Pain persisted after
he got lorazepam and morphine.

218
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,720
Whose locker is that?

219
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,920
Mine.

220
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,920
Chest, stomach, throat.

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,720
What does it all mean?
We're in the nurses'
locker room.

222
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,160
I know that.

223
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,680
Oh, that is so annoying.

224
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,880
Wilson's girlfriend's
left her stuff in
my locker again.

225
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,600
Great. I hadn't committed
any felonies yet today.

226
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,360
Relax. You know who
they're going to blame.

227
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,800
House, you want to mess
with Wilson, no problem.

228
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
But you got no reason
to screw around with...

229
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,440
Can we get back
to the medicine?
FOREMAN: Okay.

230
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,040
Why assume one disease?
His chest, her throat.

231
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,200
So it's just a coincidence
that they've both got
crippling stomach pains?

232
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,560
Wow, they really are
a great couple.
So much in common.

233
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,920
One blue shoe.
What do you think that means?

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
It means you're insane.
Wilson's not dating her.

235
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
You feeling luckier?

236
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,360
It doesn't matter
what I answer.

237
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,600
Two hundred it is.

238
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,320
If they're married and caught
the same disease,
then it means they...

239
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,000
Brochure to a jazz festival
in the Poconos this weekend.

240
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,000
Wilson likes jazz.
Foreman, pay the man.

241
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,480
Four, five, six novels,
no music.
What does that mean?

242
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,560
She's literate.

243
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,240
It means she spends
her leisure time reading,
not listening.

244
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,600
She'd only want to go
and watch jazz if
the other person wanted to go.

245
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,680
She has a martyr complex,
issues of inferiority.

246
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,200
Married couple, same disease.

247
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,720
They either got it
from each other or
in the same place.

248
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,840
Infectious or environmental?

249
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,560
What we have to do is
check out parasites,
viruses, bacteria, fungi,

250
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,840
prions, radiation,
toxins, chemicals.
Or it's Internet porn-related.

251
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,200
I'll check the Internet.
You guys cover
the rest of the stuff.

252
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,000
If they can live here without
killing each other,
they must really be in love.

253
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,320
It's tiny.

254
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,520
How come it's taking you
so long to search it?

255
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,280
Box of condoms in his jacket.

256
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,960
I know you're poor now,
but buy your own.

257
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,920
She's on the pill.

258
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,000
Why would he need condoms?

259
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
No, no, no. Put that back.

260
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,440
Why?

261
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,240
We show that to House,
he'll just call the guy
a cheating bastard.

262
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,360
Look how he is with Wilson.

263
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,520
He'd be right.
Could be an STD.

264
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
One that doesn't give them
any symptoms in
their sexual organs?

265
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,440
They never mentioned anything.
Maybe they're embarrassed.

266
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,480
What else could it be?

267
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,400
You think they just like
the sexy feel of latex
against their genitals?

268
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,640
Maybe the wife
just wants to be
extra-cautious.

269
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,600
Come on.
You really believe that?
Yeah.

270
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,240
Good. Then I'm sure
you'll have no problem
convincing House.

271
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,640
That cheating bastard!

272
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,080
He loves her.

273
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,280
Right, I bet he told you
that she's the
love of his life.

274
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,800
People lie. I get it.

275
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,200
But they don't go up against
two armed gunmen to save
someone unless they...

276
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,640
There's a reason that
we don't let kids vote or
drink or work in salt mines.

277
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
They're idiots.

278
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,680
Twenty-year-olds fall in and
out of love more often than
they change their oil filters,

279
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,840
which they should do
more often.

280
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,080
Sorry. Ridiculous of me
to draw a conclusion

281
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,920
based on actually
observing them.

282
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,680
I should have just depended on
your misanthropic view
of human nature.

283
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
Gonorrhea explains
all their symptoms.

284
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome
for her belly pain,

285
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,640
costochondritis and bladder
infection for his chest
and abdominal pain.

286
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Good.

287
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,520
Now go rub their lying,
cheating privates
with a cotton swab.

288
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,480
Why would you want to
look at our...

289
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,280
Is this because
of the condoms?

290
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,760
You found them in his jacket,
figured he was hiding
something from me.

291
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,440
I thought I was pregnant
last month. It kind of
freaked me out.

292
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm way too young
to have kids.

293
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,920
So you just wanted
to be extra-cautious?

294
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,200
Wish one of us had figured
that out, stuck to his guns.

295
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,480
We've still gotta
check you both.

296
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,320
She's the only girlfriend
I've ever had.

297
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,880
She's the love of...
Please don't say it.

298
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,040
I can't say I love my wife?

299
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,280
We're still going to test you.

300
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,600
What is it? I'm white?

301
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,160
Yeah, that's it.

302
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,800
Jer, I wish you would stop it.
You're really embarrassing.

303
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,760
Everybody thinks
they're so liberal, but I see
how they look at us.

304
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,440
White and black,
especially black.

305
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm sorry, Trace,
but it's true.

306
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,200
Great. Prove us all wrong.

307
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,240
Stupid...

308
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,320
No scarring, no purulent
discharge, and the
NAATs were negative.

309
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,320
They don't have an STD.
(LOUDLY) What's that you say?

310
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,720
You've got a problem
with interracial couples?

311
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,040
Thank you, Chase. No!

312
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,880
Have any of your shorties
ever been whities?

313
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,880
I'm not sure I understand
your ghetto slang, Dr. House.

314
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,800
How many black women
have you dated, by the way?

315
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,840
I don't care about color,
as long as they can help me
breed a superior race.

316
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,320
Yeah, my exes have usually
been black. So what?

317
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,360
It's not a racial thing.
It's cultural. I have more
in common with them.

318
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,000
Like I assume you only date
emotionally stunted bigots.

319
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,120
Sorry, you're right.
That kind of prejudice
is totally fine.

320
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,520
The abdominal pain's
getting worse. We've had to
up their morphine twice.

321
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,720
Take the wife off
the steroids.

322
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,440
She spikes a fever,
we'll know it's an infection.

323
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,920
She doesn't,
it's environmental.

324
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,440
He got off easy.
I almost gave him
a colonoscopy.

325
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,960
That was one of
the stupidest things
you have ever done,

326
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,400
and there is heavy
competition for...

327
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,800
What are you doing?

328
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,880
You only ate
half your breakfast.

329
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,720
Feeling a little sick
this morning?

330
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,840
I'm not pregnant.
They burnt my omelet.

331
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,360
You need to apologize
to this guy.

332
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,880
I am a man of principle.

333
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,640
I don't care how much
time and money
it costs you to defend me.

334
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,920
He wants to kill you.

335
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,280
No empty coffee cups.
Off the caffeine.
Good for baby.

336
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Cups are in the
other wastebasket.
Baby's in your mind.

337
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,760
You can berate patients
all you want.

338
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,160
Shoving objects into
their rectums is assault.

339
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,920
Pay attention to me.

340
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,160
Sorry, that would make
it harder to ignore you.

341
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
Can't ignore that rapidly
expanding first-trimester
ass, though.

342
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,840
Sometimes an ass
is just an ass.

343
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,160
You are not always right,
House. Apologize to the guy.

344
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,440
What are you doing here?
Stay away from my son.

345
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,440
How did you find us?

346
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,360
Stay away from that girl.

347
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,360
(SCREAMING)

348
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,360
Please! Please! Please!
You leave him alone!

349
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,520
What happened?
She's dreaming.
She started yelling.

350
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,000
You're breaking Jeremy's arm.
Please!
No one's hurting him.

351
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,240
Baby, it's me. It's Jeremy.
Tracy, Tracy.

352
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,880
She's okay. Baby,
it was just a bad dream.
Everything's okay.

353
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,040
Tracy. Tracy?

354
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,560
It was an acute delirium.

355
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,480
Well, she's talking, right?
I mean, she's coming
out of it.

356
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,360
No, she's not really talking,
just making sounds.

357
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,200
Okay. When's she
gonna come out?

358
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,360
Jeremy, she's in a coma.

359
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,080
<i>So her vitals
are pretty stable,</i>

360
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,880
but her response to stimuli
is getting weaker,

361
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,680
which means the coma's
getting worse.

362
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,120
Her brain is slowly
shutting down.

363
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,680
Can I see her?

364
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,040
We're getting some more images
to check for masses
or infections.

365
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,840
(GROANING)

366
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
I'll increase your morphine.

367
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,040
Her hallucination.

368
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,840
If you knew what it was,
would that make
any difference?

369
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,080
Medically, I mean.

370
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
Not usually.

371
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,280
Some cases, the form of
a hallucination can tell us

372
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,960
what part of the brain
is being hit.

373
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,720
I think it was about my dad.

374
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,680
Your dad was
breaking your arm?

375
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,320
He was a drunk,
pill-popping racist.

376
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,160
He caught me sneaking
into her house
when we were 13.

377
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,000
She lived next door.

378
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,200
He broke my arm
and threatened her.

379
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,240
We ran off when we were 16.

380
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,000
You still in touch with him?

381
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,080
He killed himself
a couple years ago.

382
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,520
Oh, it's not medical.
I just thought blacks
were the racist ones.

383
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,240
Some generalized
edema throughout,

384
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,880
and areas of increased signal
here, here, here and here.

385
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,120
Damn, all over her brain stem.

386
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,960
Could be plaques,
maybe hyperdensities
from the edema.

387
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,640
Or tumors or anything.

388
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,160
We add brain involvement
to the chest, stomach, throat,
what do we got?

389
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,160
Didn't spike a fever
when we took her
off the steroids,

390
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,280
so it's not an infection.
Leaving environmental.

391
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,520
What flavor?
Environmental doesn't
make sense, either.

392
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,280
If it was a toxin,
we'd see it in their livers.

393
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,120
None of the neighbors
are sick, no coworkers.

394
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
They both got it.

395
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,080
That means infection or
environmental, and since
it's not an infection...

396
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,280
What if they
didn't both get it?

397
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,280
Maybe we got our basic
assumption wrong and
it's two different diseases.

398
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,680
Maybe we didn't and
it's sarcoidosis.

399
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,080
Sarcoidosis isn't infectious
or environmental.

400
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,880
Tell that to the clusters
of sarcoidosis cases.

401
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,880
Firefighters and residents
of pine tar forests?

402
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,080
I did see these two
putting out that blaze
in the Pine Barrens.

403
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,720
If sarcoidosis has
two environmental causes,

404
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,520
it has environmental causes.

405
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,080
We just don't know all
of them yet. Husband's chest.

406
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,040
He has slightly enlarged
hilar lymph nodes.

407
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,080
Sarcoidosis explains
almost all of their symptoms,

408
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,040
including her getting worse
off the steroids.

409
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,720
Doesn't explain
his throat swelling.

410
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,080
That's what "almost" means.

411
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,480
90% of sarcoidosis cases
have lung scarring.

412
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,600
Oh, 90?
Oh, "almost"?

413
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,520
Fine.

414
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,880
Consult a specialist.

415
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,480
If this is more
dating advice...

416
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,400
Love to gossip,
but I got work to do.

417
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,640
Is this sarcoidosis?

418
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,200
It's pretty nonspecific.

419
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,320
It could be granulomas,
could be plaques.
What's this?

420
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,200
Oh! Oh! You stole
Wendy's personnel file?

421
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,840
In a way, aren't we all guilty
of bribing the janitor to take
her file and give it to me?

422
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,920
Yes, I take my share
of the blame, but society's...

423
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,600
First of all,
I'm not dating her.

424
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,040
She is so wrong for you.

425
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,960
You know she filed a form
so the hospital would
take extra withholding?

426
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,160
Who does that?
She's much too cautious
for me.

427
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,600
Point taken.
I'll start dating her

428
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
so I can break up with her
and start dating a stripper.

429
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,440
You're a miserable jerk
who can't stand to be alone.

430
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,360
I didn't try to break up
your marriages.
You did that yourself.

431
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,600
My marriages were so crappy,
I was spending all
my time with you.

432
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,880
Your real fear
is me having
a good relationship.

433
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,000
Yes, it keeps me up at night.

434
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,800
That and the Loch Ness
monster, global warming,
evolution

435
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,960
and other fictional concepts.

436
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,200
Although, big romantic weekend
in the Poconos could
change everything.

437
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,600
You don't... No.

438
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,160
I don't think
it's sarcoidosis.

439
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,600
He says it's sarcoidosis.

440
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,160
Start them both
on methotrexate.

441
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
And if you're wrong?

442
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,760
If Wilson's wrong,
we'll biopsy her
just to be sure.

443
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,120
Her brain stem?

444
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,480
Brain damage is
not only possible,
it's likely.

445
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,400
Good point.
Let's biopsy something safer,
like her shoes.

446
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,640
The husband.
He'd have to give consent.
He can't right now.

447
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,600
Why? Does this guy write
with his stomach?

448
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,320
He has a conflict of interest.

449
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,080
It's not his brain we're
cutting open, but he
still gets all the benefit.

450
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,400
He'd do it
just to save himself.

451
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,840
Or save her.

452
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,280
She's the love of his life,
remember?

453
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,520
He never said that.

454
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
She needs a guardian ad litem.
I can't let you do this.

455
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,120
Well, how are you going
to stop me? Call Cuddy?

456
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,600
Cameron's right.
There's a conflict.

457
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,960
No, there isn't.

458
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,720
Not unless one of them
wants to die a horrible,
painful death.

459
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm sure the guardian
will figure that out.

460
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,880
In a couple days.

461
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,400
Will the guardian convince
the disease to hold off
eating her brain

462
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,840
until we can get
the legalities worked out?

463
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,600
I just don't want some
plaintiff's lawyer owning
my hospital.

464
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,400
Legalities help.

465
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,520
Speaking of which,
did you get your
thermometer back yet?

466
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,840
We had a nice chat.
Did you know he's a Rotarian?

467
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,160
Listen, she'll die
without the biopsy.

468
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,560
I need to cover
the hospital's ass.
You're too biased.

469
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,200
I send you in there,
you'll steamroll over him.

470
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,040
Something goes wrong,
he'll sue us for
not disclosing the risks.

471
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,840
Then have Wilson
talk to the husband.

472
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,120
Wilson kills people
left and right.
No one ever sues him.

473
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,600
Fine, but only if
you apologize
to the clinic guy.

474
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,040
No. Probably better
to just let that couple die.

475
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,720
I don't care if you mean it.
Just do it.

476
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,720
Unfortunately, we don't see
any way around a biopsy.

477
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,200
We'll do all we can
to minimize any damage.

478
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,440
No.

479
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,120
The methotrexate isn't showing
any effects yet.

480
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
You could both be...

481
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,800
She's brilliant.

482
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,080
All A's in college
while working full-time.

483
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,760
I can't do that to her.

484
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,920
And if you both die,
you think she'd want that?

485
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,920
Do it on me instead.

486
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,240
It's not in your brain.
It will be.

487
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,000
It's the same disease,
right? Do it then.

488
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,240
She could die
before you show the symptoms.

489
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,080
Then stop treating me.

490
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,600
Great job.
Why didn't you just
shoot him in the head?

491
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,760
Hold on.
That gives me an idea.

492
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,280
You know what could
save this couple?
Lots of misdirected sarcasm.

493
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,000
They're dead! Yelling at you
might prevent you
from screwing up...

494
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,240
I didn't screw up.
I did my job.

495
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,680
Your job was
to get me the biopsy.

496
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,520
No, it was to present
the patient with his options.

497
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,400
Two options,
biopsy or no biopsy.

498
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,960
He chose a third,
no treatment.
How do you even do that?

499
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,520
Remember when you
used to just weave
elaborate conspiracy theories

500
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,800
about my love life?

501
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,080
Those were such good times.

502
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,760
How much morphine
is the husband on?

503
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,160
We can't increase it any more.
His respirations
are depressed.

504
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,040
Increase it?
Drugs cloud people's judgment.

505
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,160
Cold-turkey the sucker.

506
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
No.

507
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,160
Good point.

508
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
Did I ask you guys
to follow me?

509
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,880
No, which made us nervous.

510
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,400
He'll catch on if he notices
he's off the morphine drip.

511
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,360
Shoot him up with one of
these puppies instead.

512
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,520
No!

513
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,960
You do understand
it's not really a puppy.

514
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,280
It's naloxone.

515
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,240
An opiate blocker?
He'll feel like
he's swallowing a bonfire.

516
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,000
That's pretty unethical,
even for you.

517
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
How is that unethical?
Lt'll lead to a diagnosis.

518
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,360
It's leading to
the torture of the husband

519
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,640
on the off-chance
he'll allow a procedure
on another person.

520
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Which will lead
to a diagnosis.
Didn't I just say that?

521
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,720
Give it up.

522
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,520
Foreman and Cameron
are too ethical, and I'm
too scared of getting sued.

523
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,880
Fine. Now, I'm just going to
find someplace safe
to hide this

524
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,400
so I won't be tempted
to use it.

525
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,520
You're not doing it, either.

526
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,040
What, are you going
to run for it?

527
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,960
If they die now, they'll never
be able to grow old and tired
of each other.

528
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,920
We can't baby-sit
House all day.

529
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,440
Tell Cuddy to put a nurse
by his room.

530
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,800
Damn it!

531
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,120
Atropine? What happened to...

532
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,560
He knew we'd stop him.
He stuck both of them
in his pocket.

533
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,280
That's actually pretty clever.

534
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Guess I can't use
that trick again, huh?

535
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
My stomach!

536
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,200
It was a pretty smart plan,
Jerry, but I'm onto you.

537
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,720
There's only one good reason
to kill the biopsy.

538
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,760
You poisoned your wife,
and you don't want
the coppers to get wise.

539
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,000
No!
Oh, all right.
Then you're just a moron.

540
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,560
Biopsy me!

541
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,480
Only if this thing hits
your brain, you moron.

542
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,800
And I can't stress
that "moron" part enough.

543
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,960
You're killing your wife.

544
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,200
She is the love of my life.

545
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,640
Careful. When she's dead
and you're on wife number two,

546
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,240
you're gonna feel real guilty
about saying that.

547
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,040
Feel that? Get used to it.

548
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,280
Pain's going to get
a lot worse.

549
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,560
No, it won't.

550
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,480
Morphine just isn't working
right now for some reason.

551
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm putting you on a
tranquilizer in the meantime.
It'll work again soon.

552
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,800
Want to bet?

553
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
I don't care about the pain.

554
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,280
I need to be in pain,
because I have to get worse.

555
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,280
It means you can do
the biopsy on me.

556
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,480
Dude, she's in a coma.
Who are you trying to impress?

557
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,440
I'd die for her.

558
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,400
Give up. Or are we going to
wait for him to get all
grown up and cynical?

559
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
I was just going to call you.

560
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,800
I need a court order
to biopsy this woman's brain.

561
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,680
Speaking of litigation...

562
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,680
Michael Tritter,
you know Dr. House.

563
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,400
You guys can talk here.

564
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,720
I don't want to sue you.

565
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,800
Good.

566
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,120
I want to beat
the crap out of you.

567
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,520
Less good.
And I'll tell you why.

568
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,280
You're a bully,

569
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,920
and bullies,
they don't back down

570
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
until they run into someone
stronger and meaner.

571
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,360
But you'll accept an apology?

572
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,760
Yes.

573
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,080
Not really a recipe
for sincerity.

574
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,960
I'm not looking
for sincerity.

575
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,840
I'm looking for humiliation,

576
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,360
something that will make you
think twice before you treat
the next patient like crap.

577
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,200
Here's what's going to happen.

578
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,480
You go brag to your friends

579
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,200
about how you made
the big, nasty doctor
poop in his pants.

580
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,640
I get Cuddy off my back
by telling her that
I humiliated myself.

581
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,680
Here's the catch.
We're both going to be lying.

582
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm not apologizing.

583
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,560
If anything,
you deserved a
bigger thermometer.

584
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,240
What's wrong?
Jeremy's worse.

585
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,880
And that's what's right.

586
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,720
Cut the stubborn jerk's
head open and take a slice.

587
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,920
It's not his brain.

588
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,520
Lactic acid's up to 39.
His intestines are rotting.

589
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
This isn't sarcoidosis.

590
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,240
Then he'll get his wish.

591
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,120
He's dying, just not in a way
that's going to help his wife.

592
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,600
Coma's worse.
She's losing response
to stimuli.

593
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,840
He's vomiting blood
and his lactic acid's 45.

594
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,880
He's got to have
ischemic bowel.
So what?

595
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,160
Well, let's see.
Lack of blood flow's
causing his guts to die,

596
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,280
which will cause him to die,

597
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,840
unless we cut out a few feet
of small intestine and
reattach the ends.

598
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,320
I don't know,
seems worth a mention.

599
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,120
Why does he have it?
What does it tell us?

600
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,320
Small-cell vasculitis?

601
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,880
Good. Now let's hear it again,

602
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,320
but this time with
a more environmental
or infectious feeling.

603
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,840
Or, like I said before,
it might not be
environmental or infectious.

604
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,760
He has vasculitis,
she has porphyria.

605
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,320
Belly pain plus hallucination,
classic symptoms.

606
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,440
It could even cause a coma.

607
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,000
Fine. Start her on
hematin for porphyria.

608
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,360
What about him?

609
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,640
Take out the dead bowel.
It's all we can do.

610
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,040
And biopsy it.
If Foreman's right,
it might save him.

611
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,080
If Foreman's wrong,
the dead bowel
might save both of them.

612
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Bowel's not dead.

613
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,480
Unless he's been tossing down
frosty cans of lactic acid,
bowel is dead.

614
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,240
What we're looking for
is a reason it's dead.

615
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,600
Bowel's not dead.

616
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,840
Just general swelling
and edema. High lactate
was probably from stress.

617
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,120
We just sliced him open
from chest to pubic bone
for nothing.

618
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,880
Nothing's something.

619
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Forget the ischemia.
Add the edema and swelling.

620
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,080
Probably from
cutting him open.

621
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,280
Probably, not definitely.

622
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,520
Okay, back to the beginning.

623
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,240
What did we talk about?
Anything. I want to
hear it all again.

624
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,320
Allergies.
Doesn't fit at all now.

625
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,760
CHASE: STDs. Maybe we
got the wrong one.

626
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,760
What about syphilis?

627
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,600
Neurological symptoms.
He wasn't cheating on her.

628
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,760
Yeah, love of his life.
Don't you have to
wait till he's dead

629
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,080
before you make
that determination?

630
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,840
She's his only
girlfriend ever.

631
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,080
They grew up next door,
ran off together as teenagers.

632
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,120
Sarcoidosis. We only ruled it
out because we thought
he had ischemic...

633
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,880
Why did they run off?
What difference does...

634
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,800
Kids talk about running off.
How many do it?

635
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
What was the reason?

636
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,720
They were trying to escape
his evil, pill-popping,
racist dad.

637
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,920
You would've liked him.
We should do another...

638
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
How do you know
the dad was racist?

639
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,800
He beat up his son for
dating a black girl.
I extrapolated from that.

640
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,800
You see racism everywhere.

641
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,600
Maybe he just didn't
like this black girl.

642
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,640
It's not sarcoid.
We would have seen
granulomas in his...

643
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,400
She has pretty eyes.

644
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,840
Forget infectious.
Forget environmental.

645
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,840
Defective DNA is
keeping them from making
a critical protein,

646
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,760
hence the fluid build-up.

647
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,200
Hits the throat, stomach,
chest and brain.

648
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,760
Angioedema?

649
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,600
Hereditary angioedema.
Symptoms fit perfectly.

650
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,320
It's an incredibly
rare disease. They both would
have to have a parent...

651
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,600
Is it a coincidence
that your sister
has great hair,

652
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,520
or that these two
have green eyes?

653
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,840
You're not saying...
They're not
brother and sister.

654
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,960
God, no. That would be sick.

655
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,880
Half brother and sister.
Different moms.

656
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,520
Dad must have had
an affair with her mom.

657
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,720
That's why he flipped out
when the kids started dating.

658
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,520
He had it himself.
Probably why the pills.

659
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,760
We won't know for sure...

660
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,240
Testing for HAE or paternity
is going to take a day.

661
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,000
She doesn't have a day.
Start treating and
see what happens.

662
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,600
Any change?

663
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,160
Her response to stimuli
is still just as weak.

664
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,440
I almost hope
she stays in a coma.

665
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,040
That's sweet, Cameron.

666
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,000
I'd like to avoid shattering
both of their lives.

667
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,160
You don't think
dying will do that?

668
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,560
(BEEPING)

669
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,360
It's just her oximeter.

670
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Tracy.

671
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,840
Tracy.

672
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,040
She's awake.

673
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,360
Oh, God, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

674
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,520
Awesome. Can I tell them?

675
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,800
We've obviously got to
let them know what's wrong.

676
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,960
But the cause,
the brother-sister thing...

677
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,240
Good plan. We just gotta
keep them away from doctors,
the Internet

678
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,720
and anyone who's
not a total moron.

679
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Tell them.

680
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,680
Yesterday he was willing to
die to save her. We've gotta
give him time to recover.

681
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,360
He might be a little vexed
that you kept letting him hump
his sister in the meantime.

682
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,880
Tell them.

683
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,080
Look, unless their dad
was also the product
of an incestuous union,

684
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,840
the chances of serious
complications are minimal.

685
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,440
Noble of you to
take that risk.
Tell them, or I will.

686
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,520
So we just need
to take these pills?

687
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,040
Twice a day.

688
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,000
Angioedema is very treatable.
You'll be fine.

689
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,520
So, what? We, like,
caught this from each other?

690
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,640
No, it's a condition
you've both always had.

691
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,720
The onset of symptoms
are sometimes caused
by stress or trauma.

692
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
The incident at the diner.

693
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,000
So we got it as kids?

694
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,520
It's a genetic disease.
It's not...

695
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,440
There's no good reason
two unrelated people
would get it.

696
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,360
We think you guys
should take a DNA test.

697
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,000
How can we be related?

698
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,120
We think you have
the same dad.

699
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,160
We won't know for sure
until we do the test.

700
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,720
Oh, God!

701
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,360
Your father.

702
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,120
No. No, this can't be true.

703
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,520
Yeah. Yeah, Jer, I'm lighter.

704
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
You know, I'm lighter
than both my parents.

705
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,920
And our eyes.
Everyone always talks about
how we have the same eyes.

706
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,160
You're not really siblings.

707
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,360
We have the same father!

708
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,200
You didn't fight in
the backseat on car trips.

709
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,240
You didn't change
each other's diapers.

710
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,920
You guys just met
and fell in love.

711
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,400
The way you feel,
that hasn't changed.

712
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,560
Hey, Foreman, can you wear
the beeper for a couple
of hours this weekend?

713
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,800
What?

714
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,560
We just destroyed
two people's lives.

715
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,320
So I'm not allowed to
run errands anymore?

716
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,080
I'd like to see some sign
that it affects you,

717
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,320
or that you recognize
it affects other people.

718
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,960
So are you going to wear
the beeper or not?

719
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,520
Sorry, I can't.

720
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
You just want to punish me.

721
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,240
I'm busy.

722
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,560
With what?

723
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,960
Going out of town.

724
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,960
Where are you going?

725
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,680
Foreman, you're not missing
a blue shoe, are you?

726
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,840
Come...

727
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,440
You can't bet
when you know
the answer beforehand.

728
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,800
We could spend all day
arguing whether you can bet

729
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,360
when you know
the answer beforehand.

730
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,600
Give me the 200 bucks.

731
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,920
What?

732
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,280
Hey.
Hey.

733
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,480
You okay?

734
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,480
I was just wondering,
do you really like jazz?

735
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,160
I love it.

736
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,800
Are you lying?

737
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,560
I'm lying.

738
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,560
I want to spend time with you.

739
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,520
Is that so terrible?

740
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,520
No.

741
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,280
Maybe we shouldn't
walk out together.
If people see us leaving...

742
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,840
Everybody's got to
find out sometime.

743
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,280
Let me just meet you
at your place.

744
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,480
She got her own room.

745
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,720
She just needs
some time alone.

746
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,640
Do you want me to
hang out here a bit?

747
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,640
If you've come to return
the thermometer, don't bother.
I've moved on.

748
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,600
If you'd actually read
my chart, you'd have
known that I'm a cop.

749
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,200
You were going 40
in a 25 zone.

750
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,880
Oh, come on.

751
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,480
This isn't because
I was speeding, this is
because I'm Latino.

752
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,720
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

753
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,160
Sorry, cool jacket.
Only pockets
for important stuff.

754
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,680
That's a shame.

755
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,000
A 50 buck ticket?

756
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,000
Is that your way of
beating me up,

757
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,200
or is that just the price
for sticking something in you?

758
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,960
You took a pill
while you were examining
a patient.

759
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,160
That's serious
addictive behavior.

760
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,200
I'm betting that
you're holding right now.

761
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,040
I wasn't weaving.
I'm not drunk.

762
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,880
You've got no reason to...
Pupils dilated.

763
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,560
Appear to be under
the influence of a narcotic.

764
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,680
Would you mind turning around,
please, and putting your hands
behind your head?

765
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,480
Does that polite crap
ever work on people?

766
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Most people realize
there's only one answer.

767
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,480
You got a prescription?

768
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,840
I'm a cripple who
works in a hospital.

769
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,800
You don't think
I can get a
valid prescription?

770
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,400
Arrogant son of a bitch
like you?

771
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,080
I'm going to bet
you didn't bother.

772
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,960
You are under arrest
for possession of narcotics.

773
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,840
You have the right
to remain silent,

774
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,360
which you should
take advantage of
for once in your life.

775
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,000
If you give up the right
to remain silent,

776
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,120
anything you say
can and will be used
against you...
