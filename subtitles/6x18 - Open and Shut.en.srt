3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,204
Tom, your husband?

4
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:36,772
What's he doing here?

5
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:46,715
Uh, what's going on?

6
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:48,117
I'm sorry, I know I'm
not supposed to be here,

7
00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:50,986
but Evelyn's school
contract's due tomorrow.

8
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,588
I knew I was forgetting something.

9
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:53,822
Let me, uh, find a pen.

10
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:59,828
Hey. Hey.

11
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:02,297
Not quite sure what Emily post
recommends in this situation,

12
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:03,499
but I'm Tom.

13
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:05,734
Damien. Hey.

14
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:08,103
Sorry to intrude.

15
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:09,738
I just--I wasn't quite sure
when she'd be coming home.

16
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:10,939
No problem.

17
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,574

19
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:18,147
Well, I'll get out of your way,

No, my stomach.

63
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,837
She put the milk in the
door and not on the shelf.

It's not a big deal.

65

You hate that she did that,

72
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:04,919

but I'm sure this

78
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,843
Interesting case.

79
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:31,379
35-year-old woman with
fever and abdominal pain.

80
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:33,881
E.R. ruled out all
the usual suspects.

81
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:35,817
Stop before you
interest me to death.

82
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:39,187
And she's in an open marriage.

83
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:41,089
That's not interesting.
It's just weird.

84
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,423
<i></i> <i>Know what's weirder?</i>

85
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,460
That other humans are
monogamous in the first place.

86
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:47,962
<i>No other species on the planet</i>
<i>mates for life</i>

87
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,430
and if you're gonna bring up swans,

88
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,065
they cheat like everybody else.

89
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,568
They just have better
pr than rabbits.

90
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,803
Animals also eat their young
and kill their rivals.

91
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,305
That make it weird
that most of us don't?

92
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:59,207
Says the guy whose
opposable thumbs have been

93
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:01,175
all over how many women
who aren't his wife?

94
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:04,512
A functional open marriage
is like a Unicorn.

95
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,214
It's a mythical creature
that doesn't exist.

96
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,815
Someone always ends up unhappy.

97
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:09,650
<i>Our patient's unhappy</i> <i>becau
se she's suffering</i>

98
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:11,586
from an intestinal blockage.

99
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:13,321
Boring.

100
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:14,889
Then we have to find a
reason to rule it out.

101
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:17,225
What about herpes colitis?

102
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,093
She picks up the infection
from one of her partners.

103
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,461
It takes root in her colon.

104
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,330
Std panel was clean.

105
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:23,731
Chances are, this couple was
unhappy in the first place.

106
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,466
<i>This is their attempt</i>
<i>to save something</i>

107
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,567
that never--

108
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:31,672
go on.

109
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,242
<i></i> <i>Herpes might not
register</i>

110
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:35,576
if she was exposed in
the last six weeks.

111
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:39,580
But it would show up
on a barium enema.

112
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:41,349
Wait.

113
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:43,751
You're gonna do it?

114
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,920
Gotta see if our
patient's a Unicorn

115
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,056
or just a slutty horse.

116
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:51,793
Think how much fun
Taub could be having.

117
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,797
Barium coats the inner
lining of your colon.

118
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:57,999
Lets us get a good look
at it on the X-ray.

119
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,201
I can get somebody
else to pick up Evelyn.

120
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:01,502
<i>I feel like</i> <i>i'm abandoning you.</i>

121
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,704
I'm on painkillers.

122
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:05,673
I'd rather this not
be what you think of

123
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,475
<i>every time you look</i> <i>at my butt.</i>

124
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:16,017
<i>Okay, roll onto your side.</i>

00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,220
It's fill 'er up time.

126
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:27,095
So is Evelyn his new squeeze?

127
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,230
She's our daughter.

128
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:30,932
<i>Must be interesting</i>

129
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,234
growing up in a production of <i>Oh!
Calcutta!</i>

130
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:34,936
She's six.

131
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:36,437
She knows as much
about our sex life

132
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:37,805
as any other kid her age.

133
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:40,875
You can explain that
she's the reason

134
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,510
the two of you stayed married.

135
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:44,412
You've been in the
room five minutes.

136
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,080
You got us all figured out.

137
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:47,715
<i>Of course,</i> <i>you left out
the part</i>

138
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,883
<i>where we love each other</i>

139
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,251
and we want to grow old together.

140
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,353
But you just don't want
to be young together.

141
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:54,122
Look, when you think about it,

142
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,857
tons of couples do what we do.

143
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,458
It's just that with most of them,

144
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:59,861
one spouse doesn't know about it.

145
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:01,462
We decided things work better

146
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,097
when people tell
each other the truth.

147
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,769
Tank's full.

148
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:12,707
I'll page the radiology elves.

149
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,278
I'm not saying I hate it.

150
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,646
Just doesn't go with your eyes.

151
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:19,780
You hate it.

152
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,482
Little bit.

153
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,950
Any more heartless critiques

154
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:24,719
of my general appearance?

155
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,120
<i></i> <i>Nope. All done.</i>

156
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:33,494
So is she as bendy as she looks?

157
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:34,495
Maya and I are just friends.

158
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:36,230
No, you and I are friends

159
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,666
and you don't have coffee
with me three times a week.

160
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,601
She's an interesting person.

161
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,637
She grew up in Ohio.
She has three brothers.

162
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:43,838
Fascinating.

163
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:45,206
Last week, that Cambodian lab tech

164
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:47,441
was telling us how he
survived the Killing Fields

165
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,477
and you left to go get a donut.

166
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:51,179
So we flirt. It's fun.

167
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:52,547
It's dangerous.

168
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,048
That woman would totally do you.

169
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,983
You think?

170
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:57,618
Nothing is gonna happen.

171
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,387
All I'm saying is if you
want to be on a diet,

172
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:03,291
you might want to stop hanging
out by the dessert cart.

173
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,526
X-ray was clean.

174
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:07,128
She doesn't have herpes colitis

175
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,663
or abdominal pain.

176
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,932
It stopped hurting
during the X-ray,

177
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,067
which means it was just an
intestinal blockage that passed.

178
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:14,735
We should discharge her.
Absolutely.

179
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:17,872
There's no need to find
any underlying cause

180
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,874
'cause these things
never happen twice.

181
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,510
Take her digestive
system for a test drive.

182
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,245
Give her a radio-opaque milkshake.

183
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:25,846
X-ray every 15 minutes to see

184
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:27,615
if it makes any unscheduled
stops on the way through.

185
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,217
We'll be here all night.

186
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:30,952
No, Taub will be here all night.

187
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,054
Talk to the Unicorn

188
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,323
and then tell me you don't believe.

189
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,024
I did an abdominal
ct on a kid today

190
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:39,293
and found a six-inch bezoar

191
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,696
made entirely of gum.

192
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:43,564
I mean, who gives a three-year-old

193
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:46,734
an endless supply of g--

194
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:50,771
you okay?

195
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,475
Yeah.

196
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:55,910
I mean, there was hair in it

197
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:58,145
and maybe a piece of paper.

198
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,418
So... how long you been married?

199
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:08,856
One of the few drawbacks
of having an open marriage.

200
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,959
Nobody ever asks me about
current events or the weather.

201
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,528
Yankees look good this season.

202
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,800
Seven years.

203
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:24,739
And, uh, how long have you-
you know?

204
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:28,376
After three years, we realized
that traditional marriage

205
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,411
was making us both miserable.

206
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:33,814
Most people get
divorced at that point.

207
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:34,982
Yeah, we didn't want
to get divorced.

208
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,417
We still loved each other.

209
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:39,954
We just realized that
expecting one person

210
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:42,890
to fulfill all of your needs
forever is unrealistic.

211
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,693
There are happy monogamous
couples out there.

212
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:47,695
<i>Sure.</i>

213
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:49,263
<i>One or two have</i> <i>the perfect marriage.</i>

214
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:52,333
<i>Everybody else has figured out</i>
<i>how to settle for less.</i>

215
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:56,771
<i>I don't want to settle and</i> <i>end
up resenting my husband.</i>

216
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:59,307
<i>I'd rather g the 10%</i>
<i>he doesn't give me</i>

217
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:03,210
<i>somewhere else so that</i> <i>i c
an really appreciate him</i>

218
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:05,680
<i>for the 90% he does.</i>

219
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:11,419
<i>I think something's wrong.</i>

220
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,420
With your stomach?

221
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,856
My heart is racing.

222
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,961
Try and take deep breaths.

223
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,432
I'm going to try to
slow your heart down.

224
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,300
Is this because of the blockage?

225
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:28,469
No. It's not working.

226
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:31,572
Need a crash cart in here!

227
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,569
<i></i> <i>I need a list of all</i> <i>your
sexual partners</i>

228
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:38,875
<i>from the last six months.</i>

229
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:41,382
Why?

230
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,125
Your wife had an arrhythmia.

231
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,361
The progression of symptoms
from bowel to heart

232
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:47,363
makes a parasitic
infection most likely.

233
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,131
Since Julia hasn't been
out of the country--

234
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,699
the only place that
I've been recently

235
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,334
is a business trip to Nebraska.

236
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,003
But either of you
could have picked up

237
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,137
a bug from one of your partners.

238
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,443
It's kind of... complicated.

239
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,046
How many partners are
we talking about?

240
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:05,347
Ballpark.

241
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,182
None.

242
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,617
None?

243
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:10,819
<i>We have a great sex life.</i>

244
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,988
I don't need anyone else.

245
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:14,723
So why not just tell her that

246
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,958
and close this whole thing up?

247
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:16,992
You married?

248
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,527
I--I was.

249
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:22,197
Did you ever agree to go see
a chick flick with your wife

250
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,600
or pretend to enjoy
classical music?

251
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,235
Stravinsky never groped my wife

252
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:27,770
in a Midtown hotel room.

253
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,938
She needs this.

254
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:32,541
I don't.

255
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,376
But I don't want her
to feel bad about that.

256
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,514
He's lying.

257
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,516
<i></i> <i>Guy's got a license to drill.</i>

258
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,084
<i>Why would he lie</i> <i>about not using it?</i>

259
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,585
That's not the lie.

260
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:46,021
The lie is that he gives a
crap about how his wife feels.

261
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,590
If they're both screwing around,
that's one thing.

262
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,726
But if she has a piece on
the side and he doesn't,

263
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,361
the only way he'd be okay with that

264
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,329
is if he's betraying
her in some other way

265
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,131
that, in his mind, makes them even.

266
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:58,400
My Unicorn isn't a Unicorn.

267
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,636
It's a donkey with a
plunger stuck to its face.

268
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:01,770
<i>Right.</i>

269
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:03,806
Even the guy who's not cheating

270
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,140
<i>is doing it</i> <i>for underhanded reasons.</i>

271
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,708
No, no, no. He's not being cynical.

272
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:08,544
He's assuming the husband
is doing something

273
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,879
to even the score,
which means he thinks

274
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:13,115
<i>there is a score,</i>
<i>which means,</i>

275
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,418
cheating swans aside,
House believes in monogamy.

276
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,020
He's being romantic.

277
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:19,822
What I believe is that men

278
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,523
are genetically
engineered to be jealous.

279
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,392
<i>Doesn't matter if</i> <i>i thi
nk there's a score.</i>

280
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,560
I guarantee you he does.

281
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,628
Any of the wife's partners pan out?

282
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:28,130
She's been with two
people other than Tom

283
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:29,798
in the last six months.

284
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:32,067
Neither of them have been
outside the tri-state area.

285
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,369
So we're back to the husband.
You just said you believed--

286
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:37,573
he's doing something
behind her back.

287
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,441
What better cover than a
business trip to Nebraska?

288
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,443
Like that's really a place.

289
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,378
Let's find his travel records

290
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,481
and get back to work.

291
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,750
You seem pretty mellow

292
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,252
about this couple's deal.

293
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,554
Thought you'd be first in
line to shake a finger.

294
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:55,958
They're still married. I'm not.

295
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,060
Not that I could ever do it.

296
00:12:58,128 --> 00:12:59,928
I was jealous of House and
Cameron never touched him.

297
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,431
Not counting the
emotional fondling.

298
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:07,302
When my mom was dying,
my dad had an affair.

299
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:11,140
He told you this?

300
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,642
I'd seen them get out of his car.

301
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,511
Two years after mom died,
they got married.

302
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:16,979
That must have sucked.

303
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,214
At the time, yeah.

304
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,217
But looking back... It makes sense.

305
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:24,353
<i>My mom never knew about it</i>

306
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,054
and he needed someone to
make him feel less alone.

307
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:27,956
<i>He took care of my mom</i>

308
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:30,292
day in and day out for 2
1/2 years before she died.

309
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,261
He was devoted to her.

310
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:35,364
Loving someone else
didn't change that.

311
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:37,666
So loving two people
at once is fine

312
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,334
as long as one of them is dying?

313
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,669
<i>Whoever's taking care of me</i>

314
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,604
when I get sick, I hope they've got

315
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:45,541
<i>someone else</i> <i>to take care of them.</i>

316
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:48,677
<i>Tom was telling the truth.</i>

317
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,013
He really did go to Nebraska.

318
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,749
Plane ticket and restaurant seats.

319
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:56,485
<i>Forget Nebraska.</i>

320
00:13:56,553 --> 00:14:01,190
Maybe they just bought their
parasites at the mall.

321
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,326
You know, we should really
throw away that loofah.

322
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:05,527
They're imported.

323
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,162
Sometimes they're not sterilized.

324
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,264
We think our patient got
amoebiasis from hers.

325
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,266
Is she gonna be okay?

326
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:13,135
We're treating now.
She should be fine.

327
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:18,040
It's actually kind of bizarre.

328
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,075
She and her husband
have an open marriage.

329
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,515
They sleep with other people?
Well, she does.

330
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,418
Her husband's totally fine with it.

331
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:34,022
I mean, it's crazy, right?

332
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,026
And you're bringing
this up because?

333
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:43,131
I thought it was interesting.

334
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,436
More interesting than
your other cases, I guess.

335
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:49,338
I mean, you talk about
your colleagues,

336
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:50,839
you rant about House.

337
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:55,444
You don't usually
mention your patients.

338
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:59,414
Is open marriage
something you want?

339
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,149
No.

340
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:04,253
I mean...

341
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,755
I know you'd never...

342
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,595
All this time and energy

343
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,265
you spent convincing me
you weren't cheating...

344
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,666
And there's somebody else.

345
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,935
I'm not-- <i>some more
water sir?</i>

346
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,950
Okay.

347
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,551
There's a woman at work.

348
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,787
People say she's attracted to me,

349
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,589
but nothing's happened.

350
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:42,724
Nothing's going to happen.
I'm not having an affair.

351
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,293
But you want to.

352
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,129
No, honey.

353
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,730
I'm trying to be honest.

354
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:51,800
I don't want to make
the same mistakes.

355
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,503
Be honest then.

356
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,438
Are you attracted to her?

357
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:04,813
Look... she's attractive.

358
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,548
There's an attraction.

359
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:08,617
Aren't there men who
make you feel that way?

360
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:11,653
Of course there are,
but it never occurs to me

361
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,790
to act on it because-
because I'm married...

362
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:17,059
To you.

363
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:20,462
And that's enough for me.

364
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,431
Aren't I enough for you?

365
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:26,968
Of course you are.

366
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:30,839
Our patient's lost all
movement in her legs.

367
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,374
There are other doctors, Chris.

368
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,343
We're talking.

369
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,045
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:40,449
The woman's paralyzed.

371
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:43,118
I'll get a cab.

372
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:57,997
Tests show no spinal cord injury,

373
00:16:58,027 --> 00:16:59,995
no cerebral lesions, no hemorrhage.

374
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:01,394
<i></i> <i>Finally got a stool sample.</i>

375
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:02,395
<i>The loofah's innocent.</i>

376
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,963
No sign of amoebas

377
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,099
<i>or any other parasites.</i>

378
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,500
So paralysis, arrhythmia,

379
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,002
and intermittent abdominal pain.

380
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,873
And he nicked himself shaving.

381
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:16,443
Sorry. That was Taub.

382
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,478
But it was easier to solve.

383
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:20,380
Means he used the crappy
razor in his locker,

384
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:22,015
which means he slept here.

385
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,818
Thanks to you.

386
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:28,288
I brought up open
marriage with Rachel.

387
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:30,957
It was a disaster.

388
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,627
On the medical front,

389
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:36,663
we've knocked out sex
and foreign travel.

390
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,665
Could be an electrolyte imbalance.

391
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:40,567
So the only time you're not
interested in my marriage

392
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:41,734
is after you bw it up?

393
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:43,102
You're the moron who
took marital advice

394
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,237
from Tila Tequila.

395
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:45,472
You pushed me into this.

396
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,307
Figured it would either
blow up your marriage

397
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:48,741
or make it more honest.

398
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:49,876
<i>Either way, you win.</i>

399
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,312
What about sex?

400
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:53,379
I'm talking about the patient.

401
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,447
Is that cool with everybody?

402
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,483
We've ruled out sex.

403
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,084
We ruled out sex with other people.

404
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:00,420
Tom said he and Julia
have been doing it

405
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,622
<i>three or four times a week and</i> <i>she
's got boys on the side.</i>

406
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,190
Increased libido can be a symptom

407
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:06,159
of adrenocortical carcinoma,

408
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:07,894
which also explains
her other symptoms.

409
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,631
A woman who likes sex must be sick?

410
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:12,999
<i></i> <i>Just because everybody</i>
<i>in this room</i>

411
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,568
wishes that all women
were horny all the time

412
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,338
doesn't make it so.

413
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:19,672
Get an mri of her adrenal glands.

414
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:31,017
Hi.

415
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:32,785
Okay if I take the sports page?

416
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:34,687
Sure.

417
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,895
Would you mind using a coaster?

418
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:43,062
Oh.

419
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,931
Sure.

420
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,132
Sorry.

421
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,767
It's okay.

422
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,173
<i>Also, it'd be great</i>
<i>if you'd replace</i>

423
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:56,609
the toilet paper when
you finish a roll.

424
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,077
<i>And when you load</i> <i>the dishwasher,</i>

425
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:00,713
you can't put a big,
flat bowl on the bottom.

426
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:03,950
It traps the water so nothing
on the top gets clean.

427
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,219
And please don't throw banana
peels in the bedroom trash.

428
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:09,556
I haven't done any of those things.

429
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:10,723
You're probably not even aware of--

430
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,725
I hate bananas.

431
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:20,433
Oh, my God. It was House.

432
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,869
I'm sorry.

433
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:24,504
He's been trying
to get us to fight.

434
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:27,507
Why would he think that
stuff would make us fight?

435
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:28,708
Because of the milk.

436
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,944
You put it in the door.

437
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:34,480
The body of the refrigerator
is the coldest part.

438
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,715
The temperature in
the door fluctuates,

439
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,283
which decreases shelf life.

440
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:38,451
Wow.

441
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,953
When did you get all ocd?

442
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,956
I just want clean dishes
and unspoiled milk

443
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:44,557
so we can all stay healthy.

444
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,994
Oh, it's about health.
What about the coaster?

445
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,598
Does that replenish
my B-12 or something?

446
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:52,699
Can we just drop it?

447
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:54,601
Sure.

448
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,211
You have this list of annoyances

449
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,381
<i>the entire time</i> <i>we were married?</i>

450
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:10,650
Get better, mommy.

451
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:12,518
I love you, rabbit.

452
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:16,856
Julia, you have a guest.

453
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:22,328
Hi.

454
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:23,630
This isn't a good time.

455
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:25,531
<i>Dr. Hadley, did you say</i>

456
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,400
there was a video
game in the playroom?

457
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:30,837
Maybe you can teach me
how to play one of them.

458
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,171
See you in radiology.

459
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,945
Get out of my wife's room.

460
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:40,747
<i>Your relationship with her</i> <i>sta
ys out of our space.</i>

461
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:42,949
I was worried about her.

462
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:45,018
Tom's right. You should go.

463
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:48,888
So it's fine if we have sex,

464
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,089
but if I drop by to
see if you're okay--

465
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:52,091
this is our family.

466
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,697
Sorry.

467
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:08,074
I spent two years of residency

468
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,810
wearing shirts that
were a size too small.

469
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:13,046
How hard is it to ask me not
to put them in the dryer?

470
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:14,981
And I only did your laundry
because you were never home.

471
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,083
I didn't ask you to.
Of course you didn't.

472
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,552
You just got annoyed whenever
you didn't have clean underwear.

473
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,653
I never said I was annoyed.

474
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:22,155
That's the point.

475
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:23,656
You didn't say anything.

476
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:25,725
So I'm getting a lecture
on communication

477
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:27,794
from someone who had
her lawyer inform me

478
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:28,928
our marriage was over.

479
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:33,666
Asking for an open marriage.

480
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,802
You got stones.

481
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,804
Conversation sort
of got away from me.

482
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:39,472
It was a train wreck.

483
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,541
I think it's good
you brought it up.

484
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:43,876
I read a study that found
men who have multiple copies

485
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:45,344
of a certain vasopressin receptor

486
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,613
are twice as likely
to be unfaithful.

487
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,449
Maybe you're just
one of those guys.

488
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:53,086
So my cheating is
biologically predetermined?

489
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:54,320
Fantastic.

490
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:55,421
Multiply times five.

491
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:56,389
We need a better
look at the medulla.

492
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:57,623
I thought you'd be relieved.

493
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,858
This gets you off the hook.

494
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:00,326
It's just genetics.

495
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:01,961
I'm 5'6" and have a
receding hairline.

496
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,362
I hate genetics.

497
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,897
Medulla's clean.

498
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:06,299
I don't see you wearing
lifts or hair plugs.

499
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,400
That's because being short and bald

500
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:08,768
doesn't hurt anybody.

501
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:10,470
The only thing hurtful
about your other

502
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,939
genetic predisposition is
that you keep denying it.

503
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:15,575
It's not good for you or Rachel.

504
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:18,144
There's nothing there.
It's not adrenal cancer.

505
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,980
And maybe you're right about me.

506
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,248
But I'm not gonna stop trying.

507
00:22:22,316 --> 00:22:23,516
Rachel's worth it.

508
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,418
Look up there.

509
00:22:25,486 --> 00:22:26,486
The lung.

510
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,688
What is that?

511
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:30,423
You served me with divorce papers

512
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:32,658
in the middle of a medical
conference in New Orleans.

513
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,460
I threw a bottle into
an antique mirror.

514
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:35,928
Oh, you exhibited an emotion?

515
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:37,363
I wish I'd known you were capable.

516
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:38,598
I loved you.

517
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:39,699
I thought I was gonna
be following you

518
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,067
to Baltimore, remember?

519
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:43,002
I called about apartments.
I set up interviews.

520
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,871
How could you think that we
still had a real marriage?

521
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:46,773
We hadn't had a
conversation in months.

522
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,041
Maybe because I was working
two jobs to support us.

523
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,309
No! No!

524
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:51,644
It's because when you were home,

525
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:52,812
it was like talking
to a block of ice.

526
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,380
You were obviously
so pissed off at me.

527
00:22:54,448 --> 00:22:55,948
I was killing myself
so that you could take

528
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:57,383
that non-paying internship.

529
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:58,851
That you said that I should take.

530
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,919
I was trying to be supportive!

531
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:01,220
Why do I have to be the bad guy?

532
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:03,623
Expressing yourself does
not make you the bad guy.

533
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,491
Okay, then. You were
being a selfish bitch.

534
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:11,330
VQ scan confirmed the spot
on Julia's lung was a clot.

535
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:13,733
Think there's a chance
the husband's a plushie?

536
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:15,134
If he has a secret,

537
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:17,670
I highly doubt it's more
relevant than the clot.

538
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,839
Clotting disorder would
explain everything.

539
00:23:19,907 --> 00:23:21,774
<i>Question is, which one?</i>

540
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:24,877
Do you read any of your
departmental memos?

541
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,913
Only the ones labeled, "n-s-f-w."

542
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,081
Accounting notified
you two days ago

543
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:30,950
about your patient's insurance.

544
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:32,852
Sorry, that's "n-n-s-f-w."

545
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,321
Here. He doesn't have any.

546
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:37,023
Try not to bankrupt them.

547
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,658
Oh, I'm long past the
number of procedures

548
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,493
that'll bankrupt them.

549
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:41,627
Julia's got insurance.

550
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:42,862
I saw the policy
number on the form.

551
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,363
But the policy lapsed
due to non-payment.

552
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:46,566
I already made three
calls about this.

553
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,835
You should have been aware of that.

554
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,174
No, there's just a mistake.

555
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:57,977
Of course we have health insurance.

556
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:02,315
We're actually a little
behind on the premiums.

557
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:04,116
<i>But I pulled money</i>

558
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:05,351
<i>out of my retirementccount</i> <i>to cover it.</i>

559
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:07,019
They said that we'll be fine in--

560
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:09,055
Why the retirement account?

561
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,226
We'll just give you
a few minutes to--

562
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,829
and by "we," she means "she."

563
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:22,668
I lost all of our savings.

564
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,708
Sounds like a secret to me.

565
00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:33,729
I started her on heparin to prevent

566
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:35,798
further clots, but we still
don't know what's going on.

567
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,767
Of course the husband's
secret was money.

568
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:40,069
If it's not sex, it's always money.

569
00:24:40,137 --> 00:24:42,238
Unless it's sex for money.

570
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:43,806
How did he lose it anyway?

571
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:46,509
It's not medically relevant.
You're not gonna care.

572
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:47,843
Wilson's been teaching
me how to care. Try me.

573
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:49,879
He builds wind turbines

574
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:50,980
and leases them out to
local power companies.

575
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:51,981
You're right. I don't care.

576
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,916
Clotting disorder: Dic.

577
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:57,386
Factor five leiden,
antiphospholipid syndrome.

578
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,854
Vitamin k deficiency also fits.

579
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:02,191
Causes thrombophilia and is
consistent with abdominal pain.

580
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:04,527
Congratulations, House.
Sam ended it.

581
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:05,895
What happened?

582
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,296
Go test our patient's blood.

583
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:09,699
But it can wait five minutes.

584
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:11,901
For everything we discussed.

585
00:25:17,674 --> 00:25:19,141
I'm sorry.

586
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:22,545
Well, at least you're
actually taking responsibility

587
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,113
<i>for once in your life.</i>

588
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:26,816
Sorry that she left.
It's not my fault.

589
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:28,084
<i>I didn't even want</i>

590
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,185
to get involved.

591
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:30,853
You dragged it out of me.

592
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:33,089
What about the
dishwasher and the banana

593
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,690
<i>and the toi--</i>

594
00:25:34,758 --> 00:25:37,426
she left because of the banana.

595
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,662
I just wanted you to
stand up for yourself.

596
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,464
<i>Tell her what you want.</i>

597
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:43,966
If doing that causes
her to walk out

598
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:45,134
<i>for the second time,</i>
<i>well, your relationship</i>

599
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:46,769
wasn't gonna last anyway.

600
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,704
Or you could have stayed out of it.

601
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:50,172
<i>I could have kept</i> <i>my mouth shut,</i>

602
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,141
been annoyed sometimes,
but I'd be happy,

603
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:54,243
because I'd still be with her.

604
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:57,179
Now all I have is cold milk.

605
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:58,881
<i>As long as you're free,</i>

606
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:02,218
you want to grab some dinner?

607
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:07,423
Did Tom go home for the night?

608
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:09,558
For starters.

609
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:12,962
I told him to leave.
I don't want him here.

610
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,332
Money is a complicated subject.

611
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,034
Yeah, it's not the money.

612
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:20,936
I mean, the-
the money's bad, but...

613
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,308
When we first opened our marriage,

614
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,879
I got involved with a guy
who lied about being single.

615
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:32,615
Then one day, his wife calls me.

616
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:37,319
She's crying and screaming
and totally out of control.

617
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:41,290
And I felt...

618
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:43,392
superior.

619
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,128
I thought I don't ever have to
worry about feeling this way

620
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:49,198
because Tom and I are
honest with each other.

621
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:55,337
Well, here I am.

622
00:27:01,545 --> 00:27:03,179
Hi.

623
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:08,050
Sorry I didn't make
it home last night.

624
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:10,086
I needed to run some tests.

625
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:13,155
You know what the worst part was?

626
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:18,327
When y had your affair...

627
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:20,563
Wasn't the sex.

628
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,966
It was the lies.

629
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:26,836
Realizing that the
narrative of my life

630
00:27:26,903 --> 00:27:29,472
was totally wrong.

631
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:31,340
You weren't stuck in surgery.

632
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:34,376
You weren't out of town.

633
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,780
I don't want to go
through that again.

634
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:39,882
I told you nothing's--

635
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,619
Thursday nights.

636
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:46,822
You have to be home by midnight.

637
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,457
You don't bring her here.

638
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:51,727
<i>You don't talk</i> <i>to h
er about me</i>

639
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,231
and I don't want to meet
her ever in any context.

640
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:05,474
Are you giving me permission
to sleep with other women?

641
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,510
It's what you want, isn't it?

642
00:28:07,577 --> 00:28:10,646
I want you.

643
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:13,816
You want more than me.

644
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:16,585
You want that thrill.

645
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,824
But I love you.

646
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:24,794
And I really believe
that you love me...

647
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:26,695
And we have a good life together.

648
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:28,664
<i>And at this point,</i>

649
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:32,668
either I walk away
or I try to accept

650
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:34,870
who you really are.

651
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:38,707
Tomorrow's Thursday.

652
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:41,377
Yes, it is.

653
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:49,151
All our tests came back negative.

654
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:51,253
It's not a clotting disorder.

655
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:53,923
Which means we need to
come up with a better idea.

656
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,661
So what causes problems in
the stomach, heart, nerves?

657
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:01,096
Oh, my God.

658
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,668
You know what it is?

659
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:13,876
Taub's wife gave the green
light for an open marriage.

660
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:15,477
<i>He's wearing cologne,</i>

661
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,479
but not the stink of shame.

662
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,582
<i>You got a date.</i>

663
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:21,750
I am going out with Maya tonight

664
00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:24,787
with Rachel's blessing.

665
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:27,957
Mazel Tov?

666
00:29:28,024 --> 00:29:31,193
Maybe the problem isn't her blood.

667
00:29:31,261 --> 00:29:32,628
Maybe it's the vessels
carrying the blood.

668
00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:35,364
No sign of schistocytes
or hemolysis.

669
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:37,399
So you're actually going
to sleep with another woman

670
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:38,968
then go home to your wife?

671
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,369
<i>Thank God someone's</i>

672
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:41,971
keeping us focused on
what's really important.

673
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:44,473
Taub was gonna do
all of that anyway.

674
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:46,275
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.

675
00:29:46,343 --> 00:29:49,044
Imaging showed normal diameter
in her pulmonary artery.

676
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:52,181
<i>Here's a thought--</i>

677
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,683
Taub's wife is now
totally on the market.

678
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,485
Mind hitting me with her digits?

679
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:03,259
She would love that,
but duty calls.

680
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:10,432
What's the matter?

681
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,734
My stomach.

682
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:12,835
Same pain as before?

683
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:14,403
Yeah, but worse.

684
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:16,005
Get the portable
ultrasound in here.

685
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:17,640
We need to get a look at her belly.

686
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:19,675
Help me!

687
00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:27,085
Pain, pain went away,

688
00:30:27,153 --> 00:30:29,154
came back another day.

689
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:31,723
Question is, what brought it back?

690
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,092
Physical exam was unrevealing.
Ultrasound was clean.

691
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,093
So afterwards, are you gonna shower

692
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:36,594
at your girlfriend's or at home?

693
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:38,396
Patient. Abdominal pain.

694
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:39,664
Yeah, he's right.

695
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:41,499
Let's get this wrapped
up before 6:00.

696
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:45,136
Taub turns back into a
faithful Pumpkin at midnight.

697
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:47,405
Patient was out with her
boy toy before she came in.

698
00:30:47,473 --> 00:30:49,374
Maybe the pain was triggered
by sexual excitement.

699
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:51,810
Because lying alone
in a hospital bed

700
00:30:51,877 --> 00:30:53,645
contemplating bankruptcy-- hot.

701
00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:56,281
My point was that
arousal is a function

702
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:58,283
of the parasympathetic
nervous system.

703
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,751
<i>If that's where</i> <i>the problem is,</i>

704
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:01,486
<i>the pain could be triggered</i> <i>by crying,
which seems--</i>

705
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:03,254
pns. Also controls digestion,

706
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:04,689
which she's been doing without
screaming her head off

707
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:06,424
<i>since she's been here.</i>

708
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:08,493
What if what matters isn't
when the pain started,

709
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:10,094
<i>but when it stopped?</i>
It was during an X-ray.

710
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,530
You think that cured her?

711
00:31:12,598 --> 00:31:14,599
No, but House prepped her for
the X-ray with a barium enema.

712
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:17,836
Well, that wouldn't
treat anything except--

713
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,505
go.

714
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:22,073
You're in pain because
part of your intestine

715
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,341
folded in on itself.

716
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:24,442
It's called an intussusception.

717
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,910
It's cutting off blood flow.

718
00:31:25,978 --> 00:31:27,946
We need to fix it before your
bowel gets necrotic and dies.

719
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,414
Once you do that,
will I get better?

720
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:30,615
When this happens in adults,

721
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:32,283
it's usually a sign
of abdominal cancer.

722
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:33,485
We'll fix the overlap,

723
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:35,253
and then search your
intestine for tumors.

724
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,794
Foam?

725
00:31:44,597 --> 00:31:48,032
I have a bad feeling about this.

726
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,801
A friend can't spontaneously buy

727
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:51,102
<i>an overpriced</i> <i>itali
an espresso machine</i>

728
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,838
for another friend?

729
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:55,607
What did you do?

730
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:57,609
Nothing. That's the beauty.

731
00:31:57,676 --> 00:32:00,078
I genuinely tried to help Wilson.

732
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:01,746
I told him to stand up for himself,

733
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:03,548
which you know is
legitimate advice.

734
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:04,949
And his relationship blew up.

735
00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:06,618
Is he okay?

736
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:07,752
Ah, he'll be fine.

737
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,254
Point is, I realized something.

738
00:32:09,321 --> 00:32:12,023
I do nice things,
nice things happen to me.

739
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:13,391
Karma works.

740
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:15,793
So you're paying it forward?

741
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:19,397
If this should somehow
lead to Lucas dying

742
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:22,166
or oral sex,

743
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:24,102
so be it.

744
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:25,169
Namaste.

745
00:32:33,612 --> 00:32:35,780
Think I should wear a tie tonight?

746
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:37,248
This isn't weird at all.

747
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:41,686
I mean, where's
Rachel eating tonight?

748
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:43,855
<i>Home.</i>

749
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:45,456
What if she's going out too?

750
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:50,295
She is allowed to, right?

751
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:52,697
Of course. It's only fair.

752
00:32:52,765 --> 00:32:54,165
But I don't think she will.

753
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,967
Your wife only eats dinner at home?

754
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,139
If she did go out,

755
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:02,941
that would be tough,

756
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:05,043
<i>but I think</i> <i>i can handle it.</i>

757
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,744
Don't do it unless you're sure.

758
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:09,247
I know I'd rather be
jealous than a liar.

759
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:11,382
Got something here.

760
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,651
Kelly clamp and scalpel.

761
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,753
Biopsy showed
non-specific inflammation,

762
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:17,355
which suggests ibd,

763
00:33:17,423 --> 00:33:19,524
only it doesn't explain
the cardiac problems.

764
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:21,492
Or her declining kidney function.

765
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,761
We ran panels during surgery.

766
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:27,699
Actually, ibd does make sense,

767
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:30,401
'cause it could trigger
ankylosing spondylitis,

768
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,570
which would explain the
heart and the kidneys.

769
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:35,840
Start her on sulfasalazine
and tnf-inhibitors.

770
00:33:35,908 --> 00:33:37,542
Oh, and Taub,

771
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,378
I'm not gonna see you before
you head off for gomorrah.

772
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:42,313
Just remember,
if you get disoriented...

773
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:46,451
Breathe through your nose
and look for the horizon.

774
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:04,035
I can't.

775
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:06,971
I really thought I could do this.

776
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:12,510
Logically, it makes perfect sense.

777
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:15,613
But...

778
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:18,282
all afternoon,

779
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,654
all I kept thinking about
was the two of you,

780
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:24,889
together,

781
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:26,424
and you touching her.

782
00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:29,527
Nothing's happened.

783
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:31,129
It's okay.

784
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:33,064
I'm sorry.

785
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:35,133
'Cause I really wanted it--

786
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,901
no.

787
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,903
I've been an idiot,

788
00:34:38,971 --> 00:34:40,238
and I don't need anything else.

789
00:34:40,305 --> 00:34:42,306
I just need you.

790
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,809
You mean that?

791
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:47,078
I do.

792
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:53,751
I love you, Rachel.

793
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:54,819
I love you too.

794
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:56,788
Let's go home.

795
00:34:56,855 --> 00:34:58,156
Is that okay?

796
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:01,292
There are other doctors.

797
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,834
<i></i> <i>The treatment's not working.</i>

798
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,102

799
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,336

800
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,705
It's not ankylosing spondylitis.

801
00:35:16,773 --> 00:35:19,108
Kidney biopsy showed she
had iga nephropathy,

802
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:20,643
which could be caused by

803
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,078
or associated with any
of these conditions.

804
00:35:23,146 --> 00:35:25,414
We've gone from too
few ideas to too many,

805
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:27,983
and our patient's
running out of time.

806
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:30,920
Why the lack of afterglow?

807
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:33,289
Physio girl not as
freaky as you'd hoped?

808
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:35,391
I went home with my wife.

809
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:37,827
After all that,

810
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:39,195
you chickened out.

811
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,998
I can't hurt Rachel like that.

812
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:45,835
Sickle cell anemia would
have shown on blood tests.

813

00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:56,645

817
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,047

819
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,284

Well, everything left on the list.

831
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:24,573
The list was not created equal.

832
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,242

no, you were right.

868
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:11,981
I was selfish back then.

Those are lilacs.

893
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:36,432
My mom used to grow lilacs.

894
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,501
My dad made her get rid of them,

895
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:41,603
'cause there were too many bees.

896
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,373
<i>We ruled out hsp</i>

897
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:46,408
<i>'cause there was no inciting</i>
<i>respiratory infection.</i>

898
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:49,278
But in rare cases, it can also
be triggered by a bee sting.

899
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,681
We also ruled it out
because there's no rash.

900
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,416
Maybe we just didn't see it.

901
00:40:00,423 --> 00:40:02,958
Have you been stung
by a bee recently?

902
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,694
Uh, about a month ago.

903
00:40:07,831 --> 00:40:09,331
What's going on?

904
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:13,268
I think your wife has
henoch-schonlein purpura.

905
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:15,637
<i>Systemic vasculitis</i>
<i>can cause</i>

906
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,740
lesions and inflammations
throughout the body.

907
00:40:18,808 --> 00:40:21,176
It's pretty awful,

908
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:23,011
which explains why it was
named after a German.

909
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:25,047
Actually two germans.

910
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:27,983
<i>Lesions can pop up</i> <i>in the heart,</i>

911
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,286
sometimes in the kidneys,
but always on the skin.

912
00:40:31,354 --> 00:40:33,122
Means you'd have a rash somewhere.

913
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:34,690
I don't.

914
00:40:34,757 --> 00:40:36,058
<i>Not that you know of.</i>

915
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:41,163
Okay, I'm gonna have
to check your holes.

916
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,698
I'll start with the mouth.
If there's nothing there,

917
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:44,733
then things might
have to get kinky.

918
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:46,001
Say aah.

919
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,704
Aah.

920
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:50,706
I was kinda hoping for kinky.

921
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:52,574
Is that good or bad?

922
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:54,276
<i>We'll treat her</i>

923
00:40:54,344 --> 00:40:56,345
with high-dose ivig
and cyclophosphamide.

924
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,947
<i>You should be fine.</i>

925
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:01,216
I'm gonna be okay.

926
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:06,955
I love you.

927
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:08,390
That is adorable.

928
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:11,593
Other than you still wanting
to have sex with other dudes,

929
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:13,762
and him bankrupting your family,

930
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,931
I think you kids are
pretty much home free.

931
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:24,273
Mm-hmm?

932
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,176
And...

933
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:28,343
You two made up?

934
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:30,179
No.

935
00:41:30,246 --> 00:41:32,347
You can thank me later.

936
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:34,883
I'm all-in.

937
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:38,754
