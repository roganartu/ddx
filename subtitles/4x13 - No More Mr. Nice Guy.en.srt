1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,500
Whoever thought walking
in a circle at two miles an hour

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,500
would be draining?

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,700
Fresh air, exercise.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,300
You know, some things
do have their negative sides.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,400
Our income just 
got cut in half.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,100
And we get to spend twice 
as much time together.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,200
More, if you don't leave
before your lunch hour's over.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,200
Out of my way.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,700
We have a legal right
to hold you up for 15 seconds.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,700
15...

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,100
- 14,
- One.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,400
11,

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,700
10,

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,500
Just trying to do
my job.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,200
Hey, relax, three more seconds,
and you can go.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,800
Are you telling me
what to do?

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,300
It's okay.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,700
Just take a breath.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,000
Get the hell off me.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
I think it's been 15.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,900
You okay?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,300
Oh, my God, Jeff!

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:17,000
House M.D.
Season 4 Episode 13
"No More Mr. Nice Guy"

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Paging Dr. Spencer.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,300
Paging Dr. Statham,
Dr. Statham, please.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
This place is a mess.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
Welcome to a world
without nurses.

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
Here, you can start
with these.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,900
It's not my fault.

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
I didn't lose nurses.

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,500
Cuddy was looking for you.

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,600
Said she'd send you
down here.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
I know, that's why I'm here.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,400
Because cuddy hasn't 
found you yet.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,300
She's gonna look everywhere

38
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,600
except the place
she wants me to be.

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,900
Hey.

40
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,500
I've got an aortic 
dissection here.

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,700
What's with the idiot?

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,600
Fainting spell and recent
history of dysgeusia.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Everything tastes
like lemon meringue pie.

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,800
You want to take him?

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,700
No.

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,000
Sir.

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,600
Why do you have two 
lunches in front of you?

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,100
Been here for two meals.

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
And you're happy with that?

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
No, I just don't see 
much use in complaining.

51
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Seriously?

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,900
It's a very useful tool.

53
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,000
Complain, you make 
people miserable.

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
They do what you want
to make the misery go away.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
You probably should say something.

56
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,900
Maybe I can call one
of the doctors I work with-

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,300
They're doing their best.

58
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,500
What the hell?

59
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm sure it was an accident.

60
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,000
Is he Canadian?

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
Uh, he's a low priority...

62
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,800
Is that a yes?

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
He's just-
Happy.

64
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,400
I gotta stop this
before it spreads.

65
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,800
You guys are done.

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,600
This could be
a metabolic disorder,

67
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,100
toxic exposure,

68
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,000
carcinoma of the tongue
metastasized the brain,

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,100
epilepsy, M.S.

70
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,300
Or it could be the flu,

71
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,500
and we should all be
back in the E.R.

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
No, you're ignoring

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,900
The big symptom.

74
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,300
What if we're looking at both
the flu and decent parenting?

75
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,600
Okay, you two are 
perfectly healthy.

76
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,200
This guy wasn't pandering.

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,500
He wasn't vanilla nice.

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,900
He was nice without any aspiration,

79
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,000
personal gain.

80
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,600
I'm thinking genetic defect.

81
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,200
Niceness is a defect?

82
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,700
Three cavemen see a stranger

83
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
running towards them with a spear.

84
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
One fights, one flees,

85
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,900
One smiles and invites him over

86
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,800
for fondue.

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,100
That last guy didn't last
long enough to procreate.

88
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,100
And how long has the 
patient been suffering?

89
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,600
At least as long as his 
wife has known him.

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,400
11 years.

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,500
The chances of him having
an undiagnosed pathology

92
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,100
- for that long-
- What are you saying?

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,500
That evolution is wrong?

94
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,100
Where do you think we are,
21st-century America?

95
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,800
He's saying that statistics

96
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
are true too.

97
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,300
The world is a bell curve.

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,600
Most of us fall within 
the standard deviation,

99
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
but there are outliers,

100
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,300
and if we believe
in the existence

101
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,100
of extreme jerkiness, which 
I suspect that we do...

102
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,100
then we also have to accept
the existence

103
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,400
of the opposite extreme.

104
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,000
You want it to be a symptom

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
because then we're 
supposed to be jerks,

106
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,100
which means you don't even
have to try to be nice.

107
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,100
Okay.

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,400
Maybe I'm biased.

109
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,400
Let's take a vote.

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,000
Who thinks that niceness
is not a symptom?

111
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,700
And who thinks

112
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,600
that their vote counts?

113
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,300
You two, check out 
his home for toxins.

114
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,400
- Taub and Thirty-One...
- Thirty-One?

115
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,900
Oh, I'm sorry,

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,200
I thought that either way
was good with you.

117
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Taub and Thirteen,

118
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,500
MRI for tumors and 
EEG or nerve damage.

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,700
Test whatever comes out of him
for everything else.

120
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,200
Too much axis tilt.

121
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,600
Don't release until your thumb's
at the bottom of the ball.

122
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,400
I assume Wilson was busy.

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Again.

124
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,300
No axis tilt.

125
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,200
With Amber?

126
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,300
Again.

127
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,000
Still, it was nice 
of you to invite me.

128
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,200
This is fun.

129
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,200
No, it wasn't.

130
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,400
No, it isn't.

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I didn't invite 
you to be nice.

132
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
I invited you because bowling
isn't one of the two things

133
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
guys do by themselves.

134
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
What's the second thing?

135
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,600
Other hand.

136
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
If people are incapable

137
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
of being nice, why 
bother having the word?

138
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
The ontological proof

139
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,500
of niceness.

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,100
The existence of the word
proves the existence

141
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,200
of the concept.

142
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,300
Look out for those minotaurs
on your drive home.

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,900
And I thought motives
didn't matter.

144
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,100
Only results mattered.

145
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,500
So what are you gonna do

146
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,000
to screw up Wilson's relationship

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
so you don't have to listen
to me while you bowl?

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,300
I wish the best for them

149
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,900
and their tragically 
deformed children.

150
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,300
Well, she's good at being bad.

151
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,500
You might not be able
to destroy her.

152
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,000
As long as I give 
it my best shot.

153
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm gonna hold my head high.

154
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,900
Cameron had this one 
insufferable friend.

155
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,000
She wasn't gonna 
get rid of her,

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and I sure wasn't 
gonna join 'em.

157
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,000
So I just said,
"See her on Thursdays."

158
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,300
I know it's not as exciting
as an exploding birthday cake,

159
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,900
but, hell,

160
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
I don't want to hang out
with her every night anyway.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
That's amazing.

162
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,100
Cameron only has one 
insufferable friend?

163
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
Joint custody.

164
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,200
Of Wilson?

165
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Unless we have another love child.

166
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
Deal with him.

167
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,900
He needs a mother figure.

168
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,100
I'm not saying you're not entitled

169
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,100
to spend time with him.

170
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,900
I'm just saying I'm entitled too.

171
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,400
I don't know how 
to deal with him

172
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
when he's being reasonable.

173
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
This is reasonable?

174
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,500
This is crazy.

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,500
You're not a child.

176
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,900
You can make your own plans.

177
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
No, crazy is

178
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,100
what House would normally do
in this situation-

179
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,200
Swap your lubricant
with superglue.

180
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
The man knows me.

181
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,900
This is his way

182
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
of accepting us.

183
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,700
It's actually a 
very touching moment.

184
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm proposing I get
every other day

185
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,300
and every other weekend.

186
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
I have yoga Wednesdays.

187
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
You can have him then.

188
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,100
But you have to have him
home by 11:00.

189
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,700
We can swap weekends.

190
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,100
Mondays and Wednesdays,
and midnight.

191
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
If he's not home
till midnight,

192
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
we won't be asleep
till almost 2:00.

193
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,400
Wilson, make a ruling.

194
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,800
No.

195
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,300
You two are like dogs

196
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,000
circling each other
in the park.

197
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,200
And I say that with all 
the love in the world.

198
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,600
You need to sniff
each other's butts,

199
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,300
bare your teeth, and arrive
at some strange detente.

200
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,500
Otherwise, you'll end up
biting each other's eyes out.

201
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,200
Again, with all the love
in the world.

202
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
I'll let you sniff first.

203
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,100
Take my deal, or 
get out of my apartment.

204
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,400
Take my deal, or I move in.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This guy worked for 
Habitat For Humanity

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
In Costa Rica.

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,700
And coaches handicapped kids.

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,800
You think we should do a work-up

209
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
on the other coaches?

210
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,400
It is possible 
he's too perfect.

211
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,700
I'm not saying he's perfect.

212
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm saying he's trying to be.

213
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
That's what people do.

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,100
What?

215
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,700
That's not what people do.

216
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
People usually suck,
but they want to be good,

217
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
- want to be nice.
- House?

218
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,700
Exception that proves the rule.

219
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,700
What sort of argument is that?

220
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
A bad one.

221
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
That might be relevant.

222
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
Hydrofluoric acid.

223
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,000
lowers his calcium,

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,900
causes the fainting
and taste issue.

225
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,300
But not the niceness.

226
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,500
Wouldn't that be nice?

227
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,300
You are King Solomon.

228
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,900
If you want us to cut him
in half, we're cool with that.

229
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,300
My boyfriend's too 
much of a wuss

230
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,400
to make the call for himself-
And I mean that

231
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,500
with all the love
in the world.

232
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700
I'm gonna piss off
one of them,

233
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,800
and they both scare me.

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,900
"Your treatment of patients

235
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,100
is reprehensible."

236
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,200
You're reading his 
performance review?

237
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,900
I'm busy.

238
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,500
We have a nurses' strike.

239
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,100
"Your management of employees

240
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,300
borders on abuse."

241
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Let's go.

242
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,500
No, why-

243
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,400
I want to hear it.

244
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
"You are overtly contemptuous

245
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,700
of hospital hierarchy."

246
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,700
And covertly.

247
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,100
I suppose you didn't 
know about that.

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,800
"Your attitude towards
supervisory personnel

249
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,900
"is disrespectful,

250
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,200
"and a disturbingly large
proportion of your comments

251
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,400
are racist or sexist."

252
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,300
That top makes you look
like an Afghani prostitute.

253
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,600
Would be an example of that.

254
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Sign this.

255
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,100
House.

256
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,500
- I got the-
- It can wait.

257
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,300
I will sign, if you 
will give us a ruling.

258
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,600
I will give you a ruling,

259
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,500
if you do the reviews
on your team.

260
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,700
I'd be happy to continue
the mockery of this process.

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,800
What'd you offer him?

262
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,800
- Wednesdays till 11:00 and alternate weekends.
- Wednesdays till 11:00 and alternate weekends.

263
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Yes.

264
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,300
Wednesday nights are 
ladies' nights at Cheetah's.

265
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,200
Calcium's normal.

266
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
- Wow.
- It really could wait.

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,900
Everything's normal.

268
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,800
And you thought
it wouldn't be.

269
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
He's a carpet cleaner.

270
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
He's got a home full 
of hydrofluoric acid.

271
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,100
That doesn't mean his 
calcium should be low.

272
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,400
Yeah, it actually kinda does.
HF causes lower levels of-

273
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,800
Lower, not low.

274
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,400
- Lower than normal.
- Lower than yesterday.

275
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Yesterday might have been high.

276
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,600
What's lower than high?

277
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,200
He actually has hypercalcemia,

278
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
which is being lowered 
to normal by the HF.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
So what gives us
elevated calcium,

280
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
bad taste, and fainting?

281
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
I take it you know?

282
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,100
Get the team.

283
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,100
This is gonna be fun.

284
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,000
Hello, again.

285
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,700
These people think
you are not too nice.

286
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,600
Too nice?

287
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,000
For what?

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
For life as we know it

289
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,900
to have evolved without 
an intelligent designer.

290
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,300
I'm going to 
prove them wrong.

291
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Your wife is very ugly.

292
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,300
Get out of here.

293
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Deb.

294
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
He's obviously trying
to prove a point.

295
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,500
I think I just did.

296
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
You're either perfect
or you're sick.

297
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,000
In my experience, sick 
is much more common.

298
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,000
He's not sick.

299
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
He's nice.

300
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,500
Nice in the sense
that your toaster is nice

301
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,100
for making you breakfast.

302
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
It's the only thing his wiring

303
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,000
will let him do.

304
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,700
He has Williams syndrome.

305
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,500
Your husband is 
missing the genes

306
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,700
that make him suspicious.

307
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
You're wrong.

308
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,900
- He's
- Relax, there's no cure.

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,400
He's gonna go right on
tasting lemon meringue pie,

310
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Fainting, and being a sap.

311
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,100
What about the other symptoms?

312
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,600
He has no other symptoms.

313
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,900
But williams does.

314
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,500
He's got teeth,

315
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,300
glasses.

316
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,000
Williams cuts I.Q. by 20-

317
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He doesn't work in 
the physics department.

318
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Except when they spill
a black hole on their carpet.

319
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,700
Elfin appearance?

320
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Yeah, he's more Legolas
than Keebler,

321
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,600
but I bet you he can still crack
off a batch of pecan sandies.

322
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,600
Perfect pitch?

323
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,700
You love to karaoke, right?

324
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,900
I suck.

325
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,900
Modest.

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,100
- Another symptom.
- No, he really

327
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,300
does suck.

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Give us a warble.

329
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
You know any Cher?

330
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,200
No.

331
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,500
But I know Bread.

332
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
What's the matter?

333
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,200
He's stroking.

334
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,600
And a moment too soon.

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,200
You were wrong.

336
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,900
Why do people say that
with such pleasure?

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
It's very hurtful, you know.

338
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
It means the patient gets
to keep being nice.

339
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Why does that offend you?

340
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,700
It's the way he said it.

341
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,600
He wasn't relieved,
he was excited.

342
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,600
He was also wrong.

343
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,000
And I say that with 
no sense of pleasure.

344
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
Patient tested negative
for Williams,

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,100
which means the stroke and
everything else wasn't caused-

346
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,000
You have a friendly demeanor,

347
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
but you sometimes get too involved.

348
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,000
You relate well to your 
peers and patients.

349
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,800
And you complete tasks

350
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,300
in a timely manner.

351
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,800
Please sign.

352
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,100
What the hell was that?

353
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,500
I have to give each of you
performance reviews.

354
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
Plenty of other conditions

355
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,000
can cause debilitating niceness.

356
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,900
How is that supposed to help him?

357
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't know.

358
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,500
How's it supposed
to help Wilson?

359
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Cross out Wilson's name
and the date,

360
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,300
and then fill in your own name.

361
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,400
The point of a review

362
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,100
is to give feedback to help.

363
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,900
I'm thinking neurosyphilis.

364
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,000
Wouldn't show up on the MRI

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,300
without contrast.

366
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I'll go run the tests.

367
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,100
He doesn't think
it's syphilis,

368
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
but he's gonna go run
those tests anyway.

369
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,200
Because he doesn't know.

370
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,600
That's why we do tests.

371
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,700
Because he's a wimp.

372
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,200
Because he's afraid of you.

373
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,000
You want me to intimidate him
into not being afraid?

374
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,300
Not sure I know how to do that.

375
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Reviews make a difference.

376
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,100
People have to listen,
so they have to learn.

377
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,300
I don't think that the right time

378
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,000
to tell the dog not 
to pee on the rug

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,300
is semi-annually.

380
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,700
You don't want to 
do the paperwork.

381
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,300
I am concerned
about the rainforest.

382
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,600
I'll do it.

383
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,900
I know.

384
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,200
I don't have syphilis.

385
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,200
You don't know.

386
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,300
How many ways are 
there to get it?

387
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,200
You can know who 
you had sex with.

388
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
- You can't know who she-
- I do.

389
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,500
Not for sure.

390
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,300
It's a waste of time.

391
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,900
I had a stroke.

392
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,800
You can't keep wasting time.

393
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,900
We were tested for 
the peace corps.

394
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,100
Ten years ago.

395
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,700
You haven't been with your wife
every minute of every day.

396
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
You think I'm naive, don't you?

397
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,800
I think you're... yeah.

398
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,300
I know my wife.

399
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,600
She's not perfect.

400
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,100
I'm not perfect.

401
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,400
But she loves me.

402
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,700
And she's always loved me.

403
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Every minute, every day.

404
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
You're 15 minutes late.

405
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
Have you heard the good news?

406
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,600
Miley Cyrus is playing

407
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,900
a third night at the Spectrum?

408
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Happiness is possible.

409
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,800
And not just in this life,
but in the next-

410
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,700
Oh, you're selling religion.

411
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm sorry, I bought 
some Islam yesterday.

412
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,200
Well, it's where your light
shows signs before mending-

413
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,500
Have a good evening.

414
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,600
You're late.

415
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
15 minutes.

416
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
16 minutes, my 16 minutes.

417
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
So keep him an extra 16 minutes.

418
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
- You hear that?
- She doesn't care.

419
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,100
- You're going mini-golfing.
- What's it matter?

420
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
You got a tee off time?

421
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,300
It matters because you don't get

422
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,500
to decide what matters.

423
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,800
It was my fault.
I had to take a shower.

424
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,500
Which was my fault.

425
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,300
I had to take a dump.

426
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,900
Anything else

427
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,200
I don't need to know
before you leave?

428
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,500
Have fun on your playdate.

429
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,100
You've got mommy's numbers,
right?

430
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,600
Daddy needs a drink.

431
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,700
I was thinking, if we discount
the niceness issue-

432
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,800
Sit down.

433
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,700
I think it's a heart defect.

434
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,900
Nothing on the echo.

435
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,200
Could be a patent foramen ovale.

436
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
It explains the stroke,

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,800
and the syncope, and 
a PFO wouldn't show up

438
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
on a routine echo.

439
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,600
I'm gonna do a bubble test.

440
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,900
You got a minute first?

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,800
Sure.

442
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,500
I think you've shown
remarkable strength

443
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,600
in a difficult situation.

444
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,700
Are you giving me
a performance review?

445
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,000
A good one.

446
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm gonna do a bubble test.

447
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,700
There was enough 
blood left over

448
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,900
from his admission work-up
to run the VDRL.

449
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,000
You doubted your patient.

450
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,100
No, what I thought didn't matter.

451
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,800
House said he wouldn't 
let us go on

452
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,200
until we ruled out
neurosyphilis.

453
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,300
It's not neurosyphilis;
it's a PFO.

454
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,900
It's neurosyphilis.

455
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,700
The tests were positive.

456
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,800
It's always the same conversation.

457
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,000
They tell you you 
must be mistaken,

458
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,400
which is why I always run
the tests twice,

459
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,500
and then they blame
the other guy,

460
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,200
which makes sense
if they're innocent,

461
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,800
but obviously,
half of 'em aren't.

462
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,200
They don't seem to get
that they're busted.

463
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,900
Scientifically proven.

464
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,800
Unless your spouse cheated too.

465
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,500
Exactly.

466
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,000
That's what you're praying 
for in that moment.

467
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,900
That she cheated too.

468
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
And then if she doesn't kill
you, you know that she did.

469
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,400
You know she betrayed you.

470
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,500
And then, you realize
that that sucks worse.

471
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,300
The test must be wrong.

472
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,600
I ran it twice.

473
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,600
Not that test.

474
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,800
The one I took ten years ago.

475
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,800
What other explanation is there?

476
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,600
He really sees no 
other possibility.

477
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Did you have an affair?

478
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,300
No.

479
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,900
Then why aren't you 
angry with him?

480
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,000
You ever know anybody
who's just too nice?

481
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,000
No.

482
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,800
It's annoying-
Then you realize

483
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,300
it's annoying because they
remind you of what you are not.

484
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,400
That you'll never be
as good as they are.

485
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
And then you think,
why can't I?

486
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
And before you know it,

487
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,200
that naive idiot you laughed at

488
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
has made you a better person.

489
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,100
You really think

490
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,200
I've been in love all these 
years with a symptom?

491
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
If syphilis caused
lesions in his brain,

492
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,700
and the lesions caused
personality changes,

493
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,000
you may notice a change in him
as his condition improves.

494
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,200
I know my husband.
He's not gonna change.

495
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,600
You should get 
yourself tested.

496
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,400
So much for the bell curve.

497
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,200
How can House be an ass
without it being an illness,

498
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,700
but niceness is a 
biological crime?

499
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,800
You got five bucks?

500
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Uh, yeah.

501
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
Niceness just cost 
you five bucks.

502
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Being an ass generally 
turns a profit.

503
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,500
Kutner, could you excuse us?

504
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,300
I need to do Taub's review.

505
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,800
You can stay.

506
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,000
I think it would be better
if this was done privately.

507
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,400
This isn't gonna be done.

508
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,300
What is it with you guys?

509
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,600
I've given you advice before.

510
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,800
Not as our boss.

511
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,100
What's the difference?
Advice is advice.

512
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,200
Fair enough.
I'll go first.

513
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,100
You demonstrate a 
great air of confidence,

514
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,600
which is really
pissing me off.

515
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,300
House authorized me-

516
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
- How long have you known him?
- He's using you.

517
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,400
I volunteered because 
I knew he wouldn't.

518
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,600
He could care less
about the paperwork.

519
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,500
He's using you to 
screw with you.

520
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,900
He knows it'll annoy us.

521
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,800
We'll stand up to you,

522
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,300
which will force you
to confront the fact

523
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,800
that even though you think
you're our superior,

524
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,000
you're no different from us.

525
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,400
He gave you authority

526
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,500
to keep you in your place.

527
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,800
It's true.

528
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Thanks.

529
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,100
Not him, what'd he say?

530
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,500
Nothing, what's true?

531
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,100
There's something
wrong with this guy,

532
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,000
it means there's something 
wrong with House.

533
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
Are you trying
to get me drunk?

534
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,200
What time is it?

535
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
10:30.

536
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,300
Ooh. She'll kill you.

537
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
I'll get you home
before lights out.

538
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,600
Great.

539
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,100
Then she'll kill me.

540
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,700
If I get-
If I get any more drunk,

541
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,400
then I'm-

542
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,500
it...

543
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
might not work.

544
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,000
If you, uh, know what I mean.

545
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
Really?

546
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,600
You'd think that one or more
of your ex-wives

547
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,100
would have mentioned 
that to me.

548
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,800
They told you?

549
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,600
Wait.

550
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,100
Why do you want to get
Amber angry?

551
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,700
Because I'm your friend.

552
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,300
No, no, no.

553
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,800
You said you approved,
you said you were taking-

554
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
the high road.

555
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,400
For how long, the first exit?

556
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,900
Hello, and thank you
for saving me

557
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,500
from being righteoused
to death.

558
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,000
Patient's vomiting blood.

559
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,200
Hematemesis could indicate-

560
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,900
Don't put it on the board.

561
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
You don't think it's a symptom?

562
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
I think it's my marker.

563
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,900
He has syph.

564
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,500
And what?

565
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,900
And syph, it can 
cause hematemesis.

566
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,600
Not everyone agrees.

567
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,400
How-
How could you-

568
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,600
You wouldn't have woken me up
in the middle of the night.

569
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,500
If it was just syph,
he wouldn't be getting worse.

570
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,700
He's already on penicillin.

571
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,500
Bleeding's probably

572
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,000
from liver damage,
probably caused by ethanol

573
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,100
in the cleansers
or the penicillin.

574
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,700
Two more probablys
than I like to hear.

575
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Liver tests and serologies
are gonna take a full day.

576
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,200
Full night, actually.

577
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Guy not might make 
it to brunch.

578
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,300
Yes, I knew about your 
issue with alcohol.

579
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,900
Yes, I intentionally

580
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,600
got you drunk to provoke an
argument between you and Amber.

581
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,900
Why I would do such a thing

582
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,300
is an interesting question.

583
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,500
What's more interesting

584
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,400
is that you knew
as much as I did

585
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,800
and you're the one who's 
pouring down the drinks.

586
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,300
Why?

587
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,200
Because I thought I was out
having fun with a friend.

588
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,900
I didn't know the 
drinks had subtext.

589
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,200
I gotta get home.

590
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,200
GGT's normal.

591
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,500
Rules out alcohol.

592
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,000
How about serum protein?

593
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,400
It's positive.

594
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,200
Kinda assumed he had protein.

595
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,300
It's how much protein 
he has we care about.

596
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,900
It's positive for syphilis.

597
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,800
You mind if I give you
a performance review?

598
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,700
Not the patient.

599
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,100
House.

600
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,600
He has syphilis.

601
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,900
What happened?

602
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,600
Every time I searched my soul...

603
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,400
I found Anna.

604
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,400
Are you gonna tell Marie?

605
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,700
I have to.

606
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,900
It will destroy her.

607
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,900
Could it be any worse on her

608
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
yhan loving somebody
who can't love them back?

609
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,300
Yes?

610
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You might want to 
turn off the TV.

611
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,800
Don't you think I know that?
I'm multi-tasking.

612
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,400
Also doing my taxes.

613
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,800
And Cuddy.

614
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,100
What'd you find out?

615
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
The patient has hepatitis.

616
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,500
I assume from your omission
of the word 'viral'

617
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,300
before the hep that 
it's not another STD.

618
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,100
Put him on steroids
and test him for sarcoid

619
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,300
before the liver failure
becomes liver failed.

620
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,700
We're all doing this.

621
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,800
There's more?

622
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,800
You have syphilis.

623
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,300
No, I don't.

624
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,300
One of us found a vial
of your blood in the lab-

625
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,800
Which one of you?

626
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,500
It's treatable.

627
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
We filled a prescription.

628
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,000
You okay?

629
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,300
So this is why he 
is who he is.

630
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,400
We don't know.

631
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,200
We know.

632
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,100
It's not just a coincidence.

633
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,800
Wilson says he's always been a jerk.

634
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,100
But he got worse.

635
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,200
After his leg.

636
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,100
The leg was a coincidence.

637
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,600
Did you sleep with him?

638
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,800
So what's gonna happen?

639
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,100
What's gonna change?

640
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,500
Maybe he'll be less
of a jerk.

641
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
Or less of a doctor.

642
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,600
You gotta be a jerk
to be a good doctor?

643
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,300
I don't know.
Maybe House does.

644
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,000
Why aren't you answering me?

645
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Because it's none
of their business.

646
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,600
It's none of your business.

647
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,800
I think the STD
makes it my business.

648
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,500
Humans are complicated.

649
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,800
Humans are simple.

650
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
A million different things

651
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,600
make us who we are.

652
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,800
You change one,
you change everything.

653
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,100
If Mozart was better adjusted,

654
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
decides to play catch one day,

655
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,300
maybe there's no Magic Flute.

656
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
You did, didn't you?

657
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,000
There's something
I need to tell you.

658
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,000
You returned him drunk.

659
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,800
On time.

660
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,100
Drunk.
On time.

661
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,800
No tag backs.

662
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,300
The purpose of the time
was to give me time.

663
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,500
So you didn't have sex?

664
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,400
I like sex.

665
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,600
Then you can have it tonight.

666
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,300
The l word is on.

667
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,200
You don't get to 
decide what matters.

668
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,500
Either you're genuinely afraid

669
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,300
I'm gonna make him miserable,

670
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,600
Or you're afraid I'm 
gonna make him happy,

671
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
or you simply can't 
stop screwing

672
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,800
with anything that moves-
It doesn't really matter

673
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,500
because whatever the reason,
you'll only get worse.

674
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Until either I stop 
seeing wilson,

675
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,000
or I stop you.

676
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
What do you think
I'm gonna choose?

677
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,900
If you terminate
the agreement,

678
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,400
it's not gonna bring peace
in the Mideast.

679
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,600
I'm not terminating
the agreement.

680
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,700
I'm amending the agreement.

681
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm adding penaltylaus c.

682
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Fine.

683
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,000
Whoever violates it
gets their finger cut off.

684
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,800
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

685
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,000
You want people to drive safer,

686
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
take out the airbags

687
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,400
and attach a machete
pointing at their neck.

688
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,700
No one will drive over 
three miles per hour.

689
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,200
- I'm not cutting-
- We'll figure it out.

690
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,600
On your time.

691
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,800
You know she's 
certifiable, right?

692
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,900
I got the forms in my desk.

693
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Where is she wrong?

694
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,300
What were you gonna tell me?

695
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,900
Nothing.

696
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,900
You're punishing me?

697
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,800
I needed to tell you 
something privately.

698
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm not gonna tell her.

699
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,200
You'll tell her.

700
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,500
She's your girlfriend.

701
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,900
You should tell her.
You're my friend.

702
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,300
It's not the same.

703
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Don't sulk.

704
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,400
Where am I wrong?

705
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,900
Your management style
is counterproductive.

706
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
You gave me authority
over the team,

707
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,700
just so they could undercut-

708
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,800
Critiquing the clap-addled?

709
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,000
That's sort of tasteless.

710
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I didn't feel like waiting
until your genitals cleared up.

711
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You need to formalize

712
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,400
my authority over the team.

713
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,600
No, I don't.

714
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
You don't think I'm qualified?

715
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,300
Compared to those three?

716
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,200
You wanna punish Cuddy
for hiring me without-

717
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,500
I like Cuddy.

718
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,300
I like parts of her.

719
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You wanna crush the 
team by crushing me?

720
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,800
I want to empower them.

721
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Those three idiots
need to respect you.

722
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,300
They should respect you.

723
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,000
They should be 
afraid of you.

724
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
So I have to humiliate you.

725
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
'Cause if the team fears you,

726
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,700
they won't question you;
if they don't question you,

727
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,800
they won't get any answers;
if they don't get any answers,

728
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,000
they're useless.

729
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,500
Mocking me saves lives?

730
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,400
The hospital will probably
build you a statue one day.

731
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,600
You know, with a "kick me" 
sign on the back.

732
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
So when you think about it,

733
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,300
the more I mock you,

734
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,100
the more it shows I 
have respect for you.

735
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,500
Or you made up that BS 
because you like humiliating me.

736
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
Wouldn't rule that 
out completely.

737
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,800
- You busy?
- Almost done.

738
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,000
Uh, so just remember,
the rabbit goes around the tree

739
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,600
and jumps down the hole.

740
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,300
Negative for sarcoidosis.

741
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,700
Run him for everything
you can think of.

742
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,900
Lepto, schisto, hemo,

743
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,900
and the fourth Marx Brother
nobody ever heard of.

744
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,200
You bitch!

745
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,900
I just went to get us some lunch,

746
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,700
you were asleep.

747
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,400
You moved my book.

748
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,300
Jeff.

749
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,200
Calm down.

750
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,300
It's just the drugs.

751
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,400
The drugs didn't move my book-

752
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,900
Jeff?

753
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,500
My husband's having a heart attack-
Can somebody help me,

754
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,700
please?

755
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,700
Somebody help me,

756
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,000
Please!

757
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,700
She saved his life.

758
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,100
Or she scabbed.

759
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,900
Depends on your point of view.

760
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,600
So what do we think?

761
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
New symptom?

762
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,700
Or just a wife beater?

763
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,800
Hey.

764
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,000
Time for you to take
this baby for a spin.

765
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,300
We, uh, loaded him
full of prednisone

766
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,800
to try to fix the liver.

767
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,000
Good news is, he's running out
of organs to fail.

768
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,900
Prednisone could cause

769
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,500
'Roid rage, which could cause
hypertension,

770
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,200
Which results
- 'Roid rage after six hours?

771
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,000
At that rate, by sundown,
he'll have eaten most of us.

772
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,900
Uh, it still could be
penicillin.

773
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,800
Allergic reaction.

774
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,200
How does a fried liver
put him into a rage?

775
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,800
It's not frying his liver,
it's frying his syphilis.

776
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,000
The penicillin's working.

777
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,500
The real patient is emerging,

778
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,200
so syphilis prevents
domestic violence.

779
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,700
I'm gonna be more 
attractive to the ladies.

780
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,000
I was gonna test
for a heart issue

781
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,200
before the syphilis.

782
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,700
PFO could explain
the heart attack

783
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,400
and reduced blood flow to the
brain could explain the rage.

784
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,400
Well, all good ideas.

785
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,900
Okay,let's take a vote.

786
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,200
How many think
it's the 'roids talking?

787
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
And who's for the penicillin?

788
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And how about

789
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
whatever she said?

790
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,800
Someone hasn't 
raised their hand.

791
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,000
Whatever I decide?

792
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,000
You're setting me up.

793
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,400
Why would I do that?

794
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,600
PFO.

795
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,100
The PFOs have it.

796
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,900
I just hope the bubble 
test is positive.

797
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,800
Or it's no more
Mr. Nice guy.

798
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,700
We gave Van Gogh
chelation therapy.

799
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,500
Turned him into a house painter.

800
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,400
Maybe not.

801
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,800
Maybe we just

802
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,900
put Hitler on ritalin.

803
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,300
Are you comparing 
House to Hitler?

804
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,600
Oh God.

805
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,700
Just because I don't 
think he's Hitler

806
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,600
doesn't mean I slept with him.

807
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,700
I don't sleep with everyone
who's better than Hitler.

808
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,400
Maybe Taub is right.

809
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,100
Maybe this is good.

810
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,400
This is not good.

811
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,500
Well, he respected
our opinions,

812
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,600
he mocked himself,

813
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,300
he was civil, he shared.

814
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,800
He didn't care.

815
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,900
He never cares.

816
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,400
He didn't vote.

817
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
He always cared about one thing.

818
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,900
Solving the puzzle.

819
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,800
But he was irrelevant
to that diagnosis.

820
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
He had no opinion of his own.

821
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,400
He now cares about nothing.

822
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,600
You had no choice;
you had to treat him.

823
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,700
What's done is done.

824
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,700
You know that thing
I was gonna tell you,

825
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,900
I gotta tell you.

826
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,000
I gotta tell someone.

827
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,100
You've got to swear
not to tell C.B.

828
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,100
Whatever.

829
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,000
Well, that's not swearing,
that's shrugging.

830
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,800
It's actually the opposite
of swearing.

831
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,100
I won't tell Amber.

832
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,000
My team thinks
that I have syphilis.

833
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,300
Do you?

834
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,500
Not yet.

835
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,900
Why do they think you do?

836
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,700
Because I knew

837
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,500
that they had access
to an old blood sample,

838
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,800
and I knew they'd test it
sometime for something.

839
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,200
Why would you swap your blood?

840
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,300
What are you afraid
they'll find?

841
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,700
Shut up,
you're missing the point.

842
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,800
Now, they think
that I'm on penicillin.

843
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,100
Is this some clever 
practical joke

844
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,800
that I'm not aware of?

845
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,000
And as I get better,
I get nicer.

846
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,100
That's brilliant.

847
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,500
Foreman thinks I actually 
value his opinion.

848
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,900
Thank God he said PFO, or I'd
have had to do some dancing.

849
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,900
You got time for bowling?

850
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,300
Come on, it's work hours.

851
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,400
I'll get my shoes.

852
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,800
- So we don't need to talk about
- No.

853
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,700
- You're gonna keep screwing-
- Yeah.

854
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,600
You're gonna keep 
talking about it.

855
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,900
We are who we are.

856
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,600
I'll get my shoes.

857
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,800
Okay, got a good view
of the heart.

858
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,500
What if we lower
House's dosage?

859
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,900
Maybe stabilize him,

860
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,800
he doesn't get worse,

861
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,900
he doesn't get better.

862
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,000
Quite the line to walk.

863
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,300
If we're wrong, he 
dies of neurosyphilis.

864
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,900
If we don't, other people die.

865
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,100
Other people who 
aren't our boss.

866
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,000
People.

867
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,600
This sucks.

868
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,500
The guy had a gift.
I'd kill-

869
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,100
Hi, what-

870
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,900
House doesn't have syphilis.

871
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,600
He switched the blood samples.

872
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,600
How do you know that?

873
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,800
House told Wilson.
I wanted to ruin House's day.

874
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,300
See ya.

875
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
We're idiots.

876
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,800
We're not idiots.

877
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,500
Positive blood test means
positive blood test.

878
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,000
Apparently not.

879
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,800
There they are,
let's see if they-

880
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,100
Uh, what are you doing?
We're not done.

881
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,700
He doesn't have syphilis.

882
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,900
I know.

883
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,900
Patient tested positive
for syphilis, right?

884
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,400
Is this some sort of recap?

885
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,800
But why did he test positive

886
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
for syphilis?

887
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,500
Oh, I know this.

888
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,900
Either one: he has syphilis-

889
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,700
I was gonna say that.

890
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,200
Or two: the test
was wrong twice,

891
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,900
or three, he gave us
someone else's blood.

892
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,800
Who?

893
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,000
Amber.

894
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,400
Get that idiotic smile

895
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,800
out of my face.

896
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,700
I gotta go on a killing spree.

897
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,600
Or, four, he has something that
tests positive for syphilis.

898
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,700
It's not Chagas.

899
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,000
He worked in Costa Rica
before he was married.

900
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,700
Is two a spree, or do I 
have to kill you too?

901
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
Chagas wouldn't explain
the niceness.

902
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,800
I've heard of remote tribes
that actually practice

903
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,300
acts of kindness.

904
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,900
Or the Chagas caused
encephalitis.

905
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,200
The MRI showed no sign-

906
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,600
Until we started him
on steroids,

907
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
compromised the immune system,

908
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
and let the infection flare up.

909
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,900
I did another one.

910
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,900
It's not much.

911
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,400
It's plenty.

912
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,200
You figured this out
because I don't have syphilis?

913
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,900
Damn.

914
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,400
That should have been
my epiphany.

915
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,700
Good news, bad news.

916
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,300
Good news is

917
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,600
we know what you have,

918
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,700
it's treatable, you're gonna live.

919
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,400
Really?

920
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,200
What's the bad news?

921
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,200
The cure is a grueling 
course of pills.

922
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,900
It's like one a day
for a month.

923
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,300
Now you're just trying 
to make me laugh.

924
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,300
Yeah, like that's a challenge.

925
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,100
You have Chagas disease.

926
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,300
It's a parasite.

927
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,300
It's been asymptomatic
for ten years.

928
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,000
Not quite.

929
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,300
- Your brain's been swollen-
- Not enough to see,

930
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
but enough to alter
your personality.

931
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
Now we're back to that.

932
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,400
He screamed at you.

933
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,800
You don't think he could change?

934
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,600
That was because of the drugs.

935
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,900
So you think drugs are more
powerful than parasites?

936
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,900
I mean, 

937
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,900
the ones we're gonna give you to treat
the parasites obviously are-

938
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,900
I stand by the principle.

939
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,900
I'm not worried.

940
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,700
Neither am I.

941
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,200
Neither am I.

942
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,900
But that's because
I don't care.

943
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Reviews?

944
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,100
It was brought to my attention

945
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,600
that on occasion,
I am not respectful

946
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
of hospital hierarchy.

947
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,900
The word was "contemptuous."

948
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,500
Well-phrased, thoughtful.

949
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,900
Identically phrased.

950
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,800
These are all the same.

951
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,900
Because, underneath it all,
we are all the same.

952
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
And Foreman refused
to type his up.

953
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Well, it's more
than I expected.

954
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,600
There's an extra one in there.

955
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,100
"Your treatment of patients
is non-existent

956
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,900
because you're not a doctor,
you're an administrator."

957
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,100
Foreman convinced me
that these could be helpful.

958
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,000
"Your management of employees

959
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,100
is, well, let's face it,
they're outside carrying signs."

960
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,600
The strike ended.

961
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,700
The nurses have been back
for two shifts already.

962
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,100
You'd think I'd have noticed.

963
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,200
What exactly did they do
around here?

964
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,600
"You act like employees

965
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,600
"should fear and respect you,
but your eyes tell us-

966
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,600
"but your eyes tell us nothing

967
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,200
"because we're looking
at your boobs,

968
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,400
"which tell us that 
you're desperate

969
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,500
"to have someone jump on you
and tell you they love you

970
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,000
"one grunted syllable
at a time.

971
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,600
"What you want,
you run away from.

972
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,400
"What you need,

973
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,700
"you don't have a clue.

974
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,800
"What you've accomplished,
makes you proud.

975
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,300
But you're still miserable."

976
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,600
Please sign.

977
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
I got a call
from Amber today.

978
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,500
Says there's been a 
violation of your contract.

979
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,600
You've been seeing 
Wilson on her time.

980
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,100
She breached confidentiality.

981
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,900
You can let it slide,
officer.

982
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,200
We're even.

983
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,100
Yes, you are.

984
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
You're both losing fingers.

985
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,600
Look what I found.

986
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,000
Nice.

987
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
They think you might be able
to come home tomorrow.

988
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Oh, yeah?
That's good.

989
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,000
What's the matter?

990
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,300
The ketchup.

991
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,500
There's something wrong
with that.

992
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,500
Tastes fine.

993
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
Anything else?

994
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,700
Everything else is great.

995
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,700
I'm just-
I don't know.

996
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I guess I don't like
ketchup anymore.

997
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,500
Wonder what else
I don't like.

998
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,900
Roll over.

999
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,900
We need a tougher punishment.

1000
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,600
Come over to the poopy side.

1001
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,000
Where are you two 
going Friday night?

1002
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,100
Dinner at L'Auberge.

1003
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,000
You're lying.

1004
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,500
Of course I am.
