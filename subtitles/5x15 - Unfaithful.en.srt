1
00:00:04,056 --> 00:00:05,651
It's okay, Eileen.
I got this.

2
00:00:05,776 --> 00:00:07,553
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. You get home.

3
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:09,446
Thanks, Danny.
See you in the morning.

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:10,760
I'll be here.

5
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:34,909
Food's gone, Daryl.
We're closed.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,683
You wouldn't happen to have an
extra coat in there, would you?

7
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:40,706
- You're wearing a coat.
- A winter coat, man. It's cold.

8
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:42,636
Come on.

9
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:52,634
Here.

10
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:56,560
Rangers?

11
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:59,102
You expect me to
wear this in Jersey?

12
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,686
Come on, man,
where's your sense of humor?

13
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,535
Good night, Daryl.

14
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:45,900
Go away.

15
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,888
That's not funny, freak.

16
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,395
No one is laughing, Daniel.

17
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,777
House - Season 05 Episode 15
"Unfaithful"

18
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,118
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak

19
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:58,177
www.house-fr.com

20
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,543
You doing anything Friday?

21
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:06,239
Taking a lovely young lady
to the philharmonic.

22
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:08,551
That your way of saying
you're having sex with a hooker?

23
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:11,816
Two. Can't create a harmonic
with just one.

24
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,005
Well, I was hoping you might available
for Rachel's Simchat bat. It's a...

25
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,091
Jewish baby-naming ceremony,

26
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:20,846
a time-honored tradition dating
all the way back to the 1960s.

27
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:22,648
My house at 7:00.

28
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:26,560
It'll just be the Rabbi
and a few friends and some family.

29
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,545
Nothing like welcoming
a baby into the world

30
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,914
with a completely naked
display of hypocrisy.

31
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,612
There'll be plenty of wine

32
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:35,214
and nice people
you can quietly mock.

33
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,816
Wish I could, but I already
put down a deposit

34
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:39,385
on 16 crates of jell-o.

35
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:44,849
It's one evening.
I'd like you to be there.

36
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,683
Religious hokum, get sponge bath.

37
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,867
Can I get back to you?

38
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,463
Can I help you?

39
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:05,140
Just browsing. Thanks.

40
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:08,352
Happy to be underachieving again?

41
00:04:08,743 --> 00:04:11,000
Running the E.R.
is slacker heaven.

42
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:14,157
- Looking for anything in particular?
- Not anymore.

43
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:16,297
- Where's this guy?
- Why?

44
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,027
'Cause he's my next patient.

45
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:20,045
It'd be rude of me
not to introduce myself.

46
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,464
He's a drunk priest
who hallucinated Jesus.

47
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,805
- Afraid you might've missed something?
- Afraid you're everyone's time?

48
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,410
It's obviously either alcohol
or exhaustion.

49
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:31,292
So you admit you have no idea which?

50
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:35,066
I admit that I'm too busy to
care who you're screwing with.

51
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:41,880
Don't thank me. Just knowing
I can be of assistance is thanks enough.

52
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:48,746
You went out of your way
to pick him?

53
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,790
- This is nothing.
- There are no small cases.

54
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:53,834
Any guesses
where this joke is going?

55
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:57,963
- Could be psychomotor epilepsy...
- Could be alcohol.

56
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:00,301
Shouldn't we let the E.R.
rule the obvious out...

57
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,701
Could be atropine toxicity,
occipital lobe tumor.

58
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:04,761
You're not telling us something
about this case?

59
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,389
- Why would you think that?
- 'Cause you want to screw with us.

60
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,600
Or screw with
a hallucinating priest.

61
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:12,416
Both are possible.
There's only one way to find out.

62
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,105
Run an E.E.G. for epilepsy.
C.T. his brain for tumors.

63
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:18,174
Go check his House of God
for toxins.

64
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:21,028
Fourteen, hold up.

65
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:25,846
This department is broken,

66
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:28,975
And I'm not gonna take a real case
until it's fixed.

67
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,229
Job or relationship... your choice.

68
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,388
What?

69
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:37,745
To put it in terms
you might better understand,

70
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,922
If you don't split, you must quit.

71
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:43,008
The drug trial is over.
I'm out, she's out.

72
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:45,302
- Don't care.
- We're adults. We can handle this.

73
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:48,263
- You just have to give us a chance.
- No, you're not. No, you can't.

74
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:49,590
And no, I don't.

75
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:53,852
Mull it over. You got until
the end of this fake case to decide.

76
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,513
I wasn't drunk.

77
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,691
I had one or two drinks.

78
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:04,977
People often underestimate
alcohol's effect on their...

79
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,323
I was on my way to six.

80
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,910
I know how alcohol affects me.
This wasn't the alcohol.

81
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,974
You lived in Manhattan for 3 years.

82
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,956
Then a year in Oregon,
18 months in new Mexico,

83
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:16,792
less than a year in Wisconsin,
and now you've been living in Trenton

84
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,365
for the last 6 months.

85
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,378
Yep.

86
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,372
The more we know about you,
the more likely it is we can help you.

87
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,414
It's not medically relevant, so...

88
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,304
No way to know unless
you went to medical school.

89
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,742
Four years ago, a teen
in a youth group at my church

90
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,772
accused me of inappropriate contact.

91
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,364
I was innocent,
but the church decided to transfer me.

92
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:43,525
Said it would be easier
for all involved.

93
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,321
When the parishioners
at the new church got wind of why

94
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,633
I'd been transferred, they were...

95
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:50,231
unhappy

96
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:53,266
I was sent off again and again,

97
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:56,081
and how is any of that
medically relevant?

98
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:58,814
So the kid lied?

99
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:01,420
He was confused.

100
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,173
Confused whether
you molested him or not?

101
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:07,573
Okay, you wanted to know why
I moved around so much and I told you.

102
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,558
How about telling me
why I was hallucinating?

103
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:11,847
Syphilis could explain
the hallucination.

104
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,016
I'm not sexually active.

105
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:16,813
You don't have to admit
you did anything with the kid.

106
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,696
- You weren't always a priest.
- I wanted to be since I was 12.

107
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:22,191
I entered the seminary
when I was 17.

108
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,569
Maybe it wasn't a hallucination.
Maybe it really was Jesus.

109
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,447
- I'm not insane.
- Seeing Jesus makes you insane?

110
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,938
A bit of an odd attitude
coming from a priest.

111
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:34,440
Well, it's just a job now.
The fairy tale ended a long time ago.

112
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:40,272
You're a wuss, part wimp, part puss.

113
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,875
I have no choice.
I'm part of the ceremony.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,378
I thought you were
already circumcised.

115
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:47,591
It's one night for a friend.

116
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,465
What about the friend
who has two tickets

117
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,217
to see Brubeck at the blue note?

118
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:53,552
- I thought you had an orgy planned.
- I lied.

119
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,349
Are you lying about the tickets?

120
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:58,049
Yes, but only to save you
from yourself.

121
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:01,494
I'll be fine and so will Cuddy
if you don't show up.

122
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,913
I'm surprised she even invited you.

123
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:06,273
It is oddly flattering.

124
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,906
God, I'm so sick
of his stupid stunts.

125
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:12,362
Everybody has to put up
with their boss's stupid stunts.

126
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:15,401
No, they don't. There's H.R.,
there's Cuddy, there's other jobs.

127
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:16,954
House doesn't listen to H.R.

128
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,809
Cuddy will let him fire us
before she fires him, and

129
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,461
I don't want another job.

130
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,583
Why do you cling to him?
Why do you defend him?

131
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,213
Because I don't want to be unemployed
doesn't mean I'm codependent.

132
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,300
I'm not saying you're codependent.
I'm saying you're scared.

133
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:35,961
You know what?

134
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,171
You're right.

135
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:41,542
- So you want to quit?
- No,

136
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:44,064
No, I want to stop a stupid stunt.

137
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:47,464
House doesn't want either
one of us to quit. He wants this.

138
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,238
He's got two lab rats in a maze
and thrown in one piece of cheese.

139
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:58,217
So what do we do?

140
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:00,622
Nothing.

141
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,157
- Cool.
- It's cool he's a child molester?

142
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:07,409
It's cool the priest
doesn't believe in God.

143
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,895
It's cool that God did to him
what he did to the kid.

144
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,171
Allegedly.

145
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:13,782
- You think he's innocent?
- He had honest eyes?

146
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:16,771
You think he's guilty, which explains
why you're dying to discharge him.

147
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:19,585
I'm dying discharge him`cause he's
not sick, not `cause he's a pedophile.

148
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,352
- Allegedly.
- You believe the kid got confused?

149
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:25,231
If everybody lies,
that includes teenage boys.

150
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:27,813
Aren't we lucky to have
such an interesting patient?

151
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,656
Had, there's nothing wrong with him.

152
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:32,423
The world's most boring case
just became a page turner.

153
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:35,394
- You want to tear out the last chapter?
- You want to examine his character,

154
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,547
go to a soup kitchen.
We are done testing him

155
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,161
for things he doesn't have.

156
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,594
Bad news for Foreman and Thirteen.

157
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:46,556
- Case is over.
- We're not splitting up.

158
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:50,714
- So which one of you is taking a hike?
- And neither of us is quitting.

159
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:53,071
Interesting.

160
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:55,224
You were fine
with Chase and Cameron dating.

161
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:58,222
- You obviously don't actually have...
- You're fired.

162
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,851
How long are you gonna keep this up?
We know you're...

163
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,062
Wrong...

164
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,062
Again.

165
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:08,899
In the last few weeks, it's hard
to remember a correct call you made.

166
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,339
If Chase had compromised
his professional judgment

167
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:13,631
to help Cameron,
I'd have fired his ass, too.

168
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:17,032
When my mistake blew up, you did
everything to keep me from contacting

169
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:20,119
- the drug company.
- To save your license, not your job

170
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:22,567
and definitely not
your relationship.

171
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:24,786
So, badge.

172
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:29,264
Fine.

173
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:46,199
Why don't you see
if you can find us a real case?

174
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:55,825
How can you discharge me when
you have no idea what's wrong?

175
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,657
We know what's wrong,
and now that you've slept it off...

176
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:02,441
It's not just a hallucination.
I feel nauseous.

177
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,887
My foot feels numb
like it's fallen asleep.

178
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,718
- You didn't mention that before.
- I didn't notice it before.

179
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:10,502
Are you hiding from someone?
Why are you so intent on staying here?

180
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,672
I don't feel well. I know there's
something wrong with me.

181
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,216
Which foot?

182
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:16,675
My left.

183
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:25,642
Oh, God.

184
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,504
What the hell is that?
What is that?

185
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,597
Your toe just fell off.

186
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:42,483
Must be my lucky day.

187
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,887
New symptom means the old
symptom was a real symptom,

188
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:48,791
and I get to keep
our pederast priest after all.

189
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,502
- Where are Foreman and Thirteen?
- They left.

190
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:54,457
Leprosy can cause necrosis
and hallucination.

191
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:56,566
- Why would they leave?
- Because Foreman

192
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:59,323
doesn't work here anymore,
and Thirteen

193
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,886
is mad that I fired him.

194
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,181
Don't worry. She'll be back.

195
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:06,497
She'll be pissed off.
She'll want to take a stand.

196
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:07,923
And he will convince her

197
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,283
that there's no reason both
of them should be out of a job.

198
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:11,544
Leprosy's a bad fit.

199
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,859
- Why'd you fire Foreman?
- I gave him a choice, split or quit.

200
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:16,618
He chose neither.

201
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:19,843
- What about ergotism?
- He's giving up his career for her?

202
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:21,723
He's giving up this career for her.

203
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:25,225
No, normal white blood count.
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

204
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,278
- They're good doctors.
- Separately, they're great doctors,

205
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:29,738
better than you.

206
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:31,462
Together, they're morons.

207
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:34,692
Check out the house that they would've
checked had this been a real case.

208
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:37,279
And page Thirteen. Tell her
to run the blood for C-O.

209
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:40,622
Get the priest in a hyperbaric chamber
before anything else falls off.

210
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:45,938
So what are we gonna do now?

211
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:50,159
I get a letter of recommendation
from Cuddy and find a new job.

212
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:52,386
Oh, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

213
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:55,030
House is right.

214
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,840
Our relationship
did affect my judgment.

215
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,106
Then I should quit.

216
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:02,261
It'll be easier for me
to find another job.

217
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:04,471
Not like this one.

218
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:09,059
- We should both quit.
- What's that gonna accomplish?

219
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:11,895
Don't worry.

220
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:13,416
I'll be fine.

221
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:17,436
We'll be fine.

222
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:30,499
Go ahead.

223
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,010
I'll see you tonight?

224
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:34,569
I'll be home early.

225
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:43,791
You really think House
is done with Foreman?

226
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,958
If you ask me, Foreman
should be done with Thirteen.

227
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,475
He's not gonna get a better job,
Which means he'll end up resenting her

228
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,892
for losing this one,
which she'll end up resenting.

229
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:54,021
Or the hardship'll bring 'em
closer together.

230
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,460
She'll invite friends over
for Foreman to share.

231
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,155
- No leaks in the heater.
- She's not a nympho.

232
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,278
She's bisexual,
which, by the way, means

233
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,395
she's accustomed to partners who don't
need a map to find the treasure.

234
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,514
C-O poisoning might have come
from these cigarettes.

235
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:10,788
Not unless he was smoking them
in a bell jar.

236
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,471
Even if you know where the treasure is,
it can still be pretty hard

237
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:16,178
- to dig it up without a shovel.
- You can buy a shovel.

238
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:27,733
Let's see...

239
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:30,441
how do I keep House from ruining

240
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,767
my precious display
of religious hypocrisy?

241
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,545
I know, I'll pressure him to attend,

242
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,232
knowing that he'll never agree
to anything I actually want him to do.

243
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:40,646
I didn't pressure you.
I invited you.

244
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,716
And there's nothing hypocritical
about recognizing your heritage.

245
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:45,450
So you keeping kosher now,

246
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:49,475
wearing four-cornered garments,
slaughtering heifers to the God Ra?

247
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:52,124
Wait, is that one your people?

248
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:55,582
Do it all, do nothing, or option "c":
you're a liar and a hypocrite.

249
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:00,866
For better or for worse,
you are a part of my life.

250
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,706
It isn't a ploy.

251
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:06,228
It's a sincere invitation.
I honestly want you to come.

252
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:10,264
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

253
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,890
I'm glad.

254
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:20,469
You idiot.

255
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:24,323
I was free and clear.
Now he's coming, and it's your fault.

256
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,359
Since when have your failed attempts

257
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:29,025
at communication through lies
become my fault?

258
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,430
Since you forgot
how to keep your mouth shut.

259
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:35,200
You messed it up,
and now you're gonna fix it.

260
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,082
And you're gonna keep
my name out of it.

261
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:42,057
How is he?

262
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:44,176
Stable. Necrosis doesn't look
to be spreading.

263
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:47,053
I was talking about Foreman.
Is he really gonna leave?

264
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:49,094
That'swhat people do
when they get fired.

265
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,071
Why are you biting my head off?
I was asking what he was gonna do.

266
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:54,098
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.

267
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,771
It's not House's fault either.
He gave you a chance, you blew it.

268
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,727
He didn't give a chance,
but an ultimatum.

269
00:15:58,852 --> 00:16:01,637
I would've thought 5 years
here would buy a mistake or two.

270
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:03,837
Help me!

271
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,529
Help me!

272
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,244
I can't breathe!
Feels like something's on my chest!

273
00:16:14,718 --> 00:16:16,257
Looks like a heart attack.

274
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,708
I assume you've heard.

275
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,426
I can't override him.

276
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,309
I'm not asking you to override him.

277
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:34,554
I'm asking for a letter
of recommendation.

278
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:37,653
Eric, the reality here is...

279
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:40,145
House should've fired you.

280
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:42,100
You falsified medical records,

281
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:44,777
put this hospital's reputation
in jeopardy.

282
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:46,985
You're lucky
you still have a license.

283
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:51,949
I can't get a decent position at another
hospital without a recommendation.

284
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,892
Chest pain wasn't angina.

286
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:06,614
Ekg ruled out heart attack.

287
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:09,278
So the good news is,
he didn't have a heart attack.

288
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,624
The bad news is,
I apparently fired the only guy

289
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:14,143
who actually knows
what a heart attack looks like.

290
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,967
So the man of God who doesn't believe
in God had a heart attack

291
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:18,540
that isn't a heart attack.

292
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,605
Do I know how to pick
awesome cases or what?

293
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:22,682
Could be a clotting disorder.

294
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,525
3 different symptoms,
3 different clots?

295
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,493
I know.
How cool is that?

296
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,371
You two do an angio.

297
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:34,854
You don't want to work, so why don't you
just go get me a lottery ticket?

298
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,991
The sicker he gets,
the luckier I feel.

299
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:38,616
Where are you going?

300
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,492
I've been wanting
to introduce myself.

301
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,259
Are you really a virgin?

302
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,390
You have to treat me,
not to believe me.

303
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:56,032
And before we treat you,
we have to diagnose you.

304
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,646
Not knowing whether we can believe you
is making that difficult.

305
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:00,355
Everything I've told you is true.

306
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,357
You lost your faith
because a teenager got confused?

307
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,001
And the church abandoned me,
and my God forsook me,

308
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,556
and couldn't come up with a reason
why God would do that.

309
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,864
God gave the church
and the kid free will.

310
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,367
Their exercise
of that free will hurt you.

311
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,626
Means you're just a victim
of god's gift to mankind. Oh, yeah.

312
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:21,447
God wants life to have meaning.
Life's meaningless without free will.

313
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:24,210
With free will,
there's always suffering.

314
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:26,755
So God wants suffering.
I got tired of that argument

315
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,755
before I even finished saying it.

316
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,341
And even if I bought that,
what the hell is God doing?

317
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,030
Just the big stuff?

318
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,305
The acts of God, the hurricanes,
the earthquakes,

319
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,766
the random killings of millions
of innocent people.

320
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:40,726
Then we better damn pray.

321
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,730
God, I wish you weren't a pedophile.

322
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,359
Lungs are clean.
No embolism.

323
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:50,027
No pleurisy, no pneumonia.

324
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:52,241
I'm sorry.
This is gonna hurt.

325
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:53,673
No, it's fine.

326
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:56,249
- No pain at all?
- No.

327
00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:58,189
Why?

328
00:18:58,314 --> 00:19:00,014
Because there should be.

329
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,290
You feel that?

330
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:06,345
Regional anesthesia
is a new symptom.

331
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,755
Not if the chest pain
is related to the numbness.

332
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,049
It's not circulatory. It's neurological.
Run a nerve-conduction study.

333
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:13,571
And be careful.

334
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:16,293
If you kill him, he'll be
dancing with the dark one.

335
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,890
Why the hell are you going
to Cuddy's baby naming?

336
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,565
It's a religious ceremony.
It's boring.

337
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,565
Why waste which
that could be much better spent

338
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,309
in a drunken stupor
feeling sorry for yourself?

339
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,327
Okay?
Okay, you won't go?

340
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:34,808
Okay, your obligation
to Cuddy is fulfilled.

341
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,022
- Why are you doing this?
- Why did Hillary conquer Everest?

342
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:40,763
You always have a reason.
It's usually a bad one, but a reason.

343
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,060
- She's being childish.
- An example from the bad category.

344
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:46,364
Is it resentment?
The stork brought home a new baby,

345
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,296
and you don't want to share mommy?
Or you...

346
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,379
just can't stand
to see others happy?

347
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:54,047
She's trying to play me. If I let her
succeed, the terrorists win.

348
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,267
I heard there might be
an opening in the e.r.

349
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,062
Foreman's a neurologist.
That's not where he...

350
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,855
I did an e.r. rotation in Miami.

351
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:11,108
If I can find another position,
I figure House will rehire Foreman.

352
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:12,867
Don't quit.

353
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,893
Cuddy wouldn't give him
a recommendation.

354
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:17,865
- He's not able to find a decent job.
- Foreman shouldn't leave either.

355
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,733
You think they should split up?

356
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:22,907
Office romances are a bad idea.

357
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,603
We beat some very long odds.

358
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,125
Why don't you save
the gushy stuff for the wedding?

359
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,993
House is playing.
If you let him get away,

360
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:33,673
- he's not gonna respect you anyway.
- Or House is helping you.

361
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:37,786
He knows it probably won't work out.
And he's actually doing you a favor.

362
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,623
Yeah, that sounds
a lot more like House.

363
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:43,934
I know they're looking
for someone at Mercy. I'll make a call.

364
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:48,787
- Your boss always like that?
- Usually worse.

365
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:51,765
Finding a fellow atheist
always makes his day.

366
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,506
Think it's possible
maybe God's testing your faith?

367
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:55,754
No, I already failed.

368
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,238
There'd be no point
in what he's doing to me now.

369
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:00,942
Got something.
Looks like intercostal neuralgia.

370
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:02,167
What's that?

371
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,224
Something's traumatizing
one of the nerves

372
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:05,746
that runs along your ribs.

373
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,050
Explains the chest pain and numbness.
Could also cause muscle atrophy.

374
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:11,419
- Does it do anything to the eyes?
- Why? What's wrong?

375
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,006
Are you seeing jesus again?

376
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:15,131
I'm seeing nothing.
My right eye went blind.

377
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:25,351
Ophthalmological exam's normal.
Nothing structurally wrong with the eye.

378
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:26,700
His heart rate's down.

379
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:29,555
Sensory loss is becoming more diffuse,
progressive muscle weakness

380
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,789
- He's shutting down.
- It's got to be systemic,

381
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:33,355
like autoimmune.

382
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,107
- CSF was clear for guillain-barre.
- Cancer?

383
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:43,073
Imaging studies have been clear
for tumors.

384
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:44,646
Then that leaves infection.

385
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,512
He'd be brimming
with white blood cells.

386
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:50,408
Or we are at the backstage door
of a Duran Duran concert.

387
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:53,322
Hundreds of screaming girls
clustered around.

388
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,272
- What does that mean?
- That girls like rock bands.

389
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:59,561
The presence of the fans
indicates the presence of the band.

390
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,961
Different night...
same band, same door.

391
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:04,780
Now there's not a girl in sight.
What does that mean?

392
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:06,559
Sorry, I don't speak hair band.

393
00:22:06,684 --> 00:22:08,737
They weren't a hair band.
They were new romantics.

394
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:11,406
- The band already left?
- Nope, the band's still there,

395
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,119
still rocking out.

396
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:16,709
When does the absence of the fans
not indicate the absence of the band?

397
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:22,569
- When it's 2009.
- There aren't any Duran Duran fans.

398
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:25,111
They don't make them anymore.
If there's no infection,

399
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:27,470
it's because there aren't
any fans, no white cells.

400
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,114
You think...

401
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,704
his spleen?

402
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,227
Why do I bother with these metaphors
if I still have to spell it out?

403
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:37,521
Yes, I think it's his spleen.
Go get a biopsy.

404
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:40,289
I'll try to get new moon on Monday
out of my head.

405
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,894
Why are you talking this time?

406
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,535
If I quit, will you rehire Foreman?

407
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:55,247
- Why?
- He can't find another job. I can.

408
00:22:56,027 --> 00:22:58,647
You're willing to make
that sacrifice for him?

409
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:02,480
Foreman know about this plan?

410
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,880
If he's okay with it,
who am I to say no?

411
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:18,483
Hold still.

412
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,647
You think it's my spleen?

413
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,077
That's what they're testing.

414
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:31,436
So if I happen to cure you,
what happens then?

415
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:35,295
You start thinking that God
was working through me?

416
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,987
This is some sort of miracle?

417
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:38,624
Do you think I'm an idiot?

418
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,645
That's what I'm testing.

419
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:43,669
Losing my faith
wasn't a choice I made.

420
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:45,859
It happened.
It's gone for good.

421
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:49,325
But if it can magically disappear,
it can magically reappear,

422
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:51,672
and that's what you're hoping.

423
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,014
- Your job...
- Sucks.

424
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:55,961
That's my point.

425
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,633
You can make more money
frapping decafs,

426
00:23:58,758 --> 00:24:01,060
and yet you're still ministering
to the meek.

427
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:04,041
Why do the Lord's work
if the Lord has left the building?

428
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:07,653
I've been with the church my entire
adult life. It's my marketable skill.

429
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,645
I detect the stink
of leftover faith.

430
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,868
You want to talk hypocrisy,
what about you?

431
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:17,023
You act like you don't care
about anyone,

432
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:19,244
but here you are saving lives.

433
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:21,416
Solving puzzles.

434
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,921
Saving lives
is just collateral damage.

435
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,239
Yeah, nice try.

436
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,386
You're not looking
for somebody to prove you right.

437
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:30,885
I think you're looking for somebody
to prove you wrong, to give you hope.

438
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,514
You want to believe, don't you?

439
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:42,813
I want to walk out and find myself
in a forest of whore trees,

440
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:46,734
but I don't think it's a good idea
to tell people to fornicate with fruit.

441
00:24:54,517 --> 00:24:56,277
I was just talking about you...

442
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:59,491
not you specifically...
whores and hypocrisy.

443
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:01,886
You were right.

444
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:03,474
I don't want you there.

445
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:06,993
It's a special occasion
filled with love and acceptance,

446
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:09,131
and the last thing I need

447
00:25:09,316 --> 00:25:11,975
is someone there who's filled
with loathing and contempt.

448
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:17,890
That's it?

449
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,285
You're really not coming?

450
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,587
I'm really not coming.

451
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:28,415
You're welcome.

452
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,170
Gosh, I feel so grown up.

453
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:37,308
He's obviously just jerking you around,
wants to see if you're serious.

454
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,553
If you stick it out,
I think he'll bring Foreman back.

455
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:42,998
I don't, and even if I'm wrong,
I think you should still split up.

456
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:45,167
It's a matter of time
before one of you

457
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:47,378
finds the other in bed
with another woman.

458
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:50,673
- From the relationship expert.
- 12 years and counting.

459
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,175
Hey, if you can make it
that long, then anyone can.

460
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,879
Funny how the 2 people in the room

461
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:57,680
who think relationships are easy
are both single.

462
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,156
I don't think they're.

463
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,433
That's why if you find
something that could be good,

464
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:03,980
- you should hang on to it.
- Everything could be good.

465
00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:05,607
Very lite ever is.

466
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:08,507
His spleen is fine, just some
insignificant traces of minor bugs.

467
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:11,335
- Nothing that'd make him sick.
- Which minor bugs?

468
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,574
Why do people suddenly find
religion when they have kids?

469
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:19,479
Fear of the unknown.

470
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:21,814
Cornerstone of faith.

471
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,592
I think it makes perfect sense.

472
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:27,227
So it makes sense
because it doesn't make sense.

473
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:30,688
The fact that you're railing about it
doesn't make a lot of sense.

474
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:34,736
You really got a thing
for your boss, huh?

475
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:37,094
I've got a thing
for my boss's thing.

476
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:40,243
She doesn't have a thing... per se.

477
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:42,289
I'm big on metaphors.

478
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,900
What about you?

479
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:46,575
29 years of celibacy.

480
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,564
What's holding you back now?

481
00:26:49,227 --> 00:26:51,220
Who wants a relationship
with a priest?

482
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:52,985
Who wants a relationship?

483
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,162
It's the holy water.

484
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:06,578
We assumed if it was an infection,
it had to be something big and nasty.

485
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:08,510
But he has pneumocystis,

486
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:11,468
a harmless bug that's everywhere
and never makes anyone sick,

487
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:13,630
unless they have
a compromised immune system.

488
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,641
So father Nietzsche has aids.

489
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,395
Impossible.

490
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:33,885
I've never had a blood transfusion.

491
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,196
I've never done i.v. drugs.
I've never had sex.

492
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:38,349
So prove it. Have an aids test.

493
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:40,657
I know I don't have.

494
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:42,949
We can't treat you
until we know what it is.

495
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:46,414
A negative result proves nothing.
On the off chance it's a false positive,

496
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,652
I permanently lose any credibility
I have left.

497
00:27:48,777 --> 00:27:51,960
- I'd say you just lost that.
- I lost that with you a long time ago.

498
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,719
- We should start treatment.
- We need to be sure.

499
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,220
The antiretrovirals could fry his heart,
his liver, his kidneys.

500
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,357
- I'm willing to take that chance.
- Big of you.

501
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:05,147
I'm worried
about the kid he molested.

502
00:28:05,272 --> 00:28:06,690
We should be getting him tested.

503
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:09,494
- You don't think he already got tested?
- Maybe he did, maybe he didn't,

504
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:11,477
But that's a chance
I'm not willing to take.

505
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:13,896
Legally, we can't inform
sexual partners about Stds.

506
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:16,601
This isn't some middle-aged
barfly who likes it bareback.

507
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:18,458
This is an innocent kid
who was molested.

508
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,262
You want to rub
the priest's face in it,

509
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:21,994
- Get him transferred again.
- Yeah,

510
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,368
heaven forbid,
a diddler has job issues.

511
00:28:24,587 --> 00:28:26,370
And you get brought up on charges.

512
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:30,207
I've lost enough doctors this week.
Treat him for AIDS.

513
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:34,877
I found a job.

514
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:37,584
I didn't know you were looking.

515
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:39,800
Eggers at Mercy
says I can start monday.

516
00:28:40,577 --> 00:28:43,085
- Why would you...
- House says if I go, you can come back.

517
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,931
It's been less than two days.

518
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,695
Give up on me that fast?
You get a job behind my back?

519
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,518
You're acting like
I'm cheating on you.

520
00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:51,587
I said I would handle this.

521
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:54,398
House knew you'd be like this.

522
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,775
I guess House knows me
better than you do.

523
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,684
Too bad I don't go both ways.

524
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:05,710
Good night.

525
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,917
Don't you hate when they put the
mushrooms underneath the cheese?

526
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:17,546
Your attendance
is validating her hypocrisy.

527
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:20,965
If she invited you
to a ceremonial lynching,

528
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,090
would you go?

529
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:24,528
It would depend
on what she was serving.

530
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:25,900
Everyone's a hypocrite.

531
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:29,308
Why are you suddenly so obsessed
with Cuddy's particular brand?

532
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:31,216
Just making conversation.

533
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:34,188
Would you rather we go back to
talking about mushrooms and cheese?

534
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,588
You're the hypocrite!
You want to go!

535
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:40,235
You don't resent this baby.
You want to be a part of it.

536
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:42,905
Yes, but not until
her 16th birthday...

537
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:44,791
- In some states.
- This is ridiculous.

538
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,765
You two deserve each other.
If you want to go,

539
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,203
just go and act like a human being.

540
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:51,288
Wow, solid advice.

541
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:54,608
Except for two things.
I'm acting like I don't want to go

542
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,293
because I don't want to go, and...

543
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:01,512
I am incapable of acting
like a human being.

544
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:16,104
Ryan?

545
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,068
I'm Dr. Chris Taub.
Can we talk?

546
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,654
Yeah.
What's wrong?

547
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:26,464
In private?

548
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,533
Nobody's listening to us here.

549
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:32,465
I work at
Princeton Plainsboro hospital.

550
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,623
I have some news
about Father Daniel Bresson.

551
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:37,793
What about him?

552
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:42,214
We believe he has AIDS.

553
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:44,883
Okay, so?

554
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:47,278
Well...

555
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,156
Given the incident four years ago,

556
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,765
I think you should be tested,

557
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:53,350
unless you've already done so.

558
00:30:58,655 --> 00:30:59,898
How sick is he?

559
00:31:00,118 --> 00:31:01,118
Very.

560
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:04,504
Okay.
Well, thanks.

561
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,698
Have you been tested?

562
00:31:11,194 --> 00:31:12,036
And?

563
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,789
And it really isn't any
of your business.

564
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:30,220
I want my job back.

565
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:35,350
Love, sacrifice, deception,

566
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,946
and now betrayal.

567
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:39,604
This is better than a telenovela.

568
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:41,593
- What's going on?
- Well...

569
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:43,859
Either Foreman is here,
as the two of you discussed,

570
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:46,971
to beg for his job back
in exchange for me dumping you.

571
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:48,096
Or...

572
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,614
nothing.

573
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:54,911
- You're trying to get me fired?
- I'm suggesting you quit

574
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:57,831
and I stay, which is exactly
what you suggested last night.

575
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,594
- I told Eggers I didn't want the job.
- Find another one.

576
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:03,033
Only took you eight hours
to find that one.

577
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,129
The point is...

578
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:06,117
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing this?

579
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,289
- Why are you here without me?
- you're overreacting.

580
00:32:08,414 --> 00:32:10,317
- We'll talk later.
- That's what this is about.

581
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:12,623
It's about you taking control.
You not being able

582
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:14,097
to handle me saving your ass.

583
00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:16,200
And you're not
being controlling right now?

584
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,685
Who's the controlling bitch now?

585
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:19,904
House, shut up.

586
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:23,514
You never wanted to take
that other job.

587
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:25,215
You never wanted to save me.

588
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:27,861
You wanted to offer to save me
so you wouldn't feel guilty.

589
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:29,696
You knew I'd say no.

590
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:32,157
That's why you're so mad right now.

591
00:32:35,535 --> 00:32:36,661
You're an idiot.

592
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:46,755
Either you can go after
her and try and patch things up,

593
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,258
or you blow her off
and take your old job back.

594
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:04,693
Welcome back.

595
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:12,039
AIDS meds aren't gonna work.

596
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:15,659
If you'd let us do a test, we could stop
treating you, or you could stop lying.

597
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:19,955
I know the feeling.

598
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,848
BP's climbing.
You feeling okay?

599
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:24,330
No, I feel flushed.

600
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,586
Ah, I'm burning all over.

601
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:28,133
Ah, my chest.

602
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:37,213
It's not a new symptom. It's
just a reaction to the AIDS meds.

603
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:39,616
He reacted by getting worse.
Means it's not AIDS.

604
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:42,820
So went Satan forth
from the presence of the Lord

605
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:45,487
and smote job sore with boils.

606
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:47,774
You think it's hyper-IGE syndrome?

607
00:33:48,014 --> 00:33:50,613
I prefer the colloquial term
"job syndrome."

608
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,813
Explains the symptoms, and my quote.

609
00:33:52,938 --> 00:33:55,091
That's the 1st thing I checked.
IGE levels are normal.

610
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:56,867
Could be some other
genetic disorder.

611
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:59,703
Cerebral microtumors could explain
the blindness and the hallucinations.

612
00:33:59,943 --> 00:34:01,677
We didn't find any tumors.

613
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:04,149
That's why I didn't say "tumors."
I said "microtumors."

614
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:07,502
So your explanation doesn't depend
on us being major morons, just morons?

615
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:11,405
- We should start genetic testing.
- Takes too long.

616
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,447
- So we start treatment.
- Treatment is surgery.

617
00:34:13,572 --> 00:34:14,991
We can't without confirmation.

618
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:17,179
So your position is we can't
test and we can't treat?

619
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:18,930
My position is you're wrong.

620
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,682
This isn't gonna work.

621
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,351
Are you kidding?
I've never felt more alive.

622
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:26,897
Conflict breeds creativity.
Go run the genetic tests.

623
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:28,297
On it.

624
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:37,574
So now you don't think I have AIDS?

625
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:40,388
I still think it's AIDS.
But on the off chance it isn't,

626
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,329
We're pursuing other avenues.

627
00:34:47,657 --> 00:34:48,657
Ryan.

628
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,654
He's...

629
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:54,716
he's dying?

630
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,426
We don't know what's wrong with him.

631
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,887
- Can I speak to him?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

632
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:05,079
Why don't I get you...

633
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:07,604
Come on, Ryan,
now's not a good ti...

634
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:18,156
I'm sorry...

635
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:25,679
for everything.

636
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:34,748
I'm sorry.

637
00:35:52,097 --> 00:35:53,097
I know.

638
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:56,674
I know.

639
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,425
Any second thoughts about Cuddy?

640
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:20,122
Nope.

641
00:36:20,706 --> 00:36:22,846
But please, feel free to blather on.

642
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,434
Raising a child on her own is scary.

643
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,748
She's just doing what you do,

644
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:29,997
what everyone does...
Trying to avoid pain.

645
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,935
Religion is not the opiate
of the masses.

646
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,476
Religion is the placebo
of the masses.

647
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,359
If you're saying
she's not a hypocrite...

648
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,310
I'm not.
I'm trying to give you

649
00:36:38,435 --> 00:36:39,850
a rational reason

650
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:41,937
to overlook her hypocrisy

651
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:44,436
so you don't feel
like a hypocrite for going.

652
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,144
Sorry. Continue.

653
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:51,875
Even if an absolute truth exists,
we can't know all of it,

654
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:55,215
and you can't condemn her
for recognizing that.

655
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,650
Are you eliminating symptoms?

656
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:19,069
We can know everything.

657
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:21,446
This is medicine, not metaphysics.

658
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:23,198
Truth is truth.

659
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:30,625
- it fits.
- it doesn't fit.

660
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:33,083
You can't eliminate a symptom.

661
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:35,251
I can if it's not a symptom.

662
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:36,533
Well, what is it?

663
00:37:37,128 --> 00:37:38,328
Not a symptom.

664
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,391
You're not gonna die.

665
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:54,437
You have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

666
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:56,856
It impairs your immune system,

667
00:37:57,096 --> 00:38:00,110
makes you susceptible to all the AIDS
stuff without actually having AIDS.

668
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,405
And you didn't catch it.
You were born with it.

669
00:38:03,644 --> 00:38:05,244
Another gift from god.

670
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,419
- You sure?
- Genetic test should confirm it,

671
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:12,438
but it explains all your symptoms...

672
00:38:12,862 --> 00:38:14,564
Toe, chest, eyes, skin.

673
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:16,167
What about my hallucination?

674
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:18,927
Scotch explains that.

675
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:24,718
But that was just a coincidence.

676
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:29,567
Coincidences do happen.

677
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:36,319
That coincidence is what brought me
to you in the first place.

678
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:41,612
You promised you wouldn't go there.

679
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:44,904
Einstein said,

680
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:48,557
"coincidence is God's way
of remaining anonymous."

681
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:50,941
A woman in Florida said,

682
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:53,371
"look, Jesus
is on my cheese sandwich."

683
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,036
You didn't even want
to take my case.

684
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:58,334
You didn't even think I was sick.

685
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:02,337
The fact that I was wrong
is not a proof of God.

686
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:08,675
I'm just trying to understand

687
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,200
how my life could completely
turn around in a single day.

688
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:18,847
Don't worry. Your life will go back
to sucking soon enough.

689
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,843
Everything that happened to you

690
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:24,277
can be rationally explained.

691
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,630
I know.

692
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:28,719
It's just...

693
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:35,860
That's a lot of coincidences.

694
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:55,266
House was right about the priest.

695
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:58,102
Genetic test confirmed
it was Wiskott-Aldrich.

696
00:39:58,448 --> 00:39:59,813
And I would've discharged him.

697
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:02,232
Everybody would've discharged him,
House included.

698
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:05,401
He only took that case as a stall.

699
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,279
And yet it was a real case,
and he solved it.

700
00:40:09,278 --> 00:40:11,783
But by violating his own principles

701
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:14,202
and ignoring the admitting symptoms.

702
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:16,287
Still he somehow got away with it.

703
00:40:18,404 --> 00:40:19,825
Saved another life.

704
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:23,503
You want him there tonight.

705
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,671
You should tell him.

706
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:51,635
It's cold out there.

707
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,273
At least you have shoes
that cover your toes.

708
00:40:57,261 --> 00:40:58,371
So it's tonight?

709
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:02,010
Bad weather for it, huh?

710
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:03,819
Maybe you'll get lucky.

711
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:06,124
Maybe your sister will decide
the roads are...

712
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:08,137
too dangerous to drive on.

713
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:10,266
Fingers crossed.

714
00:41:16,837 --> 00:41:17,974
Have fun.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
