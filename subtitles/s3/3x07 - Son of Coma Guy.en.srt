<i>MAN.: See you Tuesday.
WOMAN.: How about right now?</i>

3
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:17,741
<i>What? What?</i>

4
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:20,586
<i>You wanna throw in the towel?</i>

5
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:22,134
<i>No, I don't wanna
throw in the... towel!</i>

6
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:23,975
<i>I thought
that's what you said!</i>

7
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,816
<i>I'm not upset about anything!</i>

00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,126
<i>Where the... are we going?</i>

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,464
What are you doing
down here?

11
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:34,142
I thought you usually
had lunch with Coma Guy.

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,904
This is Vegetative State Guy.
Better company.

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,414
Hey, hey, tell him
about those Sherpas

14
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,590
you dropped acid with
in Saint Patrick's Cathedral.

15
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:45,314
You stole my prescription pad
and you forged my name.

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,707
What did you tell the cop?
I lied.

17
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,172
They'd have put you away
for 10 years,

18
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:53,431
after they took your license
to practice medicine.

19
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:54,686
So, everything's good, then.

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,778
I lied. To the cops.

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,410
There is no case
unless they can prove

22
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:01,213
that either
I got the drugs illegally
or I sold them illegally.

23
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:03,305
I didn't do the second,
you lied about the first.
Game over.

24
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,979
Yeah, Tritter's just playing.

25
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,573
He's gonna see
how clever you are
and then just walk away.

26
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:09,163
The important thing is
that you keep prescribing

27
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,925
the same amount of drugs to me
or it'll look suspicious.

28
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,222
Here's another way
to look at it,

29
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:15,105
having forced me
to lie to the police,

30
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:18,368
your first concern
is securing
your drug connection.

(DOOR OPENING)

32
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:25,649
Joining my father for lunch?

33
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:27,531
I should have called ahead
for a table.

34
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:28,703
Dr. House was just...

35
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:30,377
Enjoying a Reuben.

36
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:31,841
It's okay.

37
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:35,900
After 10 years,
anything that'll get doctors
in the same room as...

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,163
What are you doing?
Nothing.

39
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:40,921
What are you doing?

40
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,351
Chips?

41
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:49,916
Wanna see something
really cool?

42
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:58,619
I saw you leaving
last Tuesday.

43
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:01,339
You practically
tripped over two guys
on your way out,

44
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,264
but you had no problem
opening doors.

45
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:04,937
It's called akinetopsia.

46
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,155
You can't see things
when they move.

47
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:10,460
Now, since you haven't been
hit by a bus, I assume
that it's intermittent.

48
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:11,925
It's probably
accompanied by seizures,

49
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:15,230
which made me think that
I could set one off
by flashing the...

50
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:23,096
God, I love this family.

51
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,469
I can see fine now.

52
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:07,071
I've had seizures before.
Most of the time
they're small.

53
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:10,544
Doctors ran me through
all the tests.
Couldn't find anything.

54
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:12,803
Any history of epilepsy
in your family?

55
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,770
The only things I know
that run in my family are

56
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:18,410
a lot of chutzpah
and the ability to sleep
for 10 years.

57
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:20,293
Although
I'm not really an expert.

58
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:22,301
Dad never really liked
my mother's side
of the family,

59
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:26,276
and after she died
and he came here
I was raised by a guardian.

60
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:29,372
I wouldn't even know
how to get in touch with them.

61
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:30,962
How about your father's side
of the family?

62
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,343
Any relatives
we could speak with?

63
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:33,891
My father was an only child.

64
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,272
And my grandparents
are dead.

65
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:36,444
Well, who did you put down

66
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:39,247
as the person the hospital
should contact
in an emergency?

67
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,293
I left it blank.

68
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:41,967
There's gotta be someone,
a friend...

69
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:43,180
I have plenty of friends.

70
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,690
Just no one that would care
if I was here.

71
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:50,753
Say, do you mind passing me
my backpack?

72
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:54,310
(CLINKING)

73
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,820
Hair of the dog.

74
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,883
CAMERON: Could be infection.
FOREMAN: Or a brain tumor.

75
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,054
Says he had a CT.

76
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:15,146
What's wrong
with the simplest explanation?
Trauma?

77
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:16,402
He didn't report any injuries.

78
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:18,410
He didn't report
being an alcoholic, either.

79
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:21,046
Drinking equals falling down
equals trauma equals...

80
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:22,176
Maybe it's inherited.

81
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:25,607
How would you jump to genetics
from his EEG?

82
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:28,326
All you've got
are some vaguely
epileptiform waves.

83
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,548
It's not his EEG.
It's his father's.

84
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,477
When it comes
to cortical seizures,
like father, like son.

85
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,983
Small seizures
aren't unheard of

86
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,448
in a patient
in a vegetative state.

87
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,996
Similarities
are interesting, though.

88
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,628
What caused
the vegetative state?

89
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,301
His house burned down.

90
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:43,933
Went back in to get his wife,

91
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:45,523
firefighters
found him unconscious

92
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:47,531
three feet from the bedroom,
asphyxiated.

93
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,372
Not an inherited condition.

94
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,013
Test his DNA.
Start with
adrenomyeloneuropathy.

95
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,272
Check out the home.

96
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:02,929
He has a single bed.

97
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:04,226
They still make single beds?

98
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:06,109
It could mean
he just doesn't have sex,

99
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:08,536
though there were condoms
in the apartment.

100
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:11,506
House asked you
to check out
the home for toxins.

101
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,808
No mold, no leaks, no pets.

102
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:15,941
MRI and LP
are both inconclusive.

103
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,824
Infection's still possible,
tumor's less likely, but...

104
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,833
DNA?
The adrenomyeloneuropathy test

105
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:20,879
was negative.

106
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,050
DNA test again.

107
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:24,226
Try Unverricht-Lundborg
and late-onset Lafora's.

108
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,649
CHASE: Genetic tests
take forever.

109
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:28,661
You can't just keep testing
for every inherited condition
you think it might be.

110
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,632
Well, not me.
I'll be leaving early.
But you guys can.

111
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,912
You said no one's been sick
but what about
delivery people, repair guy?

112
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:41,381
I wouldn't know.
I work from home.

113
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,640
Haven't been to the office
in over a month.

114
00:05:43,724 --> 00:05:44,812
CAMERON: Visitors?

115
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:46,067
Haven't had any.

116
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:47,950
The only person
I've seen in the last week

117
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:51,172
was the pizza delivery guy
and he looked pretty healthy.

118
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:54,226
There's gotta be someone
you're close to.

119
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:58,159
Actually, the person
I see most often
is my father.

120
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,092
He's asleep
so he can't stop me.

121
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:06,318
(GROANS)

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,490
What is it?

123
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:09,833
I'm just feeling
a little nauseous.

124
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:14,561
I think his liver's failing.

125
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:17,406
God. Does that mean
that I'm...

126
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,347
We need a central line kit,

127
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,444
two units of
packed red blood cells
type O Negative.

128
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:29,874
He's unconscious
and heading for a coma.

129
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,757
He's at a four
on the RLAS scale.

130
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,105
Stop all treatment.

131
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:37,531
You think this is a reaction
to our meds?

132
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:39,665
Well, they're obviously
not helping.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,255
Given the fact
that he's an alcoholic,

134
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:43,515
there's a good chance
his liver wasn't so hot
when he came in.

135
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,774
Anti-seizure drugs
could have just pushed him
over the edge.

136
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:48,368
We take him off those meds,
what do we put him on?

137
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:49,456
I was hoping you'd know.

138
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:52,720
It may be academic,
I just started him
on dialysis.

139
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:56,402
Kidney and liver failure.
Not too many people
come back from that.

140
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,619
Trauma's out of the picture.
Could still be infection.

141
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:00,879
Or neurological...
Or genetic.

142
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:04,059
We need a better history.

143
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,992
Did you miss the part
where the patient
lost consciousness?

144
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:11,255
L-dopa?

145
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:14,644
You're not waking Kyle.
You're waking his father.

146
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:16,653
I commend
your observational skills.

147
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:17,782
You have no reason to think

148
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,084
any amount of drugs
will wake a man from a coma.

149
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,883
Vegetative state.
Much easier.

150
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,644
This guy's no Terry Schiavo,
his brain's all there,
he moves around,

151
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,360
his muscles
have barely atrophied.

152
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:28,661
He's just waiting
for a fairy-tale kiss.

153
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,172
After I do that,
I'll stick a needle in him.

154
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:36,025
The amount
of amphetamines alone
would be dangerous,

155
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:38,201
besides
whatever the hell else
you've got in there.

156
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,251
There are reports
out of South Africa

157
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,435
about a pill that would
temporarily revive someone
in a vegetative state.

158
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,029
<i>You've all seen Awakenings,
made me cry.</i>

159
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:48,745
I wanna cry.

160
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:50,921
CUDDY: Put the syringe down.

161
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:55,105
I can outdraw you,
mysterious stranger.

162
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:57,197
We don't experiment
on helpless patients.

163
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,414
Be reasonable.
There's no way
this is gonna work.

164
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:02,050
Even if you woke him,
it would only be
for a few hours.

165
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:03,891
A day, two at the most.

166
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,230
You're risking his life.

167
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:08,075
I'm risking getting sued,
that's the only
objection here.

168
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:10,502
You'll be torturing him
and his family.

169
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:13,891
Well, good news for Legal,
the only family
he's got is upstairs dying.

170
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,188
Hey!

171
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:25,565
I want this patient monitored
for the next 24 hours.

172
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:27,280
I want someone with him
at all times

173
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:28,745
to make sure
you didn't kill him.

174
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:31,004
I want your ass in my office.

175
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,218
(MOANING)

176
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,272
God, I'm starving.

177
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,004
I could really go for a steak.

178
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,247
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you are?

179
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:53,180
Gabriel Wozniak.
I don't know the name
of this hospital.

180
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:55,356
How much are three and five?

181
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:57,239
Eight.

182
00:08:57,364 --> 00:09:01,255
Also known as half of 16,
a quarter of 32,
two to the third power.

183
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,059
Coolest thing ever.

184
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:06,318
Any history of seizure
in your family?

185
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,117
No.
Liver disease?

186
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:09,121
No.

187
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:11,297
How long have I been here?
I...

188
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,100
I got the feeling
it's been a long time.

189
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:15,188
Interesting.

190
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,448
Your internal clock
kept ticking.

191
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,958
How deep
does that awareness go?

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,339
Pick up scraps
of conversations?

193
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:22,469
Do you have the vague sense

194
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,435
that the
hospital administrator
dresses like a trollop?

195
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,866
<i>Or that the new
Star Wars movies
were a disappointment?</i>

196
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:32,762
I know my wife is dead.

197
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,912
I don't know
how long it's been.

198
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,933
Ten years.

199
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,046
What's the last thing
you remember?

200
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,515
The fire.

201
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,155
My wife was in the bedroom,
she had taken a sleeping pill.

202
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:01,004
I got Kyle out,
went back in for her.

203
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:04,686
I knew I didn't make it.

204
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,109
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:09,791
What about your wife's side
of the family?
Any history of seizures there?

206
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,469
Your son Kyle
is a patient here.

207
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:16,444
I'm afraid
his condition is serious.
He may be dying.

208
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,096
No seizure issues
on my wife's side, either.

209
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,778
What about that steak?
Nobody ever answered me.

210
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:31,506
(EXCLAIMS)

211
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,690
Rumor in the cafeteria
was Caustic Guy
was waking up Coma Guy.

212
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:37,364
Technically,
Vegetative State Guy

213
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:39,749
was woken by,
yeah, Caustic Guy.

214
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,795
So what happened?

215
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,891
I gotta get him a steak
before I can ask him
any more questions.

216
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,272
He doesn't wanna talk
about his son?

217
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:48,159
Didn't seem
to emotionally register
that his son is sick.

218
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:49,247
Brain issue?

219
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,883
He was asphyxiated,
spent 10 years as asparagus,

220
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:54,059
who knows
what damage is in there.
It's possible.

221
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,234
Of course there's always
the simple explanation.

222
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:58,368
Maybe he just
doesn't like his son.

223
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,460
Only in your world
would that be simple.

224
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:02,510
The delusion
that fathering a child

225
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,854
installs a permanent geyser
of unconditional love...

226
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:07,406
Maybe your father's feelings
were conditional,
not everyone's.

227
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,494
Well, of course,
that would play into

228
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:09,916
your romantic vision
of human...

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,297
In terms
you would understand,

230
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,929
we have
an evolutionary incentive

231
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,310
to sacrifice
for our offspring.

232
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,364
Our tribe, our friends.
Keep them safe.

233
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:20,795
Except for all the people
who don't.

234
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,887
Everything is conditional.

235
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,695
You just can't always
anticipate the conditions.

236
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:38,243
Mind if we talk
for a few minutes?

237
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:42,929
How many pills would you say
Dr. House takes a day?

238
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:46,109
I'm uncomfortable
setting a number.

239
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:47,573
Well, try.

240
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:49,916
Six.

241
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,343
A day?

242
00:11:54,184 --> 00:11:57,490
Has he ever had you
write prescriptions for him?

243
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,167
No. What is it
you want me to say?

244
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:02,510
That he takes too many pills
and is a danger
to the hospital,

245
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:05,816
or he takes too few
because
he's selling them on the side?

246
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,615
Either one is ridiculous.

247
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,540
I meant the former.

248
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,088
You're wrong.

249
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:15,021
Can I ask
what Dr. House has done
to deserve your loyalty?

250
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:17,071
He's not known
as a great boss.

251
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,577
He's not even
much of a friend.

252
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:21,590
Look how he left
Dr. Wilson holding the bag.

253
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:28,494
It's odd.
You don't know about that?

254
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:33,640
You defend him,
and he won't even tell you
what's happening in his life.

255

(PAGER BEEPING)

256
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,485
I was paged.

257
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:47,615
We saw you with the cop.

258
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:48,745
What'd he want?

259
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,167
How many pills
does House take,

260
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,381
did I ever write him
a prescription?

261
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:52,971
That sort of stuff.

262
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,941
I told him six.
A day or in a mouthful?

263
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,908
I was just hoping
you guys
would stay consistent with...

264
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,498
He wants to talk to us, too?

265
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:00,921
You're next.

266
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:04,310
We've gotta tell House
what's going on.

267
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,151
Tritter says no.
Then no it is.

I gotta get back
to our sleeper

before he goes looking
for the orgasmatron.

272
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:19,874
See, if that were rhetorical,

273
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,799
it would mean
that I can just turn around
and leave now,

274
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:23,556
which I'm not doing,
from which
you should deduce...

275
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,858
He's off all drugs
except the antibiotics.

276
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,741
His liver's just managing
to hang in there.

277
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:29,916
He's still sliding into coma.

Who gave you your clothes?

283

Dr. Cuddy.

284
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,774
I guess I'll need
all new ones, anyway.

285
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,322
Everything went in the fire.

286
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:58,494
Don't worry about it.

measles vaccination,

289
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:06,402
do you remember if he had it,
what type it was?

290
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:08,870
Man, you're a piece of work,
you know that?

291
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,385
You weren't gonna tell me,
were you?

292
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,389
I don't need new clothes.

00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:16,151
Dr. Cuddy says
my body
will adjust to the drugs,

294
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,159
that I'll be
a vegetable again
by tomorrow.

If I'm really lucky,
the day after.

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,971
Yeah.

If I've got a day to live,

298
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,695

in a hospital room
being grilled.

Business was sold off.

301

The only thing you have left
is down the hall,
heading for a liver biopsy.

You have one day to live,
and you want a sandwich?

People on death row
get a last meal.

309
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:02,427
The state provides it.
Who's providing for you?

310
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:05,481
You got a car? Money?

311
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:09,038
You're negotiating with me.

312
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:17,992
Take out another 100 for me.
And I need your car.

313
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:19,791
I'm not doing you any favors.

314
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,343
You'll get it back tomorrow.
Two days, max.

315
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,100
Road trip.

316
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,762
This is like trying
to control the weather,

317
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,854
but I'd prefer it
if you didn't eat in the car,

318
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,318
I just had it detailed.

319
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,033
I drive.
Oh, the hell he does.

320
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:39,205
Sure.

321
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:42,845
Aside from the fact
he just woke up
from a vegetative state,

322
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:43,975
the guy doesn't
have a license.

323
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:46,695
How about this?
Cops stop us, we lie.

324
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,080
You know how to do that.
Chips.

325
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:53,808
It's all the drugs
pumping through his system.

326

Right now his reflexes
are better
than Dale Earnhardt Jr's.

327
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:58,954
What's this? It says ipod.

328
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,557
I'm coming.

329
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,762
HOUSE: So let's talk about
toxic exposure.

00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:20,753
What was wrong
with the old colors?
I trusted brown.

331
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,264
Do the purple ones
have chocolate inside?

332
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:24,728
Raspberry cocaine.

Listen, I really need to know
about the candy because
I'm allergic to berries.

336
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,724
You didn't mention that.

337
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:35,021
Is it significant?

338
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:37,448
No. So where else
did you live?

339
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,372
List everywhere,
including vacations,

340
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,046
start with
when your wife got pregnant.

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,561

Then we moved to Jersey,
from there, Jersey.

00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,573
What are you waiting to hear?
About the little cottage
in the Amazon

343
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,749
with the mosquitoes
and the lead paint
all over the walls?

344
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:50,837
Yes.

345
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:52,552
You know what?

346
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,611
I didn't let you come along
so you could suck all the fun
out of my one day of life.

347
00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:59,874
Well, you're outta luck,
because
that's totally why I'm here.

348
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:03,640
Okay, rule change.

349
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:07,071
Person with the money
makes the rules.
Or in this case,

350
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:10,377
the person who's friends
with the person with the money
makes the rules.

351
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:13,013
Well, you want answers
more than I want money.

352
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:15,105
All right, so here's the game.

353
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:16,695
Ask whatever you want.

354
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:20,209
But for every question
I answer,
you have to answer one first.

355
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:22,427
Why would you care
about anything I have to say?

356
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:25,607
The day before I died,
I was a successful man.

357
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:29,540
I had a factory
with over 200 employees.

358
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,423
People listened when I talked.

359
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,682
I liked power.

360
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:39,958
Now, the only power
I have left
is the power to annoy you.

361
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:48,745
I took Wilson's assistant
for coffee.

362
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:51,213
Why?
Something Tritter said.

363
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:52,510
She told me the police think

364
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:56,109
that House stole
Wilson's prescription pad
and forged his name.

365
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,745
You believe it?

366
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:01,757
Do you?
Well, absolutely I do.

367
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:03,473
I'm just checking
how naive you are.

368
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:06,025
He's not gonna
steal his best friend's pad,
jeopardize his career.

369
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,075
Until his best friend
says no to him.

370
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:09,331
House is a junkie.

371
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:12,510
Junkies do
whatever they have to do
to get what they need.

372
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,987
Kyle's down to a three
on the RLAS scale.

373
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,707
He's only showing
localized response.

374
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:23,138
I'll call House,
tell him we're gonna need
an answer soon.

375
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,699
Get in your right lane
for 295.

376
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,042
And pass me the Twizzlers.

377
00:18:33,975 --> 00:18:35,649
I'm curious...
No, you're not.

378
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:37,239
Why would
a man's first instinct

379
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:39,289
be to drive away
from the only family
he's got?

380
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:42,218
No, this is no time
for you to do your thing.

381
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:44,686
We don't care
about his state of mind,
we don't care if he's happy.

382
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:47,239
This factory of yours,
what did you make?

383
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,678
So ask me a question.

384
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,226
I'm thinking.

385
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:55,858
Only six left, by the way.

386
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:58,536
So sign my name.
You don't need a doctor,
you need a pen.

387
00:18:58,619 --> 00:18:59,791
What is up with you two?

388
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,096
Wilson lied to the bulls
to keep me
out of the big house.

389
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:04,351
Are you out of your mind?

390
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,941
Well, who's he gonna tell?

391
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:09,121
By tomorrow night
he's gonna be
a mindless stalk of celery.

392
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,050
Since I answered that one,
by the way, my turn.

393
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,598
What did you make
in your factory?

394
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,937
Luxury boats.

395
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,364
Have you ever been in love?

396
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,536
Wow!

397
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,172
Going right for the closets
with the embarrassing stuff.
Good move.

398
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:23,138
Yes. Describe the boats.

399
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:26,946
Thirty-five to 65-foot hulls,
twin engines,
parquet floors in the galley,

400
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:29,038
staterooms with queen beds.

401
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,925
How'd you meet?
She shot me.

402
00:19:32,427 --> 00:19:35,690
These boats, I assume you used
mildew-resistant paint
on the hulls?

403
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:37,322
Naturally. Shot you?

404
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:41,046
Paintball.
Doctors versus lawyers.

405
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,138
Did you ever take
your son to the factory?
Sure.

406
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,444
He used to run
all over the place,
but it was perfectly safe.

407
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:48,996
Ever love anybody else?

408
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:52,510
No more questions,
I got my answer.

409
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:56,067
While Dad's in the office,
his son's
watching them spray-paint.

410
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,866
And what kid wears a mask?

411
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:00,628
Mercury specifically targets
the central nervous system.

412
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:01,757
You're saying
this is my fault?

413
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,059
Mercury poisoning
explains the seizures

414
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,983
and the liver's like
a big soup strainer.

415
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:08,410
The soup runs through,
chicken dumplings stay.

416
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:10,126
For soup, read blood,
for chicken...

417
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,632
I get it, I get it. Mercury.

418
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:12,762
Sits more or less idle

419
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:16,067
until your kid
pours tequila shooters
into his liver.

420
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:19,665
When the liver goes,
takes out the kidneys,
explains everything.

421
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:20,711
Yeah, it's me.

422
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:23,598
<i>Foreman, draw blood.
Test for mercury poisoning.</i>

423
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,565
Chase,
start heavy metal chelation

424
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,364
while we're waiting
for results.

425
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:29,749
Chase isn't here.
I'll start the...

426
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,962
Where is he?

427
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:33,849
The lab.

428
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:40,586
How many pills
does he take a day?

429
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:44,310
It's hard to say,
pain levels vary over time...

430
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:47,322
Could be six, eight, 10.

431
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:49,540
Ever write
any prescriptions for him?

432
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,046
Yes.
Why?

433
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:52,720
Did he tell you to?

434
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:54,728
He asked me to.

435
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:07,071
Medicine attracts people
who are attracted to power.

436
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,632
I know how he hates
when he is defied
by a patient.

437
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:16,109
I doubt he handles defiance
from his staff any better.

438
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,033
Now you correct me
if I'm wrong,

439
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:21,590
but I don't think
Dr. House asks for anything.

440
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,435
I think he takes it.

441
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:29,247
And I think that you are stuck
lying to the police

442
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:33,766
to cover up something
you didn't wanna do.

443
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:44,770
HOUSE: We have been
up and down St. James
like a Monopoly car.

444
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:47,908
It's not here.
Giancarlo has
left the building.

445
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,808
We can still turn around
and go back to Princeton.

446
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:56,485
No. We've come this far,
I'm getting the hoagie.

447
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,548
If your son does
have mercury poisoning,

448
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,389
there's a good chance
he'll respond
to the chelation.

449
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:05,649
You might be able to have
a few minutes with him
before you lapse.

450
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:07,908
Why are you so concerned
about me?

451
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,799
Deep inside Wilson believes
that if he cares enough

452
00:22:11,883 --> 00:22:13,473
he'll never have to die.

453
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:16,151
Your behavior isn't normal.

454
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:17,908
And you would know normal?

455
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:21,088
What could he have done
that you won't forgive
after 10 years?

456
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:23,180
When this
is your last chance?

457
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:26,360
My son is what he is.

458
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:29,080
His mother's side,
all drunken losers.

459
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:32,092
He's gone the same way.

460
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:36,318
House told you drinking
had damaged your son's liver.

461
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,531
I just said that.

462
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:38,870
But you didn't hear
him say that

463
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:40,795
until after
we left the hospital.

464
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,636
So why did you leave?

465
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:46,778
Maybe your son
takes after your side.

466
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:50,042
Seizures and an allergy
to emotional connections.

467
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:51,841
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

468
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:55,732
We're in Atlantic City
and my time's not up yet.

469
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,243
We find a hotel
with a casino.

470
00:23:02,385 --> 00:23:03,975
(MACHINE BEEPING)

471
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:05,481
BP's starting to drop.

472
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:07,699
O2-sat's down to 70.

473
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:13,808
Point-three milligrams
of epi in.

474
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:15,481
What are you trying to do,
make him bleed faster?

475
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:17,155
Check the pulse.

476
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:19,498
It's not his liver.

477
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:22,050
It's the heart.

478
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:24,728
WILSON: I understand
he's a French chef

479
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,653
but I'm sure
he can handle this.

480
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:28,536
You need a 12-inch
Italian roll,

481
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,720
oregano vinegar,
no, not balsamic vinegar,
oregano vinegar.

482
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:35,732
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

483
00:23:36,276 --> 00:23:37,531
Game's still on.

484
00:23:37,573 --> 00:23:39,749
I thought the answer
was mercury poisoning.

485
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,757
What other questions
would you care about?

486
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:42,971
If you each had
one day to live,

487
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,653
you'd look for one last meal
and House would look
for one last answer.

488
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:49,707
WILSON: No, can you just
send the ingredients up here

489
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,716
and I'll make it myself.

490
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:55,983
Last 10 years,
how much awareness
did you have?

491
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,828
I don't know,
I knew it wasn't the next day.

492
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,335
I knew that...

493
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,054
I recognized your voice.

494
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,649
How often were you in my room?

495
00:24:05,816 --> 00:24:07,950
No, you're wasting a question.

496
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:09,414
I have a better one.

497
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:12,552
Why steal my pad?

498
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:15,398
Oh, my God, you're right.
I'm an addict.

499
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:16,904
Thanks for opening my eyes.

500
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:18,787
No, I mean why my pad?

501
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,092
Foreman, Cameron
and Chase's pads
are just as convenient.

502
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:24,979
But their association
with you is involuntary,
they're employees.

503
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:26,862
I associate with you
through choice

504
00:24:26,904 --> 00:24:28,536
and any relationship
that involves choice

505
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:31,130
you have to see
how far you can push
before it breaks.

506
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:32,552
This is easy.

507
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:35,983
You ask the questions,
answer them
and make tasty snacks.

508
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:38,494
Let's go try the casino.

509
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,418
And one day
our friendship will break

510
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,724
and that'll just prove
your theory that relationships
are conditional

511
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:46,318
and you don't need
human connection
or deserve it,

512
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:49,540
or whatever goes on
in that
rat-maze of your brain.

513
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:51,590
Sorry, if I'd known
he was gonna be this annoying,

514
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:53,347
I would have stolen
Dr. Cameron's pad

515
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:55,021

At least she appreciates
my brooding melancholy.

00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,762
The patient's BP
just dropped like a stone.

Do an echo.

524
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:20,335
I was wrong.
Your son's still dying.

525
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:23,724
I need to go over
every relative
you ever had. Again.

526
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:26,904

forget their diseases,
just tell me how they died.

527

you get a big one at the end.

Does anyone in the kitchen
know the hoagie shop

535
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:51,130
that used to be
on St. James Place?

536
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:53,347
You sister-in-law
with the diabetes.

537
00:25:53,473 --> 00:25:55,314
As far as you know,
is she still alive?
She's not.

538
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:56,444
She was killed
in a traffic accident

539
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:58,033
driving home
from a Phillies game.

540
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,623
I'm sure a lot of beer
was consumed.

Your father?

542
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:03,640
Old age.

Hi, do you guys deliver?

546
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:12,762
Let me put it this way,

547
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:15,774
if you deliver, there'll be
a $100 tip in it for you.

548
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:17,992
Excellent.

549
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,381
Victory.
The night
is finally going my way.

550
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,640
Wilson, toss me a soda.

551
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:39,707
Shall we go somewhere
to talk?

552
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:41,841
House is an ass.

553
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,891
But he obviously needs
pain medication,

554
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:45,314
and how much pain
one person feels

555
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:47,741
is not a call
the government
should be making.

556
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:49,833
So you think
I'm a bureaucrat
with a badge

557
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,050
following
some arbitrary guideline.

558
00:26:52,636 --> 00:26:53,849
Yeah, I do.

559
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,494
So you're saying
I should just trust him.
Do you?

560
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,084
You're not qualified
to make that...

561
00:27:00,126 --> 00:27:02,008
I'm not sure
you are, either.

562
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,933
I've been a cop for 20 years.

563
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:05,063
And not a day goes by

564
00:27:05,063 --> 00:27:09,289
that someone doesn't try
to sell me
some self-serving story.

565
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,008
If you had my job,
you'd know.

566
00:27:13,347 --> 00:27:14,979
Everybody lies.

567
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,891
I think
you've run out of relatives.

568
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,192
So, it's my turn.

569
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:32,887
Why did you become a doctor?

570
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:34,393
That's the big question?

571
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,029
I give you complete license
to humiliate me

572
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,410
and that's the best
you can do.

573
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:41,423
Well, okay, let's discuss
the wonder of the human body.

574
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:43,640
No, no, no.
You're a curious guy.

575
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:46,987
You like to figure things out,
why not go into research?

576
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:48,619
Why work with people when you

577
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:51,004
obviously hate people?

578
00:27:52,594 --> 00:27:53,975
Oedipal fixation.

579
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,398
I was seeking
my mother's love

580
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,490
and she thought that Ben Casey
was just the dreamiest...

581
00:27:57,531 --> 00:28:00,962
Okay, fine. You don't think
you'll need
any more answers from me?

582
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:02,845
Give me a hard time.

583
00:28:11,716 --> 00:28:13,264
When I was 14,

584
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,736
my father was stationed
in Japan.

585
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,084
I went rock-climbing
with this kid from school.

586
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:23,389
He fell and got injured
and I had to bring him
to the hospital.

587
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:26,946
And we came in through
the wrong entrance

588
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:28,996
and passed this guy
in the hall.

589
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:31,799
He was a janitor.

590
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:34,017
My friend came down
with an infection

591
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,234
and the doctors didn't know
what to do.

592
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:38,452
So they brought in

593
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:41,423
the janitor.

594
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:45,649
He was a doctor.

00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,343
One of Japan's untouchables.

597
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:57,280
His ancestors
had been slaughterers,
gravediggers.

598
00:28:58,494 --> 00:28:59,665
And this guy,

599
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:04,059
he knew that he wasn't
accepted by the staff,
didn't even try.

600
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:07,197
He didn't dress well,
he didn't pretend
to be one of them.

601
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:10,293
The people around that place,

602
00:29:10,418 --> 00:29:12,929
they didn't think
he had anything they wanted,

603
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:16,946
except when they needed him.

604
00:29:18,243 --> 00:29:20,000
Because he was right.

605
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:24,184
Which meant
that nothing else mattered.

606
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,448
And they had to listen to him.

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,406

00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:16,151
Yeah. I'm sure
it's a stressful,

and gone to bed.

It was Christmas Eve.

I let Kyle pop corn
in the fireplace.

You just blame your son
for what happened.

I don't blame him.
He was a 12-year-old boy.

630
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:57,573
You don't blame a kid
for an accident.

631
00:30:57,699 --> 00:30:59,498
Then what are we doing here?
Why aren't you with him?

632
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:01,255
Because it wouldn't matter.

00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:00,586
so it only passes
through the mother.

He thinks that
he killed his mother

he's saying, "Kill me
and cut out my heart."

682
00:33:49,372 --> 00:33:51,255
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

683
00:33:52,427 --> 00:33:54,770
Fine.
I'll think of something else.

684
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:57,699
I'm sorry.

685
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:15,565
Wilson, get out.

686
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:19,791
No.

687
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:25,858
You lied to the cops
enough for me.

688
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,469
Maybe I don't wanna
push this till it breaks.

689
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:57,029
Pills are the simplest.

690
00:35:00,544 --> 00:35:03,054
Hanging has less chance
of damaging the heart.

691
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,201
I'm okay with pain.

692
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:12,510
Strangulation is better
than breaking your neck,

693
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,900
which means this'll be slow.

694
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:22,636
I wouldn't get to see him
even if we got in the car
right now

695
00:35:22,678 --> 00:35:25,649
and broke
the speed limit driving back,
would I?

696
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,657
No.

697
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,925
Tell him...

698
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:42,762
I don't know
what to tell him.

699
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:47,782
(SIGHS)

700
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,632
I think it's my turn
to ask a question, isn't it?

701
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:52,971
I don't think so.

702
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:56,485
'Cause you just asked me
that thing
about the speed limit.

703
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:00,921
What do you wanna know?

704
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:04,770
If you could hear one thing
from your father,
what would it be?

705
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:08,368
It wouldn't help you.

706
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:09,582
Try me.

707
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:16,360
I'd want him to say,

708
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:21,172
"You were right.

709
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,393
"You did the right thing."

710
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:29,456
Yeah. It doesn't help.

711
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,611
Hi.
Hi.

712
00:36:48,745 --> 00:36:50,167
I'm Dr. Wilson.

713
00:36:50,795 --> 00:36:52,385
I'm Mrs. Schaffer.

714
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:54,100
I'm from Princeton.

715
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:58,452
My husband and I
and our three children
live in Philadelphia.

716
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:05,858
So, do you like to swing?

717
00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:09,582
No.

718
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:12,971
Well, if you
change your mind, I'm in...

719
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,197
House? House?

720
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,707
Is it room 622, 642?

721
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:21,213
622.

722
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:22,845
622.

723
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:24,686
Yeah.

724
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:40,962
Alibi.

725
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:44,770
I figured.

726
00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:54,268
(THUMPING)

727
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:33,096
They found
an open bottle of aspirin
by the body.

728
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,912
Lucky he had a headache,
reduced trauma
to the heart in transit.

729
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,799
Lucky.

730
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:55,690
That can't be all.

731
00:38:57,155 --> 00:38:59,038
Well, you got a heart
out of it.

732
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:01,130
How many organs
do you want from the guy?

733
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,598
I mean, my father
must have said something.

734
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:05,900
He couldn't just...

735
00:39:05,983 --> 00:39:09,038
He must have given you
some kind of a message for me.

736
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,820
He said you were right.

737
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,870
You did the right thing.

738
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:25,649
Right about what?

739
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,121
What does that mean?

740
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:32,887
How would I know?
He's your dad.

741
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:47,992
You know
what I found interesting
about this case?

742
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:50,753
That it proved
that people
can love unconditionally

743
00:39:50,837 --> 00:39:52,469
and you can tell yourself
it's not true,

744
00:39:52,552 --> 00:39:54,979
but you'll just end up
in a hotel room
in Atlantic City

745
00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:56,611
asking someone
to cut your heart out?

746
00:39:56,653 --> 00:39:58,703
(MACHINE BEEPING)
The hoagie.

747
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:00,879
You thought this guy
was emotionally confused,

748
00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:02,678
and that the hoagie
was just a mask

749
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,272
to hide his real feelings
toward his son.

750
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:06,527
It was.

751
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,540
Did you know Tritter
was talking to your team
while we were away?

752
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,544
Yeah.

753
00:40:11,088 --> 00:40:12,427
And yet you moved
Heaven and Earth

754
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:15,356
to get him that mask
with mustard and prosciutto.

755
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:16,862
Which one of them told you?

756
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:17,908
All of them.

757
00:40:17,992 --> 00:40:20,586
Which means that none of them
said anything
I have to worry about.

758
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:21,841
(MACHINE BEEPING)
Back to the hoagie.

759
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:23,891
You think that
my addiction's out of hand.

760
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:27,741
Your need to be needed
is so strong that you'll
give people what they want,

761
00:40:27,782 --> 00:40:29,456
what they need,
what they think they need.

762
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,180
I don't think my enabling
is anything you should be
complaining about.

763
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,649
Yes, my name
is Dr. James Wilson,

764
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:38,828
account number 835687.

765
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:41,799
The ATM says
I've got zero...

766
00:40:43,473 --> 00:40:45,230
What does that mean, a hold?

767
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:50,209
Yeah, okay, thanks.

768
00:40:54,226 --> 00:40:55,398
(SIGHS)

769
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:59,289
My accounts have been frozen
as part of
a police investigation.

770
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,561
They can't keep
your money forever.

771
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:10,000
No, they can keep it
till I agree to help send
you to prison for 10 years.

772
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:16,862
You're getting dinner.
