1
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:15,468
<i>('ZAT YOU, SANTA CLAUS?
PLAYING)</i>

2
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:38,065
Merry Christmas.

3
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:40,650
And a happy go to hell.

4
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:43,694
What's he doing here?
Is he with you?

5
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,738
Detective Tritter and I...

6
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:49,239
We worked out a deal.

7
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:52,074
Already got a lawyer.
Get out of my office.

8
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:56,744
I told him I didn't write
those prescriptions.

9
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,412
I spoke with the DA.

10
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:04,457
He agreed to two months
in a rehab facility
in exchange for a guilty plea.

11
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,375
Get out of my office.

12
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:08,626
No jail time.

13
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,003
Right. So I should get
locked up in some place
I don't belong

14
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:13,421
in order to avoid getting
locked up in some other place
I don't belong.

15
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:16,173
I got you on forgery, fraud,
enough drugs to...

16
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:17,715
No sanctions
to the medical board.

17
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,174
And you get your car back

18
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:21,718
and your bank accounts
and your precious
tumor-ridden patients.

19
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,552
I did this to help you.

20
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:25,178
Next Christmas,
buy me a sweater.

21
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:26,846
You punched out an employee!

22
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:29,181
You nearly cut a little girl
in half because you were
too strung out...

23
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:30,765
I was in pain!

24
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:36,852
You need to believe
that I've got a problem

25
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:40,021
so that your betrayal
has the illusion of nobility.

26
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:42,272
But you just selfishly...
Knock it off.

27
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:45,316
Look, I don't care why
Dr. Wilson is doing this.

28
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,693
And right now,
it makes no difference
to you, either,

29
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,279
'cause you need to deal with
the reality of
your current situation.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,280
You want to
stand on principle,
you end up in a cell.

31
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:58,282
And you end up
never practicing
medicine again.

32
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:03,202
So you got two choices,
your principles or your life.

33
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,333
Get out of my office.

34
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,005
The DA put a clock
on the deal.

35
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,381
You got three days to decide.

36
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:07,242
House! Just give me a minute.
You're afraid of the pain.

37
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:08,660
You're not?

38
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:11,495
You can still have
pain meds in rehab.

39
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:13,621
Tramadol, gabapentin.
Those don't work.

40
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:15,622
They will once you're
weaned off the Vicodin.

41
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:18,582
Look, there's Jesus.
Better go tell the Romans.

42
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,334
Fine, run to Cuddy.

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,544
You don't think
she's going to support me
on this?

44
00:03:27,963 --> 00:03:31,924
Well, the stitches
are healing nicely,
there's no sign of infection.

45
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:33,342
Whoa.

46
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,635
Sorry.

47
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:39,637
Just need her
for a tiny moment.

48
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,597
Small favor.

49
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,015
Pills.

50
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,224
Who's the wit?

51
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:48,518
Doctor. Don't worry,
I'll be firing him soon.

52
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:50,352
Wait in my office.

53
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:53,438
Incision looks just big enough
for a chest tube.

54
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:56,606
Collapsed lung?
Someone mistake you
for a pinata?

55
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,484
Delightful. Usually
we just get the elf jokes
this time of year.

56
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:02,652
No on trauma.

57
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,736
Negative PPD.

58
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,071
What flavor dwarfs
are you guys?

59
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:10,406
My daughter and I both have
cartilage-hair hypoplasia.

60
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,907
Think you can make
a pun out of that?

61
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,868
Yes. But I don't
want to be insensitive.

62
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:18,120
She's got a bit
of a short fuse,
doesn't she?

63
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:21,872
It's a bleb.
Wait in my office.
Bleb's not a diagnosis,
it's an evasion.

64
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:23,623
We'll schedule
an MRI to make sure,

65
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,667
but a certain number
of these cases
are idiopathic.

66
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:29,252
Let me translate that
into Tolkien for you guys.

67
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,711
It means Dr. Cuddy's
got no idea

68
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:33,337
why your daughter's lung
suddenly popped
like a balloon.

69
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:34,964
You think you do?

70
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:39,258
Gimme her chart. And my pills.

71
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:43,677
Santa needs us.

72
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:48,972
Did you get that looked at?

73
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm fine.

74
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:54,601
Great. I just admitted
a cartilage-hair hypoplasia
dwarf.

75
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:57,144
Fifteen years old...
What are you going to do?

76
00:04:57,227 --> 00:05:01,021
I thought I'd get your
theories, mock them, then
embrace my own. The usual.

77
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:02,981
Wilson told us he ratted.

78
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:05,024
Your choice of verb,
I take it?

79
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:09,360
It's appropriate.
He betrayed you.
And you should take the deal.

80
00:05:10,486 --> 00:05:14,196
Unexplained lung collapse
and anemia. Cuddy thinks
it's idiopathic.

81
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,157
"Cuddy" and "idiop"
being the relevant parts
of that sentence.

82
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,408
Well, I'd say TB,
but Cuddy's
already ruled it out.

83
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,201
Then you'd be just as big
an idiop as her.

84
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:22,535
Don't you people know
your dwarfs?

85
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,828
There are over 200 varieties
of dwarfism,

86
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,371
each with different
medical complications.

87
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:29,081
You can't expect us
to be intimately familiar
with all of them?

88
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:30,957
The sick dwarfs
sure expect you to.

89
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:34,334
Cartilage-hair hypoplasia.
They have compromised
immune systems.

90
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,210
Gold star for Cameron.

91
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,419
For extra credit,

92
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,962
explain to the special needs
section of the class

93
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:41,213
why our patient's negative
TB test is irrelevant.

94
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:43,798
A PPD involves
planting a fragment of TB
under the skin

95
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:45,549
to see if the immune system
recognizes it.

96
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:47,425
Because of
a compromised immune system,

97
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,552
our patient could have TB
but not recognize it.

98
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:51,595
The little people love you.

99
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:53,513
Let's go see a dwarf
about a gallium scan.

100
00:05:57,765 --> 00:05:59,266
Gallium
is a radioactive isotope.

101
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:00,517
It travels through your veins,

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,519
allowing us to see
any bright spots
that might indicate infection.

103
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,439
I'm 4'1".
That's 1.5 canes in metric.

104
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:12,233
You don't look
a day over four feet.

105
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:15,568
I saw in the file that her dad
was normal-sized.

106
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,194
It's average-sized.

107
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,571
Compared to you,
I'm sure it was huge.

108
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:21,030
So did he have a fetish,

109
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,782
or did he just fall in love
with your long-legged soul?

110
00:06:23,823 --> 00:06:27,117
He grew up in the circus.
Said I reminded him of home.

111
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,368
Seems like you're the one
with the fetish.

112
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:32,078
I'm certainly curious
about the logistics.

113
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:33,454
Did you stand on a table?

114
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,580
House!

115
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:38,499
Pretty much,
he'd lay flat and spin me.

116
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,583
Mom.

117
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,877
So, Abigail, you want to
hop up on the table for me?

118
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:46,546
That's going to be tough.

119
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,548
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me give you a boost.

120
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:51,841
Stop treating her
like she's five.

121
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:53,842
Just bring over a stool
and let her climb up herself.

122
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,343
Mom, it's okay.

123
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:57,719
I was just trying
to be helpful.

124
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:01,055
She also hates Jews.

125
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,056
I've dealt with worse.

126
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,683
Being different,
you get used to
people's idiocy.

127
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:08,935
Still beats the hell out of
actually being an idiot.

128
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:11,978
What?

129
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:15,064
Care to go for a spin?

130
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,484
What the hell
were you thinking?

131
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,944
You didn't think ratting out
this hospital's best doctor

132
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:26,029
merited checking
with your boss first?

133
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,988
I didn't rat him out.
I got him a deal.

134
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,197
Which he'll never take.

135
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,782
He will if we...
How long have you known House?

136
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,533
Did you think
he'd suddenly become
reasonable?

137
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:35,827
I made the deal. It's done.
You can either
keep yelling at me,

138
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:37,536
or you can help me avoid
a complete disaster.

139
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:40,038
It already is going to be
a complete disaster!

140
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:42,789
He's not going to take
the deal. He's going
to go to jail.

141
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,124
Because he's a child,
he's too stubborn.

142
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,334
When a child misbehaves,
what do you do?

143
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,210
You take away something
he loves.

144
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,586
We can't take away
his Vicodin.

145
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,379
Not only will he be in pain,
he'll start to detox.

146
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:56,173
And we tell him the only way
to get the pills back
is to take the deal.

147
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:57,423
He won't be able to function.

148
00:07:57,465 --> 00:07:58,466
That's the point.

149
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:01,301
You going to explain that
to his patient?

150
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,136
What choice do we have?

151
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,974
Gallium scan shows
no bright spots
of any kind.

152
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:13,892
Means it's not TB
or any other infection.

153
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,852
There are no bright spots
'cause the whole thing's
too bright.

154
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:18,603
Except for the liver.

155
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,563
The tech over-exposed
the image a bit,
but it's nothing.

156
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:22,731
The liver looks fine.

157
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,524
Could be lung cancer.

158
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,359
Tumor causes
structural damage.
The lung caves in on itself.

159
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,735
Also explains the anemia.

160
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,444
Doesn't explain
the liver problem, though.

161
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,654
Her lung collapsed.
There is no liver problem.

162
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:34,238
Did you guys look at the liver
on this thing?

163
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:35,531
There's no liver problem.

164
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:36,948
Seriously, look at the liver.

165
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,866
There's nothing there.
HOUSE: Why not?

166
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:40,117
Because there's nothing wrong?

167
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,494
Every organ in this scan
is lit up like
a hundred-watt bulb.

168
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:46,871
Except for her liver,
which is hovering around
60 watts.

169
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:49,539
And not one of them
good 60-watters,
but an energy saving...

170
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:52,166
You're saying her liver's
shutting down
because the lighting is off?

171
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,875
You just don't want
a cancer diagnosis,

172
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,376
because then you'd have
to deal with Wilson.

173
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,503
Lung cancer
is a lame diagnosis.

174
00:08:57,586 --> 00:08:59,879
Avoiding Wilson
is an added bonus.

175
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:01,797
House, we need to talk.

176
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,257
Not taking the deal.
Glad we talked.

177
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,425
Ultrasound her liver.

178
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:07,884
Sit down.

179
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:09,427
Stand up.

180
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:10,886
Your turn.

181
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:12,637
House, you're off the case.

182
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,263
Your treatment privileges
are suspended

183
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,889
until you accept
Tritter's deal.

184
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,307
Well, I'm obviously
not going to take the deal

185
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,600
just so I can have the fun
of treating a dwarf.

186
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:22,143
So, I assume
there's more to this threat.

187
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:24,811
I'm also cutting off
your Vicodin.
That could work.

188
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:27,396
I'm taking over as attending.
Get an MRI of her lungs.

189
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,772
This is not lung cancer.

190
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:31,774
We'll find out as soon as
we MRI her lungs.

191
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:40,196
You're going to come
begging me
to save this girl

192
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,281
long before I come
begging you for pills.

193
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:44,699
I hope not.

194
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:47,200
For everyone's sake.

195
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,331
This is wrong.

196
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:59,666
Cutting House off?
It might not work,
but it's not wrong.

197
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,626
Bone windows look clean.

198
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,962
Abigail, we need you
to hold still, okay?

199
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:07,505
<i>Can I come out?</i>

200
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,464
Just hang in there
two more minutes,
and we'll be done.

201
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:10,548
Okay.

202
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,341
Because it's effective
doesn't make it right.

203
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:16,177
Cuddy's bending the rules
to get a patient
to do the right thing.

204
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,720
Who would work
for a doctor like that?
And the ends
justify the means?

205
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:21,639
If the ends involve
us keeping our jobs, sure.

206
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:26,266
Lung parenchyma's clean.
No masses,
it's not lung cancer.

207
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:27,809
<i>(ABIGAIL COUGHING)</i>

208
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:29,477
Abigail, you okay?

209
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:39,316
House was right.
Her liver's failing.

210
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,652
Endoscopy confirmed
the vomiting was caused
by variceal bleeding.

211
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:45,362
Blood work also confirms
House's hypothesis.

212
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,530
I get it. House was right,
it's the liver. Let's move on.

213
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:51,282
What causes liver disease
and a collapsed lung?

214
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:54,659
Schistosomiasis,
the parasite could have...
There's no eosinophilia.

215
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:57,786
Cirrhosis could explain...
Could be a hepatoma.

216
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:00,538
She's 15.
It's not liver cancer.

217
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:02,998
It's not unheard of.

218
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:05,166
Cirrhosis fits better.
The question is,
what caused it?

219
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,585
Could be hepatitis,
Budd-Chiari...
Or drugs and alcohol.

220
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,253
If anyone has reason
to dull the pain,
it's a teenage dwarf.

221
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,670
I'll do a liver biopsy
to confirm.

222
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:16,173
And I'll search
the patient's home
for drugs and alcohol.

223
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,758
Cameron, got a moment?

224
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:28,972
What exactly
is your problem with me?

225
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:31,641
Hepatoma is a weak diagnosis.

226
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,517
So this is all about the case?

227
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,601
What else would it be about?

228
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:40,271
I made this deal to help him.

229
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:42,522
And helped yourself
at the same time.

230
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:45,191
This is not about my practice.
This is not about my car.

231
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:48,276
I gave both of them up
to help House and I would
have gone on without them,

232
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,320
if he hadn't almost maimed
that little girl and if he
hadn't punched out Chase.

233
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:53,196
Was it an easy choice?

234
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:55,447
Of course not. But it's right.

235
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,365
Then why wasn't it easy?

236
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,116
Because he's my friend.

237
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:02,702
It's obviously complicated...
It's complicated?

238
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:06,246
When you decided to talk
to Tritter, your life got
a million times better.

239
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,414
How do you separate that out?

240
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:12,374
How do you pretend your
windfall isn't relevant
to this decision?

241
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,252
It was the right thing to do.

242
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:21,255
You pretending your motives
are pure is why
I have a problem.

243
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:34,555
Where's Cuddy?

244
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:39,266
In this drawer. It's a rescue
mission. I've got it under
control, you can leave.

245
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:43,019
You were right
about the liver failure,

246
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:45,520
the patient had variceal
bleeding, which suggested
cirrhosis, but...

247
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:47,104
Off the clock.

248
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,981
You predicted this.
You obviously saw something.

249
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:50,356
Obviously.

250
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:55,235
Liver biopsy was negative
for cirrhosis but it showed
sclerosing cholangitis.

251
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:58,278
Even weirder,
there's no increase
in alkaline phosphatase.

252
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,072
Medical mystery.
Sounds like the kind of thing
I'd be good at.

253
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:07,826
Breaking and entering
sounds like the kind of thing
you'd be good at.

254
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:11,203
I take it that's where
Cuddy's been keeping
your pills.

255
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:13,496
One theory, one drawer.

256
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,083
Really?

257
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,668
I thought you'd be all for
this "torture House" plan.

258
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:24,253
It works, therefore it's good.

259
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:26,045
On the other hand,
I don't want to talk you
out of this deal

260
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,296
by pointing out
your hypocrisy.

261
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:30,798
So, patient's life at stake,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

262
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,384
Forget about the specific
nature of the liver
dysfunction, it's irrelevant.

263
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:37,261
The dwarf's problem is global,
that's why the gallium scan
was bright.

264
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:39,887
And it's going to spread
throughout her entire body
unless you stop it.

265
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:43,181
If that were true, more than
her lungs and liver
would be affected.

266
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,307
It will be.

267
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,767
It'll spread through
the biliary tree
and hit her pancreas next.

268
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:49,685
Stop retracing your steps,
get ahead of it.

269
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:53,187
Forget the liver
and focus on the pancreas
because after that...

270
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:54,897
Actually, after that
it doesn't really matter
what it hits

271
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:58,191
because, pretty much,
all roads lead
to a dead dwarf.

272
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,026
I get why you
don't want to go to rehab.

273
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:04,945
But only an idiot
goes to prison
for being stubborn.

274
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:08,947
Only an idiot stands between
Ahab and his whale. Move.

275
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:20,371
Sorry.

276
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:30,169
Santa's got gifts.

277
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:33,713
Olive oil wasn't
in the kitchen, it was
in the medicine cabinet.

278
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:34,963
Home remedy
for ear infections.

279
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:37,340
Ear infections
are fairly typical
among CHH dwarfs.

280
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:39,049
Or, it's a symptom.

281
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:41,051
Certainly wouldn't indicate
a pancreatic problem.

282
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:43,677
Or House is wrong
and it's a symptom.

283
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:47,013
Laxatives. I don't think
they were used to maintain
her girlish figure.

284
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,056
Again, intestinal problems
are common.

285
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,182
Again, it might be a symptom.

286
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,725
Glucosamine
suggests chronic joint pain.

287
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,644
Who ordered
an alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency test?

288
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:57,936
I did.

289
00:14:58,145 --> 00:14:59,646
You think the problem's
in her pancreas?

290
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:02,147
I think it will be.
I think we need
to forget about the liver.

291
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:05,107
We just forgot about
the lungs, now we need
to forget about the liver?

292
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:08,568
We need to stop retracing
our steps and get ahead
of this thing.

293
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:12,070
House, you've tanned.

294
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,530
You don't think
I could have come up
with this?

295
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:15,822
Did you?

296
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:18,324
You suspended House because
it'd be dangerous
having him in charge,

297
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:19,366
but getting his opinion?

298
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,785
I'm sure he gave you that
opinion simply because he was
worried about the patient?

299
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:25,620
Just because House wants
his pills, doesn't mean
his theory is wrong.

300
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:28,997
No, the test results
mean that.
Your test was negative.

301
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:31,249
And the biopsy indicated
severe duct inflammation.

302
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:34,084
Do an ERCP
to check the liver
for bile duct cancer.

303
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,086
Just because it wasn't alpha-1
doesn't mean the pancreas
isn't next.

304
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,712
You needed an organ,
he needed a fix.

305
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:43,340
He'd have made up any story
for a pill. You didn't give
him anything, did you?

306
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:44,382
No.

307
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,345
(EXCLAIMS)

308
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:56,014
There's no bruise or nothing,
but it really hurts.

309
00:15:56,098 --> 00:16:00,017
Unfortunately, that pain
and lack of bruising is
typical of a zygomatic break.

310
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:02,477
Sounds bad.

311
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,561
Bones are aligned properly.

312
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:06,104
Which ER did you go to
after the car accident?

313
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:09,523
Princeton Plainsboro.
Here's my discharge slip.

314
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:11,440
Okay.

315
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,900
I'm going to get you some
acetaminophen with codeine.

316
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:16,402
I tried that,
it makes me nauseous.

317
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,737
There's a drug
called gabapentin

318
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:22,364
which is good
for certain kinds of pain.
Great!

319
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:23,907
'Cause I haven't slept
in days.

320
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,116
Gabapentin's not really
going to help with the sleep.

321
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,159
Oh.

322
00:16:27,742 --> 00:16:30,369
Is there something else
you can give me?

323
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:35,539
Vicodin's your best bet
with sleep issues.
Well, thanks so much.

324
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:39,708
Unfortunately, our policy
forbids prescribing opiates
to new patients.

325
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,543
Well, how could a clinic
have a rule
against relieving pain?

326
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,378
Just with opiates.
We find that it helps
weed out drug-seekers.

327
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,797
You think I'm a drug-seeker?
I'm not saying that.

328
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:49,798
Well, then give me
the Vicodin.
I can't.

329
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:51,340
Because you think
I'm a drug-seeker.

330
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:52,466
I just said I didn't.

331
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:55,676
No, you said that the policy
was to stop drug-seeking.

332
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,470
Then you said
I'm not a drug-seeker.
Policy doesn't apply.

333
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:00,638
I'm sorry, that's the policy.

334
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:02,556
Gabapentin works on
nerve damage.

335
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,599
You're prescribing it
for a broken face.

336
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,850
Might as well hand out
Band-Aids
for a severed carotid.

337
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:07,976
You're a doctor.

338
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,436
Not by
this clinic's definition,
since I'm neither a moron,

339
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,895
nor a mindless drone!

340
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,105
Security.
Forget it.

341
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:16,022
I'll throw myself out.

342
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:23,777
That tube is going
all the way down to my liver?

343
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:26,029
Don't worry,
you'll be sedated.

344
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,863
Sometimes doctors
have to do things

345
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,281
that make
people uncomfortable
to help them.

346
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,616
But we always want to respect
the patient's wishes

347
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,368
and not shove things down
their throats.

348
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:38,662
Foreman.

349
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:42,080
You haven't given
her the sedative.

350
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:43,123
No.

351
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,749
Abigail.

352
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,458
Abigail.

353
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:47,709
She's unconscious.

354
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,919
Check her airway.

355
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:52,754
Airway's clear.

356
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,130
Her breath smells fruity.

357
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:56,214
Diabetic ketoacidosis.

358
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:58,924
Hang an insulin drip
at.1 mgs per kg per hour!

359
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:02,218
Her pancreas is failing.
You ready to call House yet?

360
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:04,053
(SIGHS)

361
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:12,933
You were right.
The patient's pancreas
is failing.

362
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,934
Told you you'd come
begging me for help.

363
00:18:15,018 --> 00:18:17,186
Her insulin production
is almost non-existent.

364
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:21,272
Give me my pills
or lose an arm.

365
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:22,939
The girl is dying!
So give me my pills.

366
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:24,982
Take the deal and I will.

367
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,652
You'd rather kill this girl
than give me my pills?

368
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,695
I would rather lose
one patient now

369
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,906
than the dozens we will lose
while you're in prison.

370
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:41,451
Well, have fun explaining that
to her itsy-bitsy
grieving mother.

371
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:50,206
What if we sacrifice this girl
and House still goes to jail?

372
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:52,750
I'd feel bad.
Can we get on with this?

373
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,542
House correctly predicted
the spread,

374
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:58,003
means we've got a global
systemic illness affecting
lungs, liver and pancreas.

375
00:18:58,128 --> 00:18:59,420
So far. Ideas?

376
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:02,589
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
attacks multiple organ
systems.

377
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:05,799
Histiocytosis usually starts
in the brain, then moves
to the internal organs.

378
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,426
Abigail's brain is fine.
Cystic fibrosis.

379
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:09,844
Exocrine function's normal.

380
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:13,388
Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's a
systemic cancer, which her
dwarfism predisposes her to.

381
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:15,556
You have any ideas
that aren't cancer?
Cancer fits.

382
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:16,640
Autoimmune fits better.

383
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,057
We should treat her
with prednisone for lupus.

384
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,142
That'll spike her blood sugar
and put her back in a coma.

385
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,101
It's much safer just to run
a double-stranded DNA test.

386
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:24,686
Not if she dies before
we get the results.

387
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:25,895
One of you is probably right.

388
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:28,439
Why don't we hold the sniping
until we find out which?

389
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:32,733
Wilson, do an LP for lymphoma,
you guys run an antibody test
for lupus.

390
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:41,613
Because of your daughter's
dwarfism, we've had to pick
a higher entry point

391
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:43,781
for the lumbar puncture,
which increases the risk.

392
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:45,824
So, why not do
the lupus test first?

393
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:49,660
In the interest of time,
we think it's best
to proceed on both fronts.

394
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:51,995
You have no idea
what's wrong with my daughter.

395
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:54,913
We have several theories.
What does Dr. House think?

396
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:57,332
He's... He had to
go home sick.

397
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:00,334
My daughter may be dying
and he's gone home
with the sniffles?

398
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,459
Well, he's not...

399
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:04,419
He was the only one who seemed
to have any idea
what was wrong with her.

400
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,796
He better be
really damn sick.

401
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:07,922
He is.

402
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:14,676
HOUSE: Unless you've got
Vicodin, go away.

403
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:17,428
House, it's me, I...

404
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:21,805
Oh, God.

405
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,724
I don't have...
No pills?

406
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,767
No eggnog.

407
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,978
What happened to your arm?

408
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:34,230
Cut myself.

409
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:41,109
Wilson was wrong
about lymphoma.

410
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:44,111
Kid's not losing any weight,
no night sweats.

411
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:46,029
Cuddy send you?
No.

412
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:49,031
She doesn't trust me
not to give you pills.

413
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:51,074
Is she right?

414
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:53,825
House, these cuts
are straight, in a row.

415
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:56,744
You did this on purpose.

416
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:02,581
Cutting releases endorphins,
endorphins relieve pain.

417
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:05,082
You going to get me
some pills?

418
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,583
No.

419
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:09,669
Well, then you can leave.

420
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,878
No constitutional
symptoms means...

421
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:15,547
As soon as the kid gets cured,
Cuddy's got
no pressure to fold.

422
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:18,507
You really think
she's going to fold?

423
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,054
Autoimmune fits better
than cancer.

424
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:30,431
But lupus loves kidneys.
Usually attacks them first.

425
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,141
Kidneys are fine, right?

426
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,308
Yeah.

427
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,684
House,

428
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:36,769
take the deal.

429
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,436
You can survive
without Vicodin.

430
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,355
After you were shot,
you stayed clean for months.

431
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:42,356
Yeah.

432
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,732
I wonder if it had something
to do with
the absence of pain.

433
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:48,026
Leave that. I want to be able
to pour alcohol on it
so I can distract myself.

434
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,444
Then you can rip off
the bandage.

435
00:21:55,822 --> 00:21:57,240
Kid been sick lately?

436
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,700
There's a history
of ear infections.

437
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:04,369
See, Abigail's immune system

438
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:07,955
is like a shy guy in a bar.

439
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,416
The ear infections,
they come in
and they try to coax him to...

440
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,044
To hell with the metaphor.

441
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,462
You get the point, right?

442
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,963
Nerd gets drunk,
trashes the bar.

443
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:24,090
One of the autoimmunes
triggered by
a minor infection?

444
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:27,092
Factor in her age,
elevated sed rate, anemia...

445
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:29,927
It's Still's disease.

446
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:34,055
We start her on prednisone,
methotrexate, cyclosporin.

447
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:36,223
House.

448
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:38,641
Stop this.

449
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,767
Please.

450
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,658
What'd he say?
Still's disease.

451
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:06,950
It's chronic,
but manageable...

452
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:08,993
A diagnosis
that's virtually unconfirmable

453
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:13,413
and with a treatment that's
more dangerous than what we
were considering for lupus.

454
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:15,205
How bad is he?

455
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:16,498
Are you asking
because you care

456
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:19,416
or because you're wondering
whether to trust his opinion?

457
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,584
Both.

458
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:23,044
He's detoxing. In agony.

459
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:25,795
He's started cutting himself.

460
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:28,881
But he's still House.

461
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:33,383

You can write me a scrip

They'd give me that in rehab.

479
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:45,387
Then you should go to rehab.

480
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:47,430
I have a patient.

ear infections, or you just
wrote it off as a dwarf thing?

505
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:28,910
How's the girl?

506
00:26:28,993 --> 00:26:30,327
Much better.

507
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:33,037
House was right.

508
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:34,455
It happens.

509
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:37,957
I thought
we could handle this.

510
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,292
Still's disease
never crossed my mind.

511
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:43,377
Don't beat yourself up,
I didn't get it, either.

512
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:54,801
(CHUCKLES)

513
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:57,011
I feel like a mob informant.

514
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:02,639
You want to go inside?
Got a cafeteria
in there, right?

515
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:05,016
I can't testify.

516
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,644
Drug addicts hurt the people
around them with their habit.

517
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:13,980
House has hurt
plenty of people.
You included.

518
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:17,148
He saves lives.
People that no one else
can save.

519
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:20,817
And, no matter how much
of an ass he is,

520
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:24,528
statistically, House
is a positive force
in the universe.

521
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:27,613
Pills let him do that.

522
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:31,074
Vicodin does not make House
a genius.

523
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:34,534
Whatever he does on the pills,
he can do off.

524
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,244
He is just not willing to try.

525
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,288
I won't testify against him.

526
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,207
Then we'll subpoena you.

527
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,334
Your previous statement
will be read into evidence

528
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:52,045
and you'll be charged
with interfering
with an investigation.

529
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,589
And you will go to jail.

530
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,593
Again, statistically,

531
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:04,678
better me than him.

532
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,013
Statistically, the two of you
will be in jail.

533
00:28:42,743 --> 00:28:43,911
Dr. Cameron?

534
00:28:43,952 --> 00:28:45,995
Come quick,
there's something wrong
with Abby.

535
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:48,080
It can't be too severe,
her cardiac alarm
didn't go off.

536
00:28:48,163 --> 00:28:50,540
It's not her heart.
She's bleeding.

537
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,835
Picking up a scrip
under Zebalusky.

538
00:29:01,588 --> 00:29:04,424
This is Dr. Wilson's patient.

539
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:07,384
Yeah. Wilson's busy right now.

540
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:12,595
What with Mr. Zebalusky dying
in agony on account
of his metastatic lung cancer

541
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,638
and not having the pills
to relieve that agony

542
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,973
because of some
moron pharmacist.

543
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,225
Sign the book.

544
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:51,161
The bleeding wasn't a ruptured
eardrum, ear infection
or bleeding disorder.

545
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:53,246
Her heart rate's climbing,
blood pressure's dropping,

546
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,956
she's on the verge
of a multi-system failure.

547
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:58,749
Head CT was clean,
means it's not
a neurological problem.

548
00:29:58,833 --> 00:29:59,833
Basically we have nothing.

549
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,543
The cancer's
still on the table.

550
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,586
Spinal fluid
was negative for lymphoma.

551
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,711
What other...
Leukemia.

552
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:06,129
We need to do
a bone marrow biopsy.

553
00:30:06,212 --> 00:30:07,713
None of the blood tests
suggest leukemia.

554
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:09,673
Cancer doesn't explain
the collapsed lung.

555
00:30:09,756 --> 00:30:11,966
Unless a small clot
led to a pulmonary infarct.

556
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,050
It's a long shot.
Autoimmune is way more likely.

557
00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:15,968
Autoimmune diseases
respond to steroids,
which we've given her.

558
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,053
And she got better
for a while, we stopped
the treatment too soon.

559
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:19,137
Because she crashed.

560
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,431
All we're doing is bouncing
back and forth between cancer
and autoimmune.

561
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:25,307
We're going in circles.

562
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,521
Give me half an hour.

563
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:36,981

00:30:42,193 --> 00:30:44,069
Can I have a French fry?

566
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:46,321
Get your own.

567
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:48,197
You took the last ones.

568
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:50,698
What's wrong with you?

569
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,408
I've got spinal
muscular atrophy.

570
00:30:55,034 --> 00:30:57,077
I guess it's not contagious.

571
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,662
Nice bear.

572
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:01,372
It's a dog.

573
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:03,873
House, it's not Still's.

574
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:08,251
Steroids helped until
the patient started bleeding
from the ears and mouth.

575
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:10,419
It's a bear.

576
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:12,795
His name is Bill. He's a dog.

577
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,756
You win, you can have Vicodin.

578
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:18,758
Words have set meanings
for a reason.

579
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:21,051
If you see an animal like Bill
and you try to play fetch,

580
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,260
Bill's going to eat you.

581
00:31:22,343 --> 00:31:23,636
Because Bill's a bear.

582
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:25,428
Are you on something?

583
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:28,722
You got your hands
on pain meds.

584
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,682
Bill has fur,
four legs, and a collar.

585
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,558
He's a dog.

586
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,643
It's between cancer
and autoimmune.

587
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:38,061
See, that's what we call
a faulty syllogism.

588
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:41,397
Just because you call Bill
a dog, doesn't mean that he is

589
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:44,273
a dog.

590
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:52,112
We got to x-ray
our patient's leg.

591
00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:56,865
Her leg looks fine.

592
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,282
Weird, huh?

00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:00,117

What... What...

596
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:05,829
Normal's not normal
if you're not normal.

597
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:07,746
Did you just take a pill?

598
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,830
No.

599
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:12,499
So how does a dwarf have
completely normal
growth plates?

600
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:15,626
It's impossible.
We must be missing something.

601
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,461
How many pills have you taken?

602
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:19,170
Not nearly as many
as I'm going to take.

603
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:21,755
I'd forgotten how delicious
they were.

604
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:23,006
I didn't give them to him.

605
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:25,466
Can we forget my vices,
get back to my virtues?

606
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:26,758
We were missing the fact that

607
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:30,052
just because we called her
a dwarf doesn't mean
she is a dwarf.

608
00:32:30,094 --> 00:32:32,012
Everyone assumed she was,
because of her mother.

609
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:33,763
There's no test
for CHH dwarfism,

610
00:32:33,804 --> 00:32:36,848
so she lost an identity,
but we gained a symptom.

611
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:40,100
If she doesn't have
skeletal dwarfism,

612
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:44,228
then her short stature must be
caused by a growth
hormone deficiency.

613
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:46,312
And something's wrong
with her pituitary gland

614
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:48,272
and based on her size,
it's been wrong for a while.

615
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:51,190
So what connects
a long-term pituitary issue

616
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:54,234
with problems in the lungs,
liver and pancreas?

617
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:57,903
You guys and your bickering.
Cancer versus autoimmune.

618
00:32:57,944 --> 00:32:59,529
Obviously, you think
it's something else.

619
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:02,239
Nope. I think it's both.

620
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:04,490
Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

621
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,824
Also known as,

622
00:33:05,908 --> 00:33:08,868
"You got your cancer
in my autoimmune" disease.

623
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:11,119
The immune component responded
to the Still's treatment,

624
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:12,412
led to the short-term
improvement.

625
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:13,788
The cancer portion didn't.

626
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:16,498
We dismissed this earlier,
because there were no
neurological symptoms.

627
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:18,958
Yeah. It's not your fault.

628
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,793
The only neurological symptom
was her height.

629
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,669
Who could have noticed?

630
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:34,467
This is your pituitary gland.

631
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:37,344
This is the granuloma
that's been crushing it.

632
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:41,347
No pituitary equals
no growth hormone,
equals about that much.

633
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,765
She's not a dwarf?

634
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:46,058
Just hormonally challenged.

635
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,934
What about my mom?

636
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:51,686
Your mom's the real deal.
But you're just
a tiny little poseur.

637
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:54,105
Your recent ear infections
caused your body to release

638
00:33:54,146 --> 00:33:56,523
a cascade of the same cells
that made the granuloma.

639
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:58,441
They attacked your lungs,
moved on to your liver,

640
00:33:58,524 --> 00:34:00,567
then hitched a ride over
to your pancreas.

641
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,443
We can nuke them
with a mild course of chemo

642
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:04,653
and then remove the granuloma.

643
00:34:04,695 --> 00:34:07,488
And then what?
What will happen to her then?

644
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:11,282
Well, let me see
if I can make this clear.

645
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:13,617
This pill represents

646
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:15,535
a pill.

647
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:18,620
And my mouth represents
your daughter's mouth.

648
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:22,205
We deposit the pill
in the mouth.

649
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:29,960
You may never be tall enough
to play in the WNBA,

650
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:33,171
but you should be able to
post up your mom, no problem.

651
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,047
What if I
don't take the pills?

652
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:41,009
What if you remove the thing
in my head and give me
the chemo, but not the pills?

653
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:42,176
Would I still get better?

654
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,845
Your body needs growth hormone
for lots of things.

655
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:46,054
Like

656
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:47,430
to grow.

657
00:34:47,763 --> 00:34:49,514
I like who I am now.

658
00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:52,141
Nobody your age
likes who they are now.

659
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:53,350
I do.

660
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,228
You like needing help
when you want something
off a high shelf?

661
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:00,479
Not being able to press
an elevator button
above the eighth floor?

662
00:35:00,563 --> 00:35:03,356
Having to smell ass
every time you stand in line?

663
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,107
You don't need growth hormone.

664
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:07,984
It's just your ticket
out of the freak show.

665
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:22,868
Can't you deliver a diagnosis

666
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:25,328
without making her feel
that her life
isn't worth living?

667
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,788
I'm trying to help her.

668
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:29,164
You're trying
to make her taller.

669
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:30,665
Not too tall.

670
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:33,500
Just tall enough
to wipe her own butt.

671
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:37,878
Are you high?

672
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,462
Higher than you.

673
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,506
If my daughter doesn't want
to choose the easy path,

674
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:43,673
I won't force her to.

675
00:35:43,756 --> 00:35:45,716
Then you're a lousy mom.

676
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:47,300
You want your daughter
to be a freak.

677
00:35:47,342 --> 00:35:48,968
We're not freaks.

678
00:35:49,343 --> 00:35:51,428
You want her to overcome
adversity.

679
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:53,596
Yes.
Then why stop at height?

680
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,806
Poke a stick in her eye.
Imagine how interesting
she'll be then.

681
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,432
Being little
is not the same as...

682
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:01,601
You and I have found out
that being normal sucks.

683
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:03,394
Because we're freaks.

684
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:07,480
The advantage of being a freak
is it makes you stronger.

685
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:10,773
Now, how strong
do you really want her
to have to be?

686
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:15,401
You told her
what you had to tell her.

687
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:17,486
Now you tell her you lied.

688
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:21,030
Even if you didn't.

689
00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:30,244
This is who
you were supposed to be.

690
00:36:30,494 --> 00:36:32,037
You hate normal.

691
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,122
It's not that simple.

692
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,707
If I grow,
I'll fade into the background.

693
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,208
I'll be boring.

694
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:45,712
We'll get you a funny hat.

695
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:51,257
You could never be boring.

696
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:55,218
You want me
to be like everybody else?

697
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,930
I want you to have
what I can't.

698
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,984
Abigail agreed...

699
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:23,986
Abigail agreed
to take growth hormone.

700
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:25,653
Who's Abigail?

701
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,238
Your non-dwarf dwarf patient.

702
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,364
Good.

703
00:37:30,823 --> 00:37:33,283
Then the growth hormone
makes sense.

704
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:35,952
Christmas Eve.

705
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:37,453
Yeah, I know.

706
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,829
Deal expires tomorrow.

707
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:41,914
You have plans for tonight?

708
00:37:41,997 --> 00:37:44,916
You worried I'm going to be
popping more pills?

709
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,376
Thought you might prefer
people over pills.

710
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,603
Hey, Mom.

711
00:38:18,853 --> 00:38:21,855
I guess you guys
are already up
at Aunt Sarah's.

712
00:38:23,857 --> 00:38:25,107
I'm sure Dad's in the eggnog

713
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:28,901
and you're probably suffering
through another
dried-out turkey.

714
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:38,449
I just wanted to say,
"Merry Christmas."

715
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:03,965
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

716
00:39:05,341 --> 00:39:06,466
WILSON: House?

717
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,969
Are you okay?
I called three times.

718
00:39:58,416 --> 00:39:59,375
(DOOR CLOSING)

719
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:16,302
<i>(HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY
LITTLE CHRISTMAS PLAYING)</i>

720
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,181
I'm ready to take the deal.

721
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,350
Well, that's off the table.

722
00:40:28,518 --> 00:40:31,645
The clock
doesn't expire until...
Got new evidence.

723
00:40:31,728 --> 00:40:33,896
We don't need Wilson anymore.

724
00:40:34,355 --> 00:40:36,773
Thing about addicts is,

725
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:40,484
no matter how smart they are,

726
00:40:40,817 --> 00:40:43,652
they are dumb
when it comes to drugs.

727
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:47,029
So, I've been keeping an eye
on the pharmacy log.

728
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:51,032
Seems some patient of Wilson's
named Zebalusky,

729
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:56,160
managed to pick up
his Oxy prescription
after he died.

730
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:00,204
(CHUCKLES)

731
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:05,416
Jesus walks, huh?

732
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:14,838
Merry Christmas.
