1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,963
I'm okay. Let's just go home.

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,924
You're getting checked out.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,552
I tripped on the ice.
Eight other kids tripped.
This is embarrassing.

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,096
You said you were just gonna
hang with your friends.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,350
I turn around,
and you're out there
on the ice.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,601
I'm fine.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,186
You don't know that.

8
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,563
You fell awkwardly.

9
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:22,814
No, I didn't.

10
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,191
You don't know how to fall.

11
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,109
I'm 16.
I've been falling a lot.

12
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,238
I think I'm getting
the hang of it. And I checked.

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,031

14
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,324
<i>(MUSIC STOPS)</i>

15
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,451
And now the doctors
are gonna check.

16
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,745
You don't think that
you're overreacting?

17
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,872
I don't need you
to fix every booboo.

18
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,249
Then stop getting them.

19
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,543
I was just playing around
with my friends.
I was having fun.

20
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,919
You know you can't do that.

21
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,170
Oh, I can't have fun.

22
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:49,508
You know what I mean.
I'm going to have
a talk with your friends.

23
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,843
No!
They need to stop.

24
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,428
No, I don't want you
freaking them out.

25
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,976
Fine. Fine, we'll go to the
hospital, but they're going
to tell you that I'm fine,

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,354
and they're going to tell you
that you don't need to
worry about...

27
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,814
(TRUCK HORN BLARING)
Mom!

28
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,933
Mom?

29
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,644
Mom?

30
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,608
Hello?

31
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:03,540
Mom, you gotta wake up.
No one's coming. Mom!

32
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,425
<i>WOMAN.: 911,
what's your emergency?</i>

33
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:17,012
We got into an accident
along the Canal Road
just outside Kingston.

34
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,473
My mom's unconscious.

35
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

36
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm fine.

37
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,359
Mom? Mom?

38
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,233
Where's Foreman?

39
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,776
He's down here somewhere.

40
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,112
"Somewhere." Very helpful.

41
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,990
Do you have any idea
when he's getting out tonight?

42
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,283
Sometime.

43
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,617
I realize you can't predict.

44
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,121
I just thought you might be
able to estimate.
It's Valentines Day.

45
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,747
I've planned
a surprise getaway.

46
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,999
Get away.

47
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,752
Get away.

48
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,380
Get away.

49
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,469
Is my mom okay?

50
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,096
She's gone to surgery.

51
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,687
Foreman, your girlfriend
wants to know if you're
available for Valentine's.

52
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,940
Act surprised.
What are you doing down here?

53
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,027
There's a snowstorm.
ER's short-staffed.
We're all supposed to be here.

54
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,113
You're supposed to be here.
You're an ass. Act surprised.

55
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,867
This could sting a little.

56
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,663
Can we hurry this up?
Make sure that...

57
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,083
Take your time.
What's your name?

58
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,212
Hannah Morganthal.

59
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,340
You have CIPA,
Hannah Morganthal.

60
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,591
No, I don't.

61
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,677
We have to do x-rays to
make sure you don't have
internal injuries,

62
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,346
blood tests to make sure
no infections.

63
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:27,643
EEG for neurological anomalies
and biopsy a spinal nerve.

64
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:32,272
Congenital insensitivity
to pain is one of the rarest
conditions on the planet.

65
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,608
There's only been
about 60 documented cases.

66
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,695
Yeah, and I have seven reasons
to think that
she's one of them.

67
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,947
She says she's not.

68
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,782
And that's reason number one.

69
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,117
She knew what it was
without us telling her.

70
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,455
Two, she's still wet from
the snow. She's not shivering.
That's odd,

71
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,083
unless she can't sweat
or feel hot and cold.

72
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,001
The ambulance was warm.

73
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,545
I want to see my mother.

74
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,588
Three, scarring around
the lips and tongue.

75
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,049
When she was a baby,
she chewed on herself
without feeling it.

76
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,759
I fell through a window
when I was a kid.

77
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,553
Four, when you cleaned
the wound,

78
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,180
she flexed into the cleaner
instead of away from it.

79
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,016
It's hard to fake pain
when you've never felt it.

80
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,272
It takes an imaginative leap,
Ms. Morganthal.
That's one of them Jew names.

81
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,358
Ashkenazis are a
higher-risk group.

82
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,527
On the other hand,
she says she doesn't have it,

83
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,071
and she'd be dead by now
if she'd never been diagnosed.

84
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,533
They killed our Lord.
You're gonna trust them?

85
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,245
She wants to see her mom.
She admits having CIPA,

86
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,039
she knows we're not
letting her go anywhere
without a battery of tests.

87
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,457
You said you had
seven reasons.

88
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,293
I pulled a number
out of the air.

89
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,544
What, five isn't enough?

90
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,421
Five lame reasons aren't.

91
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,464
I'm taking her to
see her mom as soon as...

92
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,428
I can hit her again
if six isn't enough.

93
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,098
Do the tests.

94
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,478
Need to bail on the ER.
I got a case.

95
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:57,941
Why are you wearing perfume?

96
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,067
Is this a real case

97
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,904
or one of those imaginary
cases that happen
when you're bored?

98
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,447
CIPA.

99
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,866
CIPA is a diagnosis.

100
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,119
Diagnoses happen
at the end of cases.

101
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,288
She's got no idea
what's going on in her body.

102
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,748
There's bound to be
something wrong.

103
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,500
In other words,
she could be
perfectly healthy,

104
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,211
but you're curious
about someone who
can't feel pain

105
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,839
because you always feel pain,
so you want to go exploring.

106
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,633
She was in a car accident.

107
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,011
She needs x-rays,
blood tests, EEG,
nerve biopsy.

108
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,306
I also note that,
although snow is coming down
in sheets this morning,

109
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,309
you left your hat at home,
and you used earmuffs.

110
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,810
Do your tests,
except for the...

111
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,896
So while everyone else
was just worrying
about getting in,

112
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,232
you were concerned
with hat head.

113
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,528
Blind dates are
never a good idea.

114
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:47,574
Only reason to wear a scarf
like that is as a beacon
to identify you in a crowd.

115
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,826
Do your tests,
except for the nerve biopsy.

116
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,912
I need the nerve biopsy.
You'd risk paralyzing her.

117
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,080
It's neurological.

118
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,998
You have no evidence of that.

119
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,708
She tripped.

120
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,503
Do you have any evidence,
other than the fact

121
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,840
that a typically clumsy
CIPA patient tripped
on an icy day?

122
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,220
If the EEG reveals a problem,
we can talk then.

123
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,184
Could have left the scarf
at home and just told him

124
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,228
you'd be wearing
a look of desperation.

125
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,067
Spiking on leads C-3 and O-2.

126
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,360
She could be going into
a seizure.

127
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,612
HANNAH: Hello?
I think there's
a simpler explanation.

128
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:30,325
You're not gonna
find anything. I'm fine!
I want to see my mom!

129
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,327
So sedate her.

130
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,620
She won't consent.

131
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,038
She's a teenager.

132
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,957
No dad.
Mom's still in surgery.

133
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,001
What do you want us to do?
Hold her down?

134
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,837
Well, only until you
inject her with a sedative.
Then you can let her go.

135
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,046
We tried.

136
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,256
Seriously?

137
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,967
She's strong and doesn't care.
We'd have broken something

138
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,052
before we can get her
to sit still enough
to inject her.

139
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,097
So break her arm.
She won't mind.

140
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,349
You're cranky.
I'm in pain.

141
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,936
Come on,
let's go break her arm.

142
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,234
Nurse Shortie, your biznitch,
how long are you going to
waste her time?

143
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,944
I'm so glad
we're walking somewhere.

144
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,738
Another 60 feet,
and this conversation is over.

145
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,324
When you guys are
out of this program,
Cameron will find somebody,

146
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,744
Chase will find
eight somebodies,
and you'll be alone.

147
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,954
Thirty feet.
You'll date, and you'll date,

148
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,540
but you're the ultimate
Darwinian. You have to
fight for everything.

149
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,501
Anybody else
would just slow you down.
Yeah.

150
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,668
I'm still with her, aren't I?

151
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:22,794
Yeah.

152
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,589
I can only imagine it's
because she hasn't given you
an excuse to break up,

153
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,926
and you don't have the guts
to recognize your own reality.

154
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,054
I want to see my mother.

155
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,263
Hi again.

156
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,225
I'm sure I could say this
without being condescending,

157
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,310
but then you'd get
the false impression
that I respect you,

158
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,648
so you're a kid,
you're scared,
you're stalling, grow up.

159
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,609
I'm not scared.
I'm never scared.

160
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,028
See? How juvenile was that?

161
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,031
You can't feel pain.
Nothing left but pleasure.

162
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,866
Why don't you tell me
how wonderful that is?

163
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,992
It sucks.

164
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,494
Better than being
in pain all the time.

165
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,204
Get in the chair.

166
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,081
Every morning,
I have to check my eyes

167
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,041
to make sure
I didn't scratch a cornea
in my sleep.

168
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,378
Oh, God, stop.
I'm in a pool of tears here.

169
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,379
I can't cry.

170
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,713
Neither can I.

171
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,218
Every morning,
I check my eyes for jaundice

172
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,762
in case the Vicodin's
finally shot my liver.

173
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,014
I can't run anywhere
without examining all my toes

174
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,016
for swelling.
I can't run.

175
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,561
Boys can't hold me
for too long
because I can overheat.

176
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:23,647
Girls can't hold me
for too long because
I only pay for an hour.

177
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,359
I need an alarm on my watch
to remind me to
go to the bathroom.

178
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,862
Know how many humiliating
experiences before
I thought of that?

179
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,614
Bathroom is 50 feet
from my office.
Every drink of water,

180
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,032
I weigh the pros and cons.

181
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,118
After everything I do,
I self-check.

182
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,413
Mouth, tongue,
gums for cuts, count teeth,
check temperature,

183
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,332
fingers, toes and joints
for swelling,
skin for bruises.

184
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,042
I got shot.

185
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:52,134
I sat on a stove
when I was three.
Want to see the coil marks?

186
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,594
Yeah.
You think I'm lying?

187
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,470
<i>You think I would just want to
check out your tuchus,</i>

188
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,389
as your people would say?

189
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:10,444
Put her in the chair
and run the damn test. If she
moves again, give her nitrous.

190
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,946
You weren't shot because
of leg pain. You were shot
because you're a jerk.

191
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,324
Some think
the two are connected.

192
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,660
<i>(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)</i>

193
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,333
He didn't have to do that.

194
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,959
Yeah, he did.

195
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,252
I'm sick?

196
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,338
No, your EEG was normal.

197
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,964
X-ray showed no break.

198
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,050
Blood tests showed
no infections.
Urine indicated no...

199
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,427
Hannah?

200
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,556
Call a code! Oh, God.

201
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,643
Need ice packs
and cooling blankets.

202
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,229
Got saline in there?
She's not flushed.

203
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,688
She's not sweating.
You must be...

204
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,690
She has a temperature of 105.

205
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,625
Wow, she's actually sick.

206
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,086
We got her temperature
down below boiling.
It could be infection.

207
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,464
No, LP showed normal proteins
and no white blood cells.

208
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,633
High bilirubin.
Could be a liver problem.

209
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,427
Nope, transaminases
were normal.
Could be drugs.

210
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,887
She's smoked pot
since she was 11.

211
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,556
No again.
Tox screen was clean.

212
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,849
We're doing
this case backwards.

213
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,392
We do the tests,
and then she gets sick?

214
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,353
Maybe we did something to her.
Maybe she got
sick after the tests.

215
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,188
We should rerun them.

216
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,191
And biopsy a spinal nerve.

217
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,071
You want to risk paralysis
because she's got a fever?

218
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,449
I want to risk paralysis
because I don't know
what's causing the fever.

219
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,993
If it's neurological...
It's a fever.

220
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:45,497
In a CIPA patient. Obviously
things are a little different
in her upstairs wiring.

221
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,207
And have been since
the day she was born.

222
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,667
Yeah, it's much more likely

223
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,295
that whatever it is
was cleverly waiting
and hiding

224
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,713
until you guys
were done testing.

225
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,797
Where are you going?

226
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,300
You're all against this,
right?

227
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:00,179
And you're all gonna stand
on principle and refuse
to do it, right?

228
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,891
I'm going to get
Cuddy's approval.

229
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,605
CAMERON: How long are we going
to keep Hannah in the dark
about her mother?

230
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,690
CHASE: Long as possible.

231
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,609
Side airbags
should be standard.

232
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,485
I'm sure she'll agree.

233
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,698
She should know
her mother's situation.

234
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,327
Breaking that news
is that surgeon's problem.

235
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,454
Any word from House?

236
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,580
No.

237
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,583
Well, maybe Cuddy will say no.

238
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,168
Cuddy never says no.

239
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,377
That's not true.

240
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,297
Nobody ever says no.
We don't say no.

241
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,632
You don't say no.

242
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,509
He'll come back.
He'll browbeat us.

243
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,721
He'll give us seven reasons,
and eventually we'll fold.
We all will, not just me.

244
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,600
The only way
we can avoid biopsying
this kid's spine

245
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,018
is to find the answer
some other way.

246
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,145
All the tests were negative.

247
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,563
We need a better history.

248
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,065
How much more paperwork
do you need?

249
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,734
We've got pediatric records,
a few dozen ER records,

250
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,070
our own admission
questionnaire.

251
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,696
What's the first question?

252
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,406
Insurance coverage.

253
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,699
Okay, second question.

254
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,368
Just make your point.

255
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,496
"Where does it hurt?"

256
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,623
If we knew where it hurt,
we could diagnose her.

257
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,792
You do know CIPA means
she can't feel pain.

258
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,586
No, CIPA means she's
insensitive to pain.

259
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,005
She still has
scattered nerve fibers
that could conduct pain,

260
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,383
but the signals don't make
it to the brain.

261
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,762
What if we give her more
pain signals,
a lot more pain signals?

262
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,514
Maybe some of them
will make it through.

263
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,807
You want to torture her?

264
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,642
No.

265
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,520
Yes, we do this
to anybody else, it's torture.

266
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,398
Doing it to her
is no different
than pricking a finger.

267
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,275
We keep poking sharp sticks
into her,

268
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,777
eventually we'll find the part
that's already tender.

269
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,243
So what does
a Dean of Medicine do?

270
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,620
Oh, can we please
not talk about that?

271
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,623
I will talk about
anything else. I'm just trying
to get away from work.

272
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:55,794
Metaphorically,
because geographically,
the coffee place

273
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,839
around the corner from
the hospital probably isn't
the furthest you could get.

274
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,299
Well, the snow!

275
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,342
The roads are clearing,

276
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,387
but it's a good place
to beat a retreat from.

277
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,266
You usually expect
your dates to go wrong?

278
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,393
Experience has taught me
to have an escape route.

279
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,937
Well, low expectations,
that's in my favor.

280
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,573
Whatever happens,
I need you to understand

281
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:28,285
that there are
certain aspects to my life
I'm not happy about.

282
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,996
Need a nerve biopsy.

283
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,041
And you had to come here
personally to tell me that?

284
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,584
And how did you even know
I was here?

285
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,586
I had to bring the file,

286
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,465
and this was the most
noncommittal location
in walking distance.

287
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,885
You left your car keys
in your desk. Greg House.

288
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,888
You two must have met online.

289
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,058
Either that,
or you've got a friend
who secretly hates you.

290
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,560
Don Herrick.

291
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,232
Yeah, we connected through
SingleBallroomDanceLovers. Com.

292
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,071
Why would he volunteer
that information?

293
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,322
Why would I hide it?

294
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,825
You didn't tell him that
anything he said would be
held against you?

295
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,786
So what line of work
are you in?

296
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:13,956
Auto maintenance,
changing oil and filters.

297
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,751
Great, 'cause my place
overcharges. Can't trust
anything you guys say.

298
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:18,794
Where are you located?

299
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,797
In 14 states.
I own Eastern Lube.

300
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:30,013
Most CIPA complications
are infection,
and she's got a fever.

301
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,099
LP? Urine?

302
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,642
Clean. Normal.

303
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,561
Same with
the white-blood-cell count.

304
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,479
Cancer?
Nothing on the scan.

305
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,731
I think it's her nerves
messing with
the temperature control.

306
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,442
Amyloid, sarcoid,
there's a lot of candidates.

307
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:43,944
I want a biopsy.

308
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,697
Fine, if that's what
you need, go get it.

309
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:54,830
(LOUDLY) He seems a lot nicer
than that one from
WiccaNeedsADaddyFigure. Com.

310
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,674
CHASE: One of these is warm,

311
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,594
and the other is very hot.

312
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:13,974
Start here.
Move to the hot one.
Just a few seconds, then back.

313
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,311
We're gonna monitor activity
in your brain while you do it.

314
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:21,773
If you feel any response
to the heat, it could
indicate a vascular problem.

315
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,072
How's my mom doing?

316
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,783
<i>She's okay.
Do you feel anything?</i>

317
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,744
No.

318
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,455
What does "okay" mean?

319
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:37,664
<i>She's still in surgery.</i>

320
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,166
They tell me it's going okay.

321
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,792
<i>Can you take your hand out?</i>

322
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,128
And you didn't
ask anything else?

323
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,172
Take your hand
out of the water.

324
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,132
What's going on
with my mother?

325
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,261
Hannah!

326
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,973
You just got
second-degree burns.

327
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,686
I'll be fine. What's going on
with my mother?
Is she gonna die?

328
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,064
They said she's okay.
Surgery this long

329
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,483
is typical when there are
internal injuries.

330
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,779
FOREMAN: Naloxone and
kinase proteins in.

331
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,864
And that's gonna make
me feel pain?

332
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,283
I didn't feel anything when
you guys screwed this thing
into my head.

333
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,745
It'll replace missing
chemicals in your nerves,
heighten sensitivity.

334
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,997
We're gonna be drilling
directly into your skull.

335
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,583
A response should
indicate sarcoma.

336
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,252
What does it feel like?

337
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,254
It hurts.

338
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,340
I'm sorry.

339
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,053
Bone pain is the worst
there is, so you need

340
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,472
to let me know as soon
as you feel anything.

341
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,890
She's ready.

342
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,603
So, what, I just sit here
while you guys
drill a hole in me?

343
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,606
You wanna talk?

344
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,361
Just you and your mom, huh?
You two must be pretty close.

345
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,615
We were, until I got arrested.
Third time.

346
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,784
Drugs?
Fights.

347
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,452
You got an advantage.

348
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,038
Not really.
Never know when to stop.

349
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,959
You piss a lot of people off,
or are you just trying to
piss off your mom?

350
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,212
Those are pretty much
the only two choices you have.

351
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:15,804
Hannah? You want us to stop?
Stop the drill!
Stop the drill!

352
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,973
(SCREAMING)

353
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,690
It's okay. What did you feel?

354
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:31,320
Where did you feel it?
Hannah, I need to know
how it hurt.

355
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,952
Hannah!

356
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,002
I am so tired of this.
Did you know

357
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,796
that the new nurse from
Cardiology is sleeping
with that weird lawyer

358
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,839
from the board?

359
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,591
The guy with 11 fingers?

360
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,593
He has 11 fingers?

361
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,553
How do you not notice that?

362
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,723
The nurse used to be a man.

363
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,935
She's not anymore?
But we can't talk about that.

364
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,811
I thought we were.
We were supposed
to talk about that.

365
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:08,190
I came here to talk
about that, but on the way up,
I ran into Cameron.

366
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,651
You've got a CIPA patient?

367
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,361
Tranny nurse
is more interesting.

368
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,739
Oh, it's way more interesting,
but instead I've got to be
your damn conscience.

369
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,158
I'm tired of being your
conscience. I don't enjoy
being your conscience.

370
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,035
No one enjoys...
You're studying her.

371
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,161
She's actually sick.

372
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,330
Which you found out
after you took her on.

373
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,375
I was curious.
Since I'm not a cat,
that's not dangerous.

374
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,670
I don't think that metaphor
was designed to actually
warn cats.

375
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,797
You don't care
about her illness.
You care about CIPA,

376
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,008
which means your focus is
gonna be on getting
your answers, not hers.

377
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,553
Thank you.
Forewarned is forearmed.

378
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,346
What do you think
you're gonna figure out?

379
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:43,058
Do you think her lack of pain
is somehow the answer
to your pain?

380
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,644
I think if you'd stop
talking to Cameron,

381
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:49,690
then right now we could be
ranking nurses
in order of do-ability.

382
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,483
I need you.
What did
the nerve biopsy show?

383
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,818
Never did it.
Well, then do it.

384
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,152
Can't.
Why?

385
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,613
She's gonna jump off
the lobby balcony.

386
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,407
You think I can catch her?

387
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,413
Get away from me!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

388
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,957
Yes, you are.
You're just jealous
I can do anything.

389
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,834
Hannah, you're having
a paranoid delusion.

390
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,002
I don't believe you.

391
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,336
Did you think she would?

392
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,590
This is real.
You want me to be in pain.
You even said so.

393
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,176
If we wanted to hurt you,
we'd let you jump.

394
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,927
Just let me see my mother.

395
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,597
Fine, we'll take you
to our OR observation room.

396
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,557
I don't believe you!
Your mother is fine.

397
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,601
I just spoke to her surgeon.
I don't believe you!

398
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:29,271
Hannah, what do you
want from us?
What do you want us to do?

399
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,648
I can't feel my legs.

400
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,775
You're trying to pull
the same stunt
twice in 10 minutes.

401
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:38,322
I'm not pretending.
They don't hurt.
They're just... They're...

402
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,381
Anything?
We're not looking for pain.

403
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:57,674
Anything at all? Pressure?

404
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,800
Nothing.

405
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:02,429
You have six broken bones,
a fever, a concussion,
erratic heart rhythms

406
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:05,015
and a complete lack
of sensation below the waist.

407
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,017
I feel fine.

408
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,562
Is my mother
out of surgery yet?

409
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,939
Not yet.

410
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,234
This is excellent.

411
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,027
The paranoia seems
to have dissipated,

412
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,446
but her vitals keep
getting worse.
She could be dead in hours.

413
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:24,701
But if you're gonna die
a miserable, lingering death,
pain-free is the way to do it.

414
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,620
Are we sure the fall
didn't cause the paralysis?

415
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:30,999
The paralysis caused the fall.
Spine's clean.
No vertebral fractures

416
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,459
or spinal cord compression.

417
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,961
Even better.

418
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,881
The nuttiness and paralysis
mean there's definitely
a neurological component.

419
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,216
Could be a nerve disease.

420
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,010
Which is why we need to look
at the nerve that
you didn't biopsy.

421
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,220
There are other tests.

422
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,097
HIV? Syphilis?

423
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:49,852
She was negative for all STDs.
Vascular?
No, ANA was negative.

424
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,854
Cerebral clot? No, MRI was...

425
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,522
Thyroid storm.

426
00:21:55,983 --> 00:22:00,028
Makes sense given her
glucose reaction was slow,
and potassium's down.

427
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:05,242
Yeah, I'll check with
an endocrinologist.

428
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,493
Bennett's on call.

429
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:07,703
Perfect.

430
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,330
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

431
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,759
No.
Need a consult.

432
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,845
I already okayed
your nerve biopsy.

433
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,305
Need an endocrinologist.

434
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,347
Bennett's on call.

435
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,515
Won't pick up.

436
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,850
His cell phone must be broken.

437
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,310
Mine's working.

438
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,895
Had to give you the file.

439
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:39,735
I assume you're thinking
thyroid storm. Have you
done a hormone panel?

440
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,196
Normal.
TSH was on the low side.

441
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:46,408
Is that a cheery fire
I hear crackling nearby?

442
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:49,119
No, what about CPK enzymes?

443
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,787
Elevated, 275.

444
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:56,210
People light fires
for themselves,
but then they don't deny it.

445
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:58,712
He's here?

446
00:22:58,795 --> 00:22:59,963
CPK isn't high enough.

447
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:03,300
Potassium's what
you'd expect because of
the bronchodilators.

448
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,303
Oh, my God!
You're not wearing a bra.

449
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,721
It's not thyroid storm.

450
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:08,805
You just met him.

451
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,015
I like him,

452
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,519
and I like sex.
Do I need to stitch
a letter on my tops?

453
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:17,147
No. Might be worth
taking out an ad
in the local papers.

454
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,445
Do you like me, House?

455
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:28,575
I was on the phone
with Bennett 15 minutes ago.
His cell phone's working.

456
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,578
Your MO is to avoid me
at all costs,

457
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:35,541
and suddenly you need my input
on every move you make.
I can only assume

458
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:36,917
it's because I'm on a date.

459
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,126
When we met, I noticed...

460
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,546
You noticed he was a Shriner
because of the way
he parted his hair.

461
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:43,090
You noticed he was a mama's
boy because of the way
he blinked his left eye.

462
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,551
I'm not interested.
I'm not impressed.

463
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,512
There are only two reasons
anyone would want to
screw with me tonight.

464
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,264
Either they're an
altruistic decent person

465
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:55,102
who's worried about
my well-being, or they
want me for themselves.

466
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,523
You left out the third option.

467
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,985
Evil bastard who just wants
to mess with
other people's happiness.

468
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,658
Good night, House.

469
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,920
We won't be bothered again.

470
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:26,758
It's late. I should go.

471
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:27,926
Why?

472
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,556
I part my hair on the left,
and I'm a Shriner?

473
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,266
You heard the conversation?

474
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,393
I'm not interested in him.

475
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,603
I don't blame you.

476
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,772
I only said those things
so that he wouldn't come back.

477
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,487
I don't really care
about my job. I do it well.

478
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,741
I provide a service,
but my goal was always
to make enough money

479
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:55,245
to do the things
I really like.
Music, travel...

480
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,331
I like those things, too.

481
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,751
You like them,
but they're not
really important to you.

482
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:06,048
I don't know whether
it's House, your job, or
you just thrive on conflict,

483
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:09,760
but you should hear yourself
when you're talking to him.

484
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:17,559
Nothing else in the world's
going on. You're focused,
confident, compelling.

485
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:26,193
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'd like to go out
with that woman.

486
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,697
I can get her on the phone.

487
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,962
Where did you go?
She's getting worse.

488
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,798
It's not thyroid storm.
Give me a spinal nerve.

489
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,341
There are still other tests.

490
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,759
She just said
the girl is getting worse.

491
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,719
You really want to wait?

492
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,020
CAMERON: We'll be risking
infection, maybe make
the paralysis worse.

493
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:05,315
It is worse, and we're
making it worse than worse?
Do the biopsy.

494
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,734
We could paralyze her
and get no useful information.

495
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:09,152
Do the biopsy.

496
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,487
If you're thinking
peripheral neuropathy,

497
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,239
we should take a nerve
a little further away
from the spine.

498
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,825
A little further
from the truth.
We're talking paralysis.

499
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,869
There's a good chance
the spine is relevant.

500
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,997
If this thing is progressing,
it could kill her in hours.

501
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,167
Give me back my papers.

502
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,793
Is he asking
for a spinal nerve?

503
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,296
How did you know?

504
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:28,547
Give us a minute.

505
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:38,473
Did you know they recently
found a protein that
speeds up nerve growth?

506
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:41,185
Fascinating stuff.
If you put that protein

507
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,853
with the insulation
from a spinal nerve,

508
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,647
you could grow your
own little garden.
If that spinal nerve...

509
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:48,859
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
if it happened to come
from a person with CIPA,

510
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:52,946
I can grow pain-free nerves
and graft them into my own
leg. What an evil plan!

511
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,240
You'd have to be
on immunosuppressors for life.

512
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,242
Risk of infection,
shorter lifespan...

513
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,119
Shorter but normal.

514
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:04,374
Usually jealousy expresses
itself by trying to destroy
what someone has.

515
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:08,045
You're more ambitious.
You actually want to
change medical fact

516
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,171
to get this thing...

517
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:10,756
Medical fact
changes all the time.

518
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,132
You're risking
your patient's life.

519
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,926
That's how medical fact
changes.

520
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:14,968
A doctor risks...

521
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,221
To serve their
patient's health,

522
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,263
not their own.

523
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:19,556
This is medically justified.

524
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:24,937
Are you sure? Are you sure
that you're the right one
to be making this call?

525
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:39,409
Biopsy whatever nerve
you figure you could
safely get at.

526
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,912
God, Wilson's annoying.

527
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,376
Past 3:00 a.m.
On Valentine's Day night.

528
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,878
I assume you had
a date with Wendy.

529
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,839
She'll survive.
She knows the deal.

530
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:53,924
You're lucky.
I know.

531
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:58,262
Someday, when there's time,
I would like to actually
have a social life.

532
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,597
Someday? Come on.

533
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,392
If there's one thing
a good-looking woman
can have whenever she wants,

534
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:04,434
it's a social life.

535
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,061
You mean a sex life.

536
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,188
There's nothing wrong
with a little companionship

537
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,481
until the real thing
comes along.

538
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:10,732
I had the real thing.

539
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:13,151
Forgive me
if I don't want to settle.

540
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,696
Right.
What does that mean?

541
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,239
Nothing.

542
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,241
You think I didn't have
the real thing?

543
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:21,577
I have no idea what you had.

544
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,412
And yet you're judging it.

545
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,749
It's late. I'm cranky. Sorry.

546
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,334
I didn't have the real thing.

547
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:30,544
How could you even know?

548
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,504
You married a dying man.

549
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:36,550
You thought,
"Six months, a year,
it'll be tough,

550
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,011
"but then I'll recover,
and I'll have
the rest of my life."

551
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,890
It's like willingly getting
the flu or joining
the Peace Corps, short-term.

552
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:47,227
Wow, you nailed it.
It's basically like
a wasted weekend.

553
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:52,191
The sacrifices you made were
huge, but they were at the
height of your love for him.

554
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:56,528
Commitment is only commitment
because it has no
expiration date.

555
00:28:56,612 --> 00:29:01,116
You stand next to someone
and watch them floss for
30 years like my parents have,

556
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,453
then ask for sacrifices.
That's how you know
the real thing.

557
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:17,007
Cameron, I wasn't
criticizing you.

558
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:22,846
People who avoid commitment
are people who know
what a big thing it is.

559
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,105
This isn't right.

560
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,570
CIPA can't cause
this much degeneration.

561
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:41,698
A few nerve fibers we
teased out of the center
have some insulation left,

562
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,326
but the insulation
around the bundles
has been stripped bare.

563
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:46,286
Means the damage
must be coming
from the outside in.

564
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,165
Which means it's secondary
demyelination, which means
the source is somewhere else,

565
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,834
which tells us it's not
a nerve disease.

566
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,962
It's something systemic
that's affecting the nerves,

567
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,714
which means that we need to...

568
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:59,466
Where are you going?

569
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,343
Kid's mom is
finally out of surgery.

570
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,763
I'll be right back.

571
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,226
So what?

572
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,644
Hannah should see her.

573
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:14,648
Yes, immediately after
we're done chatting
about saving her life.

574
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,067
Most likely causes
are metabolic.

575
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,945
They found brain swelling.
They're prepping her mother
for another surgery.

576
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:23,740
Again, so what?
Get a nurse to take the kid.

577
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,326
There are more
than 60 different
metabolic conditions

578
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,662
that could account for what
she's got. There's only
three of you guys.

579
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:31,165
She's scared.
She should be.

580
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:32,875
She'll die if
we don't diagnose her.

581
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,585
So diagnose her.

582
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,471
Mom?

583
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:08,702
How bad is it? Are you okay?

584
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:11,622
I'm okay, Mom.

585
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:14,750
I'll get better.
I always get better.

586
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:18,420
Are you checking yourself,
your temperature?

587
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:24,760
Mom, could you just let it go?
You shouldn't be worrying.

588
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,263
Baby, I'm sorry.

589
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:31,225
I should have seen
that car coming.

590
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:35,562
No, Mom, I did this
to myself. I screwed up.

591
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,359
You were right.
You were right,
and I was wrong.

592
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,070
No. No.

593
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:48,033
I shouldn't have gone out
on the ice. I shouldn't
have fallen down,

594
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:53,455
and I shouldn't have made you
rush me to an ER
for the 10th time this year.

595
00:31:58,252 --> 00:31:59,378
(MONITOR BEEPING)

596
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,796
Mom?

597
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,552
Mom?
You okay?

598
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,012
They have to take her
back to surgery.

599
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:12,641
Hannah, your BP is way up.
We need to get you some rest.

600
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,436
My hand's wet.

601
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,106
You're crying.

602
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,649
I can't cry.

603
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,158
My head's killing me.

604
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:40,294
So what does the pain tell us?

605
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,254
No tingling or itching,
so we can rule out...

606
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:45,132
It tells us nothing.
It wasn't physical pain.
It was emotional.

607
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:48,302
Exactly. What were they doing
when she got the headache?

608
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:49,428
Saying goodbye.

609
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,888
You said they were arguing.

610
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,931
They weren't really arguing.
She was just frustrated.

611
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:54,433
What were they arguing about?

612
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:55,976
Whose fault it was.

613
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:01,857
Peripheral neuropathy,
fever and intermittent
paranoia.

614
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,320
Lots of metabolic conditions
can explain those things.
What if we add guilt?

615
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,740
Guilt? As a symptom?

616
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:13,035
Alzheimer's can
cause euphoria,
pain causes depression,

617
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:17,247
and B12 deficiency
causes guilt, along with
all that other stuff.

618
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:20,167
If she felt guilty, she
wouldn't be making her
mother's life miserable.

619
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,002
She wouldn't be getting
in fights, getting arrested.

620
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:24,171
Maybe she's fighting
because she feels guilty.

621
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:26,632
She's showing her mom
she can take stupid risks
and still be safe.

622
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:27,716
Means mom can let go.

623
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,009
CHASE: Which is rational.

624
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:31,011
If guilt is a symptom,
it's caused by the illness,

625
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,263
not by a thought process,
and it would have to be new.

626
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:34,765
Couple years ago,
she was a model student.

627
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,683
This is pointless.
If the headache
was caused by guilt,

628
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,101
she has a B12 deficiency.

629
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:40,062
If it's just because
she was sad,
it's meaningless.

630
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:41,396
How the hell do we
test for that?

631
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:42,523
We don't.

632
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:46,443
Give her a shot of B12.
When she gets better,
I was right.

633
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:50,447
We already did.
ER gave her B12 when
she was admitted,

634
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:55,202
part of a multivitamin
supplement.
Apparently, she's just sad.

635
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,334
Why are you still here?

636
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:05,796
Trying to get a couple pages
into a drug trial.
Paperwork's due tomorrow.

637
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:06,922
Why are you here?

638
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,882
Still haven't figured out why.

639
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:11,218
No, I meant here,
in my office.

640
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:15,722
Just dumped a cool B12 theory.
Moved on to leukemia.

641
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:18,433
Very pedestrian.

642
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,935
I'm not happy.

643
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:23,021
Her white-blood-cell
count was low.

644
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:26,692
The ones she's got,
it's just a lot of
eosinophils.

645
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,944
The immunoglobulin
E-level's borderline.

646
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,405
If you want to be 100% sure,
check the bone marrow.

647
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:33,866
The team's doing
a biopsy right now.

648
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:39,621
It turns out the
weird lawyer knew

649
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:41,165
that she used to be a man.

650
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:42,332
And he's cool with that?

651
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,878
Turns out that his
previous girlfriend
also used to be a man.

652
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,464
Yeah.

653
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:57,181
Is it possible for you
to just watch me eat,

654
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:03,103
or do you get some primeval
thrill out of beating
the other hunters to the food?

655
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:12,988
See you later.

656
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:16,533
You still haven't figured out
that I don't need sedation?

657
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,411
It's so you don't move
during the procedure.

658
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:23,248
Is that nitrous?
What, are you
trying to kill her?

659
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,126
We gave her nitrous
during the EEG.

660
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,544
That's what made this thing
rear its ugly...

661
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:28,712
What thing?

662
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:29,963
B12 deficiency.

663
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,089
Are you having déja vu?

664
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:34,134
We've had this conversation.
She was given B12.
She didn't get better.

665
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:37,596
Because someone else ate it.
Get an abdominal MRI.

666
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,808
What? What are you doing?
Don't touch me!

667
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:43,644
Don't touch me!
See? There's she goes.

668
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:45,771
Don't touch me!
Another paranoid delusion.

669
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:50,317
At the rate she's going
downhill, forget the MRI.
We need an OR.

670
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,401
Leave me alone!

671
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:53,987
Occupied!

672
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,197
Her hernia can wait.

673
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,907
Help! They're trying
to kill me!

674
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,160
Okay, you can either believe
that we really are
trying to kill her,

675
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:02,788
or you can assume
she's suffering from
a medical condition.

676
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:05,332
Seeing as this is a hospital,
and we're all dressed
like doctors,

677
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,209
and there are easier ways
to kill somebody...

678
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:09,461
Bev, help them.
I'm gonna need iodine,

679
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:13,340
scalpel numbers 10 and 15,
forceps and a largish
salad bowl.

680
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,510
Okay, hold her down.

681
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:20,138
Come on, weenie,
she's in a cast.

682
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,224
Swab.

683
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:26,979
Fifteen.

684
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,564
You're not gonna
anesthetize her?

685
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,816
Relax.
It's just a magic trick.

686
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,861
(SCREAMING)

687
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:38,198
She's faking it.
We're not falling
for it this time.

688
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,994
Okay, keep that retracted.

689
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,625
Forceps.

690
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:06,685
Lake fishing can be fun.
It can bring the generations
together.

691
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:10,230
But if you don't cook
that trout or perch well,

692
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:13,192
you'll be giving
room and board to this fellow,

693
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:17,362
and by "free board,"
I mean all the B12
you can take in.

694
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,072
I could have a tapeworm in me?

695
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,575
Not likely.
You'd be in a lot of pain.

696
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,375
It's gotta be 25 feet long.

697
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:33,295
Damn it.
World record's over 60.

698
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:46,141
Hannah, wake up.
Somebody here to see you.

699
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,938
She's got limited motion
on her left side.

700
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:54,149
You might have
to take care of her
for a while.

701
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:01,156
You don't feel it,
but you're about to rip
your stitches out.

702
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:04,409
Take care of yourself.
Then you can take care of her.

703
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,421
You haven't gone home.

704
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,674
Sorry I screwed up
Valentine's day.

705
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:23,929
I'm dating a doctor.
I'd be an idiot
to expect anything else.

706
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,933
I did get you a gift. MGH.

707
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:31,520
Best teaching hospital
in Boston.

708
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:35,315
You want to be
a nurse practitioner?
That's as good as it gets.

709
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:39,319
I made a few calls,
and you're in if you want in.

710
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:43,407
This is why you've been
helping me get my surgical
hours for accreditation.

711
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:45,659
I thought you wanted...
Stupid.

712
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:51,915
You've got 10 feet of
personal space around you.

713
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:54,293
I step forward, you step back.

714
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,044
I've shared
a lot of things with you.

715
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,172
Which is why
you're breaking up with me.

716
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,092
You can't stand to be close.

717
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:05,679
Wendy, you think
I'll stay with you
because you're angry with me?

718
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,389
I'm upset

719
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,726
because I care.

720
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,980
Only you'd expect
an argument to be rational,

721
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:18,358
you and that
ass boss of yours.

722
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:44,218
Well, you could ask her
for the spinal nerve.

723
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,720
She's got no reason
to give it.

724
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:47,930
She owes you.

725
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:51,391
The hospital will
send her a bill.

726
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:56,188
I'm just saying, if you want
to do it, do it while
her B12 is still low.

727
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:59,233
Guilt can be your friend.

728
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:06,031
Breakfast?

729
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,492
Yeah.

730
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,540
Happy Valentine's Day.

731
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:17,125
Holiday that only applies
to people who are
already paired up.

732
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,127
For everyone else,
it's Wednesday.

733
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:22,381
Wow, thank you for
that dash of cold water.

734
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,633
Don't get me wrong.
I still think true love's
out there.

735
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:27,970
It's just very far away,
possibly in another galaxy.

736
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,097
We may need to develop
faster-than-light travel

737
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,182
before we can make contact.

738
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,603
So I'm thinking
we should have sex.

739
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:40,232
That makes sense.

740
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:41,567
Despite the wisdom
of pop songs,

741
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,486
there's no point putting
our lives on hold
until love comes along.

742
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:49,158
We're both healthy and
busy people. We work together
so it's convenient.

743
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,701
Like microwave pizza.

744
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:51,910
And of all the people
I work with,

745
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,663
you're the one
I'm least likely
to fall in love with.

746
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:56,832
Like microwave pizza.

747
00:40:56,915 --> 00:41:00,586
The point here is to
make things simpler,
not more complicated.

748
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:03,130
Someday, there'll be time
to get serious about someone.

749
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:06,633
Meanwhile, we already had
sex once and didn't
get weird about it, so...

750
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:11,805
I get it. I get it.
So what if I'm offended
by your judgment?

751
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:16,059
Then you're not the man
I'm looking for.
