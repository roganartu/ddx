No. I did, Sarge. Right when

Ex-Marine thinks
he has Gulf War syndrome.

There's no such thing.
So he's been told.

It hasn't stopped
the unexplained fatigue,
rashes and joint pain.

he's the nephew of a
benefactor I owe a favor,

whether you like it or not.

to take the case?

Okay. Well, you're about to.
He's on his way here.

Get your ass up
and get your team together.

That's amazing.
No, it's not.

make a penny come out of
a child's ear, or any other

42

do is dream about someone
I've never seen before.

Well, just because you don't
understand it doesn't mean
it can't happen.

47
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,361
True. It can't happen
because it can't happen!

48
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,701
Well, maybe you didn't dream
about this guy specifically.

49
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,623
Right. Just some other guy
who looks exactly like him.

50
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,002
No. You imagined
some generic Marine,

51
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,382
then you placed his face
in the dream after
you saw the picture.

52
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,845
Sort of a coincidence mixed
with a little déja vu.

53
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:19,349
HOUSE: There's no record
of him ever coming
into the clinic,

54
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,185
so I must've seen him
before somewhere else.

55
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,314
Fine. You've known him
since Cub Scouts.

56
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,444
The more interesting question
isn't what you dreamed,
but why.

57
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:30,910
I'm guessing you're longing
for either a renewed
relationship with your dad,

58
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,457
or a new relationship
with one of
the Village People.

59
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,419
He was in the Navy,
not the Marines.

60
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:38,756
I thought your dad
was in the Marines.

61
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:40,968
The guy in
the Village People.

62
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,514
<i>Actually he's only in the Navy
when they sing In the Navy.</i>

63
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:46,644
The rest of the time
he's just in generic fatigue.

64
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:49,107
What?

65
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:51,611
You brought it up!

66
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,659
You didn't flush.
I didn't pee.

67
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:03,297
Male, 34, just got out
of the Marines
after two years in Iraq.

68
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:05,634
Admitted complaining
of chronic fatigue,

69
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:09,099
joint pains,
intermittent rashes
and sore throats.

70
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,851
Thinks he has
Gulf War syndrome.

71
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,145
Why is he here
instead of the VA?

72
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,192
Because he has a rich uncle
Cuddy's trying to
avoid fellating,

73
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:18,406
who doesn't buy
the VA's diagnosis
of nothingswrongatosis.

74
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:19,700
The VA's right.

75
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:21,411
FOREMAN:
There's no such thing
as Gulf War syndrome,

76
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:23,623
especially in veterans
who've never served
in the Gulf War.

77
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,125
Different war, same place.

78
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,546
CHASE: Whatever was there
in 1990 is still there.

79
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:29,341
What's there can send you home
in a pine box

80
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:31,886
but it can't make you
sick three months
after you've gotten home.

81
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,392
What, so thousands of soldiers
are lying about
their symptoms?

82
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:38,439
You send 700,000 people
on a vacation to Hawaii,

83
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:39,608
some are gonna come back sick.

84
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:41,861
Doesn't mean it was
caused by snorkeling.
He's right.

85
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:43,948
The studies all show
the same pattern of
symptoms in veterans

86
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:46,285
who were sent to the Gulf
and those who weren't.

87
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:47,329
That's it?

88
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:48,706
You believe her but not me?

89
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,543
Stick to your guns, Chase.

90
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,588
Just 'cause there isn't
a single unifying symptom

91
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:54,257
doesn't mean there isn't
something going on.

92
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,718
It could just affect
everyone differently.

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,846
You think this guy has
Gulf War syndrome?

94
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,140
Of course not.

95
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,436
He's depressed
and he's looking for
a disability check,

96
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,608
most likely because he's
just realized that knowing
how to barter for sex

97
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:07,404
in six languages
and open a beer bottle
with your eye socket

98
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:09,032
are not the most
marketable skills.

99
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:10,159
Why did you take
this case?

100
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:12,120
'Cause a good scientist
continually questions

101
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:14,165
his own theories
and assumptions.

102
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,003
Cuddy's making him.
And now I'm making you.

103
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,925
Do a full physical
and recheck his blood
for HIV, hep C,

104
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:22,679
malaria, schistosomiasis,
and T strain A. Baumannii,

105
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:24,766
just to make sure
the VA's dotted their I's.

106
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,104
And find out
every hospital and clinic
he's ever visited,

107
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:32,154
every city he's ever lived in
and whether he's
ever been on TV.

108
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:33,489
TV?

109
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,618
Problem could be neurological.

110
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,997
Everyone knows
TV rots your brain.

111
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,755
Well, it's usually the worst
on my palms and
the bottom of my feet.

112
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:45,760
I get these
black dots all over.

113
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:48,556
I don't see anything.
It comes and goes.

114
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,352
You're sure it's not
just scrapes and bruises.

115
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,691
I know the difference between
a rash and a bruise.

116
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:57,362
Sometimes it's harder than
you realize to distinguish
between the two.

117
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:59,073
You obviously exercise.

118
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:00,659
My problems aren't caused
by my workouts.

119
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:02,120
But you do work out.

120
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,998
And by the look of you,
pretty strenuously.

121
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,002
That's not usually
the case with patients

122
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:08,381
whose principal complaint
is chronic fatigue
and joint pain.

123
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:12,053
I was in the Marines for
12 years. I'm used to
doing PT every day.

124
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:14,725
Just because I can
push through the pain
doesn't mean it's not there.

125
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,477
CHASE: We're not saying
we don't believe you.

126
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,980
The hell you aren't.

127
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:21,486
We just need
to be specific about
what exactly the problems are.

128
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:26,619
I sleep 10 hours a night
but I feel tired all the time.

129
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:29,583
I constantly get coughs,
rashes, sore throats.

130
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:32,755
My knees and hips
feel like someone poured
sand in my joints.

131
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:34,925
Get these weird tingling
sensations in my legs.

132
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:39,015
Sometimes they're cold.
Other times, feels
like my blood is boiling.

133
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:41,311
Specific enough?

134
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,776
Look, I don't care
what you guys call it.

135
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:49,574
Gulf War syndrome, Iraq fever,
or just crappy sickness X.

136
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:53,456
I just want someone to
figure out what it is
so they can cure it.

137
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,419
Except for the supposed
pain in his joints,

138
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:59,048
none of the other symptoms
he's complaining about
are currently evident.

139
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:01,386
And besides low potassium,
probably caused by him

140
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,013
over-hydrating
after working out.

141
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:04,307
His blood work's all normal.

142
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:07,938
Low potassium could also
probably be caused by
the experimental vaccines

143
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,319
and anti-chemical
warfare pills he was given
before he deployed to Iraq.

144
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:13,072
Not to mention the fact
that whole country
is littered

145
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:16,619
with hundreds of tons of
radioactive shrapnel from
depleted uranium munitions.

146
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:19,875
You go to medical school
in France? There's no trace of
uranium in his urine.

147
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,003
And he was given the vaccines
and meds two years ago

148
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,382
without any allergic
or adverse reaction.

149
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,469
Has he ever done
any modeling?

150
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:28,180
We forgot to ask.

151
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:30,100
We should send
his urine to
the University of Leicester.

152
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:31,352
There's a professor there
who's developed

153
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,356
a more advanced
screening technique
for uranium.

154
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:38,280
If the levels are too low for
us to detect, they're way too
low to cause any damage.

155
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:40,493
Where are you going?

156
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:42,371
This way.

157
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:45,125
You find out about
any television or
other media exposure?

158
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,462
Do you really care
or are you just trying to
waste hospital resources

159
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:49,591
to get back at Cuddy
for making you take the case?

160
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,260
Of course, I care.

161
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,389
What a horrible thing to say.

162
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:55,977
Do a Lexis-Nexis search
and get a copy
of his credit report.

163
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,900
Before or after we tell him to
eat a banana and discharge him
with a psych referral?

164
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:00,985
I say before.

165
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:03,823
And I say in between
give him a polysomnogram.

166
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:07,162
Sleep apnea could cause
chronic fatigue and paranoia.

167
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,917
And find out where he went
to summer camp.

168
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:14,466
You okay?

169
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:17,137
Yeah. Just a little too
much coffee this morning.

170
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:20,017
Were we walking you to
the bathroom?

171
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,144
I wish.

172
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:26,319
Wilson was just in there.
These guys know
what I'm talking about.

173
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,245
CAMERON: That's his third
REM cycle and his breathing's
completely normal.

174
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,332
There's obviously
nothing wrong with
his sleep pattern.

175
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,087
CHASE: If it's not the
uranium, it's got to be
some other sort of toxin.

176
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,464
Or nothing at all.

177
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:41,803
You really think there's
something wrong, or you just
want Foreman to be wrong?

178
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,055
Both.

179
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:44,558
Well, it's not
his sleep pattern.

180
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:47,521
If you really think
it's a toxin, you can do
a liver biopsy in the morning.

181
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:48,815
We can't leave.

182
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:51,528
If we don't monitor
the whole test, House won't
accept the results.

183
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:52,654
He'll just make us
do it over.

184
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:53,948
It doesn't take two doctors
to monitor

185
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:56,828
what's clearly gonna be
a normal polysomnogram.

186
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,124
Oh, so you want me to stay?

187
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,626
You're the one that thought
there was something wrong.

188
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,421
I never said
it was a sleep disorder.

189
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:04,132
You wanna flip for it?

190
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:05,426
(SCOFFS)

191
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,721
Just go.

192
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:11,477
Oh, come on. Don't be a baby.

193
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:16,361
Fine. I'll stay.

194
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,165
You know what we could do?

195
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:30,634
Here?
Why not?

196
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:32,638
We're surrounded by
empty rooms with beds in them.

197
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:35,100
Yeah.
And video cameras, too.

198
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,104
So we turn them off.
Yeah, that's all I need is

199
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:38,731
House or Foreman
walking in on us.

200
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:40,317
We have the keys.

201
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:44,366
No. What if he wakes up?

202
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:45,701
All right.

203
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:51,711
Suit yourself.

204

(SIGHING)

205
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,578
Damn it.

206
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:59,073
<i>Hello?
Is anybody out there?</i>

207
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:03,247
<i>I think there's
a problem in here!</i>

208
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:07,504
What's wrong?

209
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:10,050
What do you mean,
"What's wrong?"
You don't smell that?

210
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:11,260
Nothing smells, John.

211
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:13,681
Oh, are you kidding me?
It's disgusting.

212
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:16,519
How long have
you thought... Wait.

213
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:19,441
Open your mouth.

214
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:25,826
The smell's not in the room.
It's in your mouth.

215
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,750
What's going on?

216
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,087
Good question.

217
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:56,461

00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:09,524
What?

220
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:12,070
You were wrong about
the nothingswrongatosis.

221
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,740
You can fake fatigue
and joint pain,

222
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:16,494
but you can't fake
bacterial vaginosis
in your mouth.

223
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:17,538
<i>HOUSE.: Where's his mouth been?</i>

224
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,958
Says he hasn't performed
oral sex on anyone
in over a year.

225
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:22,170
Selfish bastard.

226
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:25,134
Because he hasn't been with
anyone since his last
girlfriend dumped him

227
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:26,970
after he deployed to Iraq
the second time.

228
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,222
Selfish bitch.

229
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:32,479
We've ruled out HIV, diabetes
and any other endocrine
abnormality.

230
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,733
Could be autoimmune.
Sjögren's decreases

home for bacteria.

232
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:38,072
No. His eyes and tear ducts
are fine.

233
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:39,449
Who was his last girlfriend?

234
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,579
Yeah, we'll get right on that.

235
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:46,711
Chronic fatigue, joint pain
and opportunistic infection
spells cancer.

236
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,130
Probably lymphoma.

237
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:51,219
<i>FOREMAN.:
We should biopsy his tonsilar
and submandibular lymph nodes.</i>

238
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,639
Right about cancer,
wrong about lymphoma.

239
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,853
<i>Unless you're simply hiding
the fact that his lymph
nodes are swollen.</i>

240
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:00,860
Get Wilson to biopsy
his salivary glands.
He's got parotid cancer.

241
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:03,197
And see if you can
get to the truth about
who he's been dating.

242
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:06,619
<i>No way, a Marine goes a year
without getting some blood
on his bayonet.</i>

243
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:08,539
It's not an STD.
You just said...

244
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:09,583
Just do it.

245
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:15,593
The antibiotics should
at least relieve
the infection,

246
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:17,846
which will reduce the odor
and taste in your mouth.

247
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,432
Not soon enough.

248
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:26,611
All right.
You're gonna feel
a little burn.

249
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:29,282
You know I never even dipped?

250
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,621
Chewing tobacco.
Practically everyone
in my unit did it.

251
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,043
But me. I was so paranoid
about cancer.

252
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:41,427
Well, if it's parotid cancer,
it's very treatable
if diagnosed early.

253
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:46,060
My mom had cancer,
which is why I know that
diagnosing cancer early

254
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:48,815
means before
there's any serious symptoms.

255
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,995
Certainly tastes like
a pretty serious symptom,
you know?

256
00:14:57,037 --> 00:14:59,291
We'll know more
after the test.

257
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,421
If he was just trying to
mess with Cuddy
for wasting his time,

258
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:05,301
this would have stopped as
soon as the patient started
exhibiting actual symptoms.

259
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,805
So the question is,
why is he wasting our time?

260
00:15:07,888 --> 00:15:09,391
Or is he wasting our time?

261
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:12,396
You think he's got a medical
reason for asking for
the guy's credit report?

262
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,648
I don't.

263
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,820
Where were you two
when the guy woke up?

264
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:21,452
We just stepped out
for a second.

265
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,205
To do what?

266
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:26,878
To get a coffee.
We'd been up
most of the night.

267
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,132
He's just pushing to make sure
we have a complete history.

268
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:32,721
Obviously we're missing
something or
we'd have the answer.

269
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:35,643
You didn't have any coffee
when you came back.

270
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,190
All right already.
We confess.
You caught us.

271
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,110
We snuck into one of
the sleep lab rooms
to have sex.

272
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:43,656
We shouldn't have done it
while we were working
and we're sorry.

273
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,367
Now can we move on?

274
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:50,543
House would do Wilson
before you'd do Chase.

275
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:54,174
No. You would do
House and Wilson
before I'd do Chase.

276
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:56,845
Now can we
get back to work.

277
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:58,264
She did me once.

278
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,601
She was stoned!

279
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:13,915
Biopsy's inconclusive.

280
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:17,003
I'm gonna do a sialogram
while we wait for results from
the additional blood work.

281
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,089
No hurry.

282
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,800
Probably nothing we can do
at this point anyway.

283
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:21,386
As long as
the cancer hasn't spread...

284
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:24,850
He's spitting stink.
You should focus
on the living.

285
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:27,688
I need a prescription.

286
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,691
I just wrote you
a prescription.

287
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:32,112
For Vicodin.
I need alfuzosin.

288
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:33,865
No, you don't.

289
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:36,619
You figured out
where you met your Marine?

290
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:37,746
What?

291
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,169
Oh, that. Haven't really
thought about it.

292
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:43,715
I can't pee.

293
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,259
You can't remember him,
can you?

294
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:46,720
I can't pee.

295
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:48,389
So stop taking the Vicodin.

296
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:50,476
I want to pee
and not be in pain.

297
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,145
Why don't you go to sleep?

298
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:53,481
I don't pee when I'm asleep.

299
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:56,486
Maybe you'll dream about him
again. Maybe he'll give you
an address.

300
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:57,988
I haven't peed in three days.

301
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:00,868
I read that REM sleep is
the brain's way of
working out problems.

302
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:02,746
Very useful.
Did you hear
what I just said?

303
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,876
Yeah. You lied because
you want to avoid talking
about your obsession.

304
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,464
I'm not obsessing.
Why don't you just ask him?

305
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:11,052
I haven't peed in three days!
You'd be dead.

306
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:13,055
I'm not counting
intermittent drips.

307
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:14,224
You'd be in agony.

308
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,519
I passed agony
yesterday around 4:00.

309
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:35,718
His mother, brother,
uncle and best friend

310
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,264
all confirm he hasn't had
a date in over a year.

311
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:40,058
Which means it's not an STD.

312
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,189
If you come up with something
medically relevant, page me.

313
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:50,576
What did you want me
to tell him? The truth?

314
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:54,082
No. You didn't have
to be so convincing.

315
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:56,294
Don't worry.
I'll make it up to you.

316
00:17:57,963 --> 00:18:00,008
This is getting
out of control.

317
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:01,177
Don't pout.

318
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:05,476
Our patient woke up with
an infection while we were
getting our rocks off.

319
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:08,982
Do you want to stop?

320
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,234
No.

321
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:12,780
But I don't want to
get caught, either.

322
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:14,282
You think I do?

323
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,619
You certainly didn't
go out of your way to
keep the volume down

324
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:17,788
when we were
in the sleep lab.

325
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:19,624
I couldn't help that.

326
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:24,007
Why would I
want to get caught?

327
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:27,220
Maybe you want to give House
a reason to be jealous.

328
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,599
I'm over House.

329
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:33,481
All this is, is uncomplicated
sex. Don't try to make it
more than that.

330
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:35,943
We're not doing it
at work anymore.

331
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:37,780
Fine.

332
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,965
Wanna go grab some lunch?

333
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:55,601
I think the pill
is the way to go.

334
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:57,521
We haven't had
a condom break yet.
Thank God.

335
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:01,402
But it's bound to happen,
especially the way
we've been doing it.

336
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,908
On a bed of nails?
No.

337
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:08,790
He's not kinky.
He's just insatiable.

338
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:12,003
I can barely make it
to any of my morning classes.

339
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:15,509
You smoke?
No way.

340
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:17,930
Stop it!

341
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:19,725
Sorry.

342
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:24,816
Any history of hypertension,
blood clots, strokes?

343
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,780
Nope. Besides my OCD,
I'm fit as a fiddle.

344
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:33,456
You have OCD?
Can't you tell?

345
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:36,795
Any other compulsions
besides drinking massive
amounts of water?

346
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:38,339
No, that's it.
Thank God.

347
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:40,467
My therapist says
it could be a lot worse.

348
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,262
You get up in the middle
of the night to drink?

349
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,432
Yeah. Every couple of hours.

350
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,895
Then your therapist
is an idiot.

351
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,107
Unconscious people
don't have OCD.

352
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,444
They can, whoever,
have diabetes insipidus.

353
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:54,366
That's impossible.
I eat candy all the time.

354
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:57,913
Different kind of diabetes.
This kind is caused
by banged up pituitary.

355
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,708
You're obviously more of
a lover than a fighter.

356
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:04,549
I'm guessing either a car
accident or you cracked your
skull on the balance beam.

357
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:07,387
How'd you know?

358
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:11,728
Easy. Nice ass. No boobs.
And you've got palms
like a longshoreman.

359
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,773
Wait here.
You need a CAT scan.

360
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:15,860
Oh, my God...
Don't worry.

361
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:19,700
Just means you'll be taking
two hormone supplements
instead of one.

362
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,376
<i>(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

363
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,296
Okay, this time
you're gonna feel
a little pressure.

364
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:29,508
We're injecting
the contrast material.

365
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,389
Could you turn up the music?

366
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:34,641
Sure.

(VOLUME INCREASING)

368
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,444
Looks pretty good so far.

369
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,698
Still can't hear it that well.

370
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:47,538
(VOLUME INCREASING)

371
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,291
Can you hear it now?

00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,210
John?

373
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:54,382
John!

374
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:57,220
John, can you hear me?

375
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,267
(DOOR OPENING)

376
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:04,649
Still no relief?

377
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:06,235
I got relief.

378
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:07,988
I just got no pee.

379
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:10,659
If the pills didn't work,
you may need a catheter.

380
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:12,997
You didn't come here
to talk to me about my pee.

381
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,624
What's going on?

382
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:17,003
He's got cancer all right.

383
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:20,301
But it's not in
his salivary glands.
It's in his brain.

384
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:24,892
And it's bad.
At least six tumors.
Maybe more.

385
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,109
He lost his hearing.
His sight's probably next.

386
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:32,821
Death is probably next.

387
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:38,414
HOUSE: No way he could've
grown all these in a week.

388
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:41,377
They can't be older.
The VA couldn't have
missed all these.

389
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,798
Maybe they didn't miss them.
Just mixed them up.

390
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:46,803
Switched his films with
another patient's by mistake.

391
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:48,180
Maybe.

392
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:52,104
It'd mean some poor sap's
getting his melon sliced
at the VA for no reason.

393
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:55,484
And this poor sergeant's
gonna be dead
by the end of the week.

394
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:58,281
Where've you two been?
CAMERON: Lunch.

395
00:21:58,364 --> 00:21:59,825
Why? What happened?

396
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:04,082
Wilson's found some
fast-growing, elusive
or magic brain tumors.

397
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:05,459
What did you find?

398
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,713
Nothing.
He's telling the truth.

399
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,092
About what?
CHASE: About everything.

400
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:11,720
Where he's lived,
who he's dated.

401
00:22:11,803 --> 00:22:14,057
Besides forgetting to mention
his dad's shin splints,

402
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,229
his granddad's nosebleeds,
and to return
a few rented DVDs,

403
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:19,107
everything he's told us
has checked out.

404
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,486
You have them
researching your dream?

405
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,157
No. I have them
researching my patient.

406
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:26,494
You had a dream
about a patient?

407
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:31,210
This poor guy's brain is
riddled with tumors and you're
checking his credit report?

408
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:36,469
Come on. I need you guys.

409
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,848
Where are you going?
To do my job.

410
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:40,309
He's not your patient.

411
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,396
He is now.
Go home and go to sleep.

412
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:45,526
Maybe you'll dream a cure
to late-stage brain cancer.

413
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,459
How is he?

414
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:57,379
He's dead.

415
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:00,801
Oh, God.
At least he will be
in a few days.

416
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:04,307
Question is why.

417
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:07,437
The only explanation is that
the VA hospital screwed up.

418
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:10,401
There was definitely
no mix up.
I had them recheck.

419
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:14,825
Yes. Why would
a government agency lie
to cover up a mistake

420
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:16,411
that might have caused
the death of a guy

421
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:18,456
they'd been trying to kill
for the last two years anyway?

422
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,084
They didn't lie.

423
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:23,422
Did you just take
two Vicodin?

424
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,467
No. Just an antidepressant.

425
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:28,639
I was told to
take two every time
you walked into the room.

426
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:34,357
The VA's scan of his brain.
No tumors.

427
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:39,700
Yes. This is proof positive
that someone didn't have
tumors in their brain.

428
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:42,037
You see that bright spot
below his left orbit?

429
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,459
That is a titanium pin
your patient had inserted
20 years ago.

430
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:48,589
Unless you think the VA
happened to mix up
his scans with someone

431
00:23:48,673 --> 00:23:51,678
who had the exact same pin,
they didn't screw up.

432
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,354
You paged us?

433
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,235
Why didn't you send
his urine to Leicester
like I told you?

434
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,573
Because you told me not to.

435
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:06,035
Why did you choose that moment
to listen to me?

436
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,998
You think depleted uranium
might have something to
do with his tumors?

437
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:11,294
Radiation's the only thing
that will make tumors
grow that fast.

438
00:24:11,377 --> 00:24:13,005
High doses of radiation!

439
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:15,050
Even if he ate
depleted uranium bullets
for breakfast,

440
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:16,594
he still would've been exposed
to less radiation

441
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:18,180
than we've given him
in the last two days.

442
00:24:18,264 --> 00:24:22,145
Do it anyway.
And you, call his uncle back.

443
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:25,818
Find out if he ever brought
his nephew to any hospital
parties or fundraisers.

444
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,239
No. Not until
you give me a reason.

445
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,409
Because I'm your boss?

446
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:31,703
A rational reason.

447
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:33,790
Or at least admit
that you don't have one.

448
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,043
I've got a full bladder
and I'm not afraid to use it.

449
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:37,588
But you are
apparently afraid

450
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,716
of discovering
something you can't
rationally explain...

451
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,010
Shut up!

452
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:43,848
Do what you're told.

453
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,980
Cuddy and Wilson may not have
to listen to me, but you do.

454
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:54,032
What the hell
was that all about?

455
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:55,326
I don't care.

456
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:58,080
Which is why I didn't feel
the need to ask him
eight personal questions.

457
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,583
I'm over him.

458
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:04,090
Just making an observation.

459
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:09,307
WILSON: All right.
Ready whenever you are.

460
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:10,476
I'm ready.

461
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:15,902
Wait a minute. Zoom in.

462
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:21,786
I don't see it.
You sure you got
the right coordinates?

463
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:24,374
Yeah. She's in
the right place.

464
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:28,005
Go 10 millimeters
above the AC-PC line
on the Z axis.

465
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:30,342
TECHNICIAN:
Ten mil above AC-PC on Z.

466
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:34,057
It's not there anymore.

467
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,685
Are you sure you got
the gantry angle right?

468
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,523
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's not there.

469
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:42,404
It disappeared.

470
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:44,282
Six tumors don't
just disappear.

471
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,119
Unless they were
never there to begin with.

472
00:25:46,202 --> 00:25:47,705
The VA didn't screw up.

473
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:49,207
Maybe someone else did.

474
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,835
Maybe it was
Dr. Self-Righteous.

475
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:53,422
I saw the tumors.
There was no mix up.

476
00:25:53,506 --> 00:25:55,843
Maybe there's something
wrong with the
portable imager in the OR.

477
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:58,514
Something that would cause it
to show brain tissue
in perfect detail

478
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,935
but completely miss
neoplastic tissue?

479
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,855
Then they were
never tumors to begin with.

480
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,023
I told you I saw...

481
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:08,531
Oh, you saw something
that looked like tumors.
We all did. We were all wrong.

482
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:09,616
Or maybe he doesn't
have cancer.

483
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:12,162
Maybe he has a brain
infection that's causing
multiple abscesses.

484
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:13,539
That miraculously healed?

485
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:15,167
No. They were healed
by the antibiotics

486
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,003
we're giving him for
the vaginosis in his mouth.

487
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:20,301
If it's an infection,
why didn't it show up
in his blood work?

488
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:22,262
I don't know yet.

489
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:25,100
Dr. Wilson,
we have a problem.

490
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:27,396
What did you do?

491
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,775
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

492
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:30,818
John...
What did you guys do?

493
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,279
John! Calm down!
We didn't even operate.

494
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:33,573
Could this be
a regional effect?

495
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:35,659
I can't move my legs!
ANESTHESIOLOGIST:
It's not the anesthesia.

496
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:37,412
HOUSE: John! John!

497
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:38,915
We're gonna figure out
what's wrong with you.

498
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:44,925
But first we need to know
one thing, have you ever
appeared in any pornos?

499
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,311
Chronic fatigue,
sore throats, rashes,

500
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:54,399
putrid discharge in the mouth,
multiple abscesses
in the brain,

501
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:58,865
hearing loss,
and last but not least,
lower limb paralysis.

502
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:00,785
He's certainly given us
plenty of clues.

503
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:03,122
It's got to be
some sort of infection.

504
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:07,254
That's miraculously improving
in his brain but getting worse
in his ears and legs?

505
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:09,508
Could be an infection
and cancer.

506
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:11,970
A neoplastic syndrome
could depress
his immune system

507
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:13,514
and cause the other symptoms.

508
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,726
You're basing this theory
on the negative biopsy,

509
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:17,396
the lymph nodes
that aren't swollen,

510
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:19,733
or the tumors that were
never there to begin with?

511
00:27:19,816 --> 00:27:21,528
And what are you gonna base
your theory on?

512
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:23,531
His favorite restaurants?

513
00:27:24,115 --> 00:27:25,284
I was right.

514
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:28,414
He's excreting depleted
uranium in his urine.

515
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:31,294
We should start him on
an IV infusion of isotonic
sodium bicarbonate...

516
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:32,838
It's not depleted uranium.

517
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:34,048
You're the one...
Who asked for the test

518
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:36,135
when we were thinking cancer.
We no longer are.

519
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:38,389
Depleted uranium doesn't just
cause cells to mutate.

520
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:39,683
It can cause
cell death as well.

521
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,394
Not spinal cord cells.

522
00:27:41,478 --> 00:27:44,733
At least not before the dose
is high enough to kill
all his other cells first.

523
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:48,322
So you're saying the
radioactive uranium in
his urine is irrelevant.

524
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:51,244
The sun's radioactive.
The earth is radioactive.

525

This hospital is filled
with radiation.

526
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,127
The issue is not where it is,
but how much there is,

527
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,299
and what damage
that amount can cause
in someone's spinal cord.

528
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:01,887
As I've already
stated quite clearly.

529

ride a motorcycle with
a distended bladder?

check his hearing

533

want us to do nothing?

No. I basically
want to do nothing.

Isn't here.

...he wanted us to
start this treatment,

bicarb to try to flush
the uranium out of his system.

578

Great. Now the fact that
he's getting worse

minor trauma or dry weather.

and veins merging together.

00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:24,658
(HUMMING)

668
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,998
Well, looks like
solving the case
solved your other problem.

669
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:32,796
There is no medicine
like happiness.
Except maybe laughter.

670
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:35,885
Or rubber tubes
shoved up your urethra.

671
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:37,972
You cathed yourself?

672
00:37:38,013 --> 00:37:42,020
It's actually not that bad
after the first, I don't know,
9 or 10 inches.

673
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:44,816
The cath relieved the spasm.
I'm good as new.

674
00:37:44,858 --> 00:37:49,115
Of course. Just a minor spasm
in a muscle you've been using
multiple times a day

675
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:51,703
without any problems
for the past 45 years.

676
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:56,711
Not a major side effect caused
by the overuse of a particular
narcotic painkiller.

677
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:58,548
Yeah.
That was my thought, too.

678
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:03,806
So, no reason to think about
cutting back on your use
of that particular pill.

679
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,267
Thank God!

680
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:07,145
Actually, it was
the triple dose
of the good stuff

681
00:38:07,229 --> 00:38:10,902
that allowed me to
finally get some sleep
and solve the case.

682
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:13,114
Pills made all my dreams
come true.

683
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:15,826
You really got the answer
in your sleep?

684
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:19,458
I got one in my sleep.
The other one
I got in the shower.

685
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:27,596
I've been thinking about you.

686
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,184
You lied.

687
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:31,937
I didn't lie.

688
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,776
I simply chose not to share
completely irrelevant facts.

689
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,905
Like the fact that you lied.

690
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:40,618
No wonder I couldn't
place his face.

691
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,955
You were practically
swallowing it
on the dance floor.

692
00:38:43,038 --> 00:38:44,291
I was not.

693
00:38:44,374 --> 00:38:45,835
Talk about the cool uncle.

694
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:49,174
He donates the money
and the nephew
gets the write-off.

695
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:51,636
And of course, by write-off,
I mean he gets
to put your ankles...

696
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,601
This is exactly why
I didn't mention our one date
over two years ago.

697
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:58,690
Because of my T-shirt.

698
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:01,069
Because you are
an obnoxious ass.

699
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:03,239
Because you would have
spent the whole time...

700
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:04,282
That's very smart.

701
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:07,412
'Cause this way I spent
the whole time completely
focused on the patient.

702
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:08,790
How did you even
remember him?

703
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:10,710
We were only at that party
for like 10 minutes!

704
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,421
Is this a new health plan?

705
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:15,885
Service the Dean of Medicine,
you get free health care
for a year?

706
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:19,349
Why are you smiling?

707
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:22,855
You remembered him
because he made out with me.

708
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,776
I'm good with faces.

709
00:39:25,818 --> 00:39:28,573
So this plan,
is it open to anyone?
Is there a co-pay?

710
00:39:28,656 --> 00:39:30,033
You're lousy with faces.

711
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,997
Don't make this about me.
This is your humiliation.

712
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,626
So how much for
private room coverage?

713
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,421
Get over me.

714
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,217
Give me a break.
You hired me...

715
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:42,805
'Cause you're a good doctor
who couldn't get himself
hired at a blood bank,

716
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:44,391
so I got you cheap.

717
00:39:44,474 --> 00:39:47,855
You gave me everything
I asked for because one night
I gave you everything...

718
00:39:47,938 --> 00:39:51,027
Stop staring at my ass
when you think
I'm not looking,

719
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:53,740
showing up at restaurants
where I happen
to be on a date,

720
00:39:53,781 --> 00:39:56,411
and fantasizing about me
in the shower.

721
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,790
That ship sailed
long ago, House.

722
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:00,751
Get over it.

723
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:04,007
If you're still referring
to your ass,

724
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:07,972
I think that supertanker
sailed would be
the more precise metaphor.

725
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,862
Sorry.

726
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:44,658
Just looking for
an extra-large trashcan.

727
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:52,796
Since when does
he clean anything up?
