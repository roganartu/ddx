1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,720
Try not to be scared
when you see him, okay?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,720
Mom, I've seen him sick.
I'm not scared.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,960
This time's different.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,160
The doctors gave him
an extra course of
radiation and chemo...

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,560
I know.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,160
And you understand
how proud we are of you,
right?

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
Gloves, mask.

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,920
Matty, you said you wanted
to see your brother
before the procedure.

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,520
I know I look like an alien,
but I promise not to eat
your brain.

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,160
(CHUCKLES)

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,840
When this is done,
will you be able to
play out back with me?

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,160
I'll rip anything you
put near the strike zone.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,560
Let your brother rest up,
while we take
some of your marrow.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,120
You don't need to be
in an isolation room,

15
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,320
but I pulled some strings
so you could be next door
to your brother.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,800
How many games will I miss?

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,440
Well, you only have to
be here overnight,

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
but you do have to
take it easy for a little bit.

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,320
I already missed two.
Matty...

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,040
I know. It's okay.

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,800
It must have been a drag.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,920
We just had to make sure
you weren't exposed
to any bugs,

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,040
because your healthy bone
marrow is what's gonna cure
your brother's leukemia.

24
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,120
(GROWLS)

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160
Go on.

26
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,800
(BARKING)

27
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,680
CHASE: He sneezed.
Maybe it's just an allergy.

28
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,880
Not with an enlarged spleen
and a fever.

29
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
WILSON: He's got one of 10,000
possible infections,

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,920
even if it's just the common
cold, I do the transplant,
he kills his brother.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,960
How long do we have?

32
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,920
Radiation obliterated
his immune system.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,360
Even in a clean room,
he's got four, maybe five,
days left.

34
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,240
No way we can solve this
that fast. You need to find
another donor.

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,360
They're African American.

36
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,480
It makes it nearly impossible
to find a full match.

37
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,840
Tell me about it.
I can't even find the one
I've got working for me.

38
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,480
Where is Foreman?

39
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,240
Nothing like a dead patient
to send you back
to your choir boy roots.

40
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,720
Hey, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

41
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,840
Wilson just killed a kid
same way you did.

42
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,120
He's not dead.

43
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,400
Five days are gonna fly by.
He didn't look both ways
before he nuked.

44
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,880
You done talking to
your imaginary friend?

45
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,880
Because I thought, maybe,
you could do
your job and just...

46
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,800
Start the donor brother
on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

47
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Great idea,
if you're looking to
save exactly one kid.

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,120
Broad-spec will take
at least a week to work.
We need narrow-spec.

49
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,160
How old is Hector?

50
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,080
Our patient's name is Matty.
His brother's Nick.

51
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,520
Hector's my dog.
He's about 17?

52
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,520
Seventeen? That's, like,
a 119 in human years.
Why is he still alive?

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,760
Five days minus 20 seconds
talking about Wilson's dog.

54
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,760
We need to start testing.
Stool samples for parasites,
antibody tests...

55
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,760
Blood panel was negative
for all the usual suspects.

56
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
That's because the
infection is too small.

57
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,600
We start testing now,
it's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

58
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,360
We draw blood odds are
we're just gonna
come up with hay.

59
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,600
We need to
grow more needles.

60
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Okay, that probably needs
further explanation.

61
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,520
We make the donor kid sicker.

62
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,960
We freeze him, we soak him,
break down his immune system.

63
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,240
Suddenly we're looking at
some needle that a camel
can pass through the eye of.

64
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,160
Making him sicker risks
spreading the infection
all throughout his body.

65
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,920
True, but who cares?

66
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,360
Once we know what
the infection is, we'll know
exactly how to treat it.

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,080
As long as he isn't dead yet,
we're cool.

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,560
We should do
what we normally do.

69
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Go to the kid's house,
check for sources
of the infection.

70
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,200
Waste of time.

71
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,720
You think it's in the house.
I know it's in the patient.

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,640
Safer than
intentionally making
the kid sicker.

73
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
Fine, go.

74
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,120
So exactly how sick
are you gonna make Matty?

75
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,520
He could get quite ill.

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,640
It certainly won't be a
pleasant experience for
anyone, but it's our only...

77
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,360
Ever get caught in the rain
without an umbrella?

78
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
That's all we're
talking about here.
Sign the form.

79
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,120
It's a little more complicated
than that. We'll also be
doing leukopheresis.

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,000
We run Matty's blood through
a machine that filters out
his white blood cells.

81
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,520
But without his white cells,
how could he get better
in time?

82
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,440
We'll pump the white
blood cells back as soon as
we have a diagnosis.

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,040
Then we should be able to cure
the infection in time
to do the transplant.

84
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,280
But you can't guarantee?

85
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,200
We're not GM.
No recalls, no rebates.

86
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
Anymore questions
while your son's life
slips away?

87
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
You really think
we should do this?

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,320
Yes.

89
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160
Sorry. Your patient,
you tell them.

90
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,280
This is your family.
It needs to be your decision.

91
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,800
All you had to do was
say, "Yes, I do."

92
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,400
God knows it's a phrase
that you've used
often enough in your life.

93
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,320
It was a mistake every time.
Give it a break.
They said yes.

94
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,680
That's not enough for you.
You need them to feel good
about saying yes.

95
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,640
I treat patients for months,
maybe years,
not weeks, like you.

96
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,640
I'm taller.

97
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,240
If they don't trust me,
I can't do my job.

98
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,960
The only value of that trust
is that you can
manipulate them.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,240
You should write
greeting cards.

100
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,040
Giving the parents a chance
to make a bad choice
was a bad choice.

101
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,480
At least it would have
been their choice.

102
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,520
One they'd regret
at their son's funeral.

103
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,120
Kitchen and bathrooms were
immaculate. Whatever the kid's
got, he didn't get here.

104
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,040
No, whatever the kid got,
he didn't get from
the kitchen or the bathroom.

105
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,600
Nobody cleans swing sets.

106
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,400
Yeah, because their kid's 10
and hasn't used it
since he was six.

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,280
You obviously think your time
could be better spent.
Why'd you come along?

108
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,000
You feel bad about
what happened last week.

109
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,400
I'm handling it.

110
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,920
Think the family's gonna sue?

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,200
She only had her grandparents,
and they weren't close.

112
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,520
Well, that's good.
For you, I mean.

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,040
A lawsuit makes it even harder
to put behind you.

114
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,080
You put yours behind you?

115
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,080
Nope.

116
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,200
When I woke up
this morning I...

117
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,720
I couldn't remember
what she was wearing
when I admitted her.

118
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,920
Memories fade.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,960
I killed her a week ago and
I can't remember what color
top she was wearing.

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,760
I was grateful when
I could wake up
not thinking about her.

121
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I'm not like you.

122
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,240
Your patient died because
you were distracted
over the death of your dad.

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,160
I made a calculated decision.

124
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,360
You acted like a human being.
I acted like House.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,240
<i>Could be Mucor or
Strongyloides in this dirt.</i>

126
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,120
No pulmonary symptoms,
setting well,
breathing easily.

127
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,960
Mom, I'm freezing.

128
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,200
How long do I have to wait?

129
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,760
Matty, we found
an old water pump
in your backyard.

130
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,800
You ever drink from it?

131
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,600
Yeah it was gross.

132
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,800
We gotta test
for Mycobacteria,
leptospirosis.

133
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,320
When did you drink the water?

134
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,760
Last summer?

135
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,600
You sure?
You haven't even taken
a sip to cool off?

136
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,720
It was really gross.

137
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,160
My shoulder's bugging me.
Does that matter?

138
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,760
It could. Did you
do anything to hurt it?

139
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,200
Just threw the ball around
the other day,
for a couple hours.

140
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,040
It's probably just
a muscle ache.
Let us know if it gets worse.

141
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,640
So soreness and stuff,
that's not 'cause I'm sick?

142
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,040
Is something else bugging you?

143
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,920
Sort of.

144
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,080
He has acute scrotum.
Adorable.

145
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,520
Please, I thought you
were dignified.

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
Come on,
how am I not supposed to
make that joke?

147
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,360
Best thing about big,
honking gonads, well,
one of the best things,

148
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,720
is that there's only
a few infections
that could cause it.

149
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,960
<i>Do urinalysis and cultures for
E. Coli, Klebsiella,
TB, and Brucella.</i>

150
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,640
Blood tests
for enteroviruses
and adenoviruses.

151
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,760
Hopefully, the needles
have grown as fast as
his sack, and we can find it.

152
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Can Chase and Cameron
cover that?

153
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,480
Mind if I ask why?

154
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,200
I want to recheck the
National Marrow registry
for an alternate donor.

155
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,720
In case we're wrong?

156
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,240
It's been known to happen.

157
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,600
Fine, go.

158
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,840
<i>Negative for E. Coli and TB.
Why is House taking
it easy on Foreman?</i>

159
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,840
He deserves a break.

160
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,680
Yeah, House is all about
giving breaks to people
in need.

161
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
<i>No on Klebsiella.</i>

162
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,680
And it's Tuesday.

163
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,240
It's got nothing to do with
Foreman or House. It's just...

164
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,480
It's the day I remind you
I like you, and I want us
to be together.

165
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,360
Thank you, I'd forgotten.

166
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,360
<i>No on Brucella
and both viral antibodies.</i>

167
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,160
You're really gonna
do this every Tuesday?

168
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,160
You take the day off,
I'll pick it up on Wednesday.

169
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,840
What if we're looking for
the wrong thing?

170
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
These are the only infections
that cause swollen testicles.

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,520
Why don't you just say it
four times now and leave me
alone for a month?

172
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,160
Well, what if it's
not an infection?

173
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,440
His temperature's through
the roof. There's mucous
pouring out of him.

174
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,800
I know he has an infection,
but what if it didn't directly
cause the scrotum issue?

175
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,040
What if it just caused
the thing that caused
the scrotum issue?

176
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
CK-MB is elevated.

177
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,760
Slightly.
There's nothing wrong with...

178
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,080
Indicates cardiac injury.

179
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,680
We stuck him in that room, put
his stupid, little runny-nose
infection into hyperdrive.

180
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
What if it went to his heart?

181
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,240
CHASE: Pulmonary valve
looks clean.

182
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,040
Wait. Stop. Mitral valve,
there's a growth.

183
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
He'll need a month
of antibiotics to clear that.

184
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,720
His brother only has
four days to live.

185
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,560
The infection in Matty's
mitral valve rules him out
as a donor.

186
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,680
This is perfect.

187
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,360
We drove the infection
into his heart.

188
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,600
Okay, perfect is too strong
of a word, but it's very,
very good.

189
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,920
Now we know
where the infection is.

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,640
All we've got to do is remove
the valve, ID the infection,
target and destroy it.

191
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,760
Remove the valve?

192
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,480
He'll be fine on antibiotics.
He doesn't need open-heart
surgery.

193
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
He'll be heartbroken,
on account of
his dead brother.

194
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,240
Either way he's got a dead
brother. The infection
isn't just in the valve.

195
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,680
Even with targeted medication,

196
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,440
there's no way
we can clear his system
in time.

197
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,200
We don't have to.
We have to clear his marrow.

198
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,480
After the surgery,
we harvest the marrow,

199
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,840
marinate it in the targeted
antibiotic, simmer and serve.

200
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,680
Could work.
It's insane.

201
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,000
It is better than
a dead brother.

202
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,440
I'm running this by Cuddy.

203
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,560
Fine. Go.
In fact, let's all go.

204
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,440
This surgery is dangerous
and life-altering,

205
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,320
and clearly not in
the interest of our patient.

206
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,760
It is, if he
likes his brother.

207
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,120
We have a conflict
of interests.

208
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,160
WILSON: The parents don't.
FOREMAN: Of course they do.

209
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,080
They already sacrificed
Matty's health to benefit
his brother once.

210
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,600
They made his cold worse.

211
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,960
We screwed up his heart valve
by making his cold worse.

212
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,520
Do you have anything
to add to this debate?

213
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,040
Wilson's right.
Foreman's wrong.

214
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,840
Your shirt is way too
revealing for the office.

215
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,960
What do you want me to do?

216
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,960
We should call child services
and have them appoint
a guardian for Matty.

217
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
No.

218
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,880
Go explain the choices
to the parents, and don't
let House bully them.

219
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,560
House.

220
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,480
Did he really think
I was gonna do that?
I didn't.

221
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,600
Then, why did you let him...

222
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,040
I'm trying to
cut him some slack.

223
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,720
Nice of you.

224
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,360
I think he's got the yips.

225
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,960
Steve Blass, Scott Norwood,
David Duval all got the yips.

226
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,960
Great athletes, lost their
confidence and immediately
started sucking.

227
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,160
And you're giving him time
to work through it?

228
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,920
Four days, and he's fired.

229
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,360
You don't get better
from the yips.

230
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,200
Open-heart surgery?

231
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,320
If you want both kids to live,
it's the only choice.

232
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,800
Due to the valve replacement.

233
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,840
Matty will have to be
on blood thinners
to prevent potential clots.

234
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,280
For how long?
Forever.

235
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,800
He couldn't participate
in contact sports, because of
the risk of hemorrhage.

236
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,600
What about the
marrow registry?
Maybe they'll find a match.

237
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
Maybe they'll ride it here
on a unicorn.

238
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,600
I'm afraid finding
a viable new donor

239
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,800
isn't something we can
realistically depend on.

240
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,280
Either we cripple one son,
or kill the other.

241
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,160
He won't be able to play
baseball. That doesn't
make him a cripple.

242
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,520
What should we do?

243
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,840
You should protect
your family as a whole.
You should do the surgery.

244
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,840
That was awesome.
Shut up.

245
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,520
I gotta start
pretending to care.

246
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,280
I did exactly what
Cuddy told us not to do.

247
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,400
No you didn't.
You did exactly what
she told me not to do.

248
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,400
You're completely
in the clear.

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,520
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

250
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,680
You're actually upset.
You just said
what you believed.

251
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,840
I also believe in patients
making their own choices.

252
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,120
Because it lessens your guilt
if things go wrong.

253
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,920
You're not protecting
their choices. You're
soothing your conscience.

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
By that logic, a sociopath
would make the best patient
advocate in the world.

255
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,000
Am I blushing?

256
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,440
You ready?

257
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,080
Yeah.

258
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,760
Thanks.

259
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,360
You'd do the same for me.

260
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

261
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,400
You think I'll be
better in time to pitch
in the playoffs?

262
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,080
Maybe next season.

263
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,600
We should have told him.

264
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,600
He loves his brother,
but if he understood what
we were asking of him...

265
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,200
He loves his brother more than
he loves baseball.

266
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,200
You did the right thing.

267
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,840
Putting any part
of this decision on him...

268
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,000
It's impossible for you guys
to deal with this.

269
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,440
How's a 10-year-old
supposed to do it?

270
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,920
Canula in place.

271
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,240
Sutures are holding.

272
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,920
We're all set to go.

273
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,200
Switch him over to bypass.

274
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,400
<i>(WOMAN CHATTERING ON TV)</i>

275
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,000
(PHONE RINGING)

276
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Yeah?
I didn't do the surgery.

277
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,480
You woke me up
to tell me that you're lazy?

278
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
We biopsied a piece
before we started cutting.

279
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm tired. Get to the point.

280
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,200
We didn't replace the valve

281
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,920
because the growth
was fibrous tissue.
It wasn't infectious.

282
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,440
<i>We've got to be wrong about...</i>

283
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,760
Oh, God.
What?

284
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,960
<i>You know what's wrong
with Matty?</i>

285
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,640
I think Hector's
committed suicide.

286
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
What are you talking about?

287
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,840
He took some pills.

288
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,360
Is he alive?

289
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,040
He ate half my stash.

290
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,920
Of course he's...

291
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,480
(GRUNTS)

292
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,560
He's stoned. I'll be right in.

293
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,760
We cut all the way
into this kid's heart,

294
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,400
and all we got was this lousy,
non-infectious fibrous tissue.

295
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,960
How did we miss this?

296
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,880
Matty had a fever.
He got sicker when we
suppressed his immune system.

297
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,240
That all points to infection.

298
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not our fault. Fibrous tissue.

299
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,720
Something is turning
his healthy heart valve
into gristle.

300
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,760
Fibrous tissue,
enlarged spleen, fever...
Could mean autoimmune.

301
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,040
Autoimmune diseases
aren't passed along
in bone marrow.

302
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,480
He can still donate.
We confirm, I do the surgery.

303
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,960
Lupus and Behçet's are
our best bet.
Do an ANA and pathergy test.

304
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Or it could be infection.

305
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,840
My memory's not
what it used to be,

306
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,160
but didn't we just
rule that out
eight seconds ago?

307
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,960
Just because it's not
what screwed up his valve,

308
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,400
it doesn't mean
it's not in his system.

309
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,000
Uh-huh, and has the obvious
advantage of making us right
all along.

310
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,120
Little disadvantage
of making big brother dead.

311
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,760
That's your argument?
A better outcome?

312
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
It fits.

313
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,080
The family has one kid
with leukemia
and one with autoimmune.

314
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,560
I wouldn't stand next to them
in a rain storm.

315
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,680
That's your argument?
It sucks for them?

316
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,760
It fits, and we can
still help big brother.

317
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,080
National Marrow Registry
came up with four
out of six donors.

318
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,680
Six out of six is two better
than four out of six, right?

319
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
I mean, I know two
is so small,

320
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,920
but since it means that
he's gonna get
Graft-Versus-Host Disease,

321
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,320
the marrow will
attack his body, and he'll
die a painful death.

322
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,920
Find out what
autoimmune it is.

323
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,360
Is this autoimmune
better or worse than
the new heart valve?

324
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,920
It depends on which autoimmune
it is. With early detection,
most are manageable.

325
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,360
How long will testing take?

326
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,680
That's the other good thing
about this.

327
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,640
There's literally
thousands of
possible infections,

328
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,760
but only a handful of
autoimmune conditions.

329
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,360
We'll have the answer
in a few hours.

330
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,840
NICK: Hey, Doctor?

331
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,080
Is this bad?

332
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,960
Wanna catch a movie?

333
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,320
It's one in the morning.

334
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,920
I know a place.

335
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,760
Although, I wouldn't recommend
wearing those shoes.

336
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,240
How exactly does a dog
unscrew a bottle of pills?

337
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Is that a riddle?

338
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,880
It requires
an opposable thumb.

339
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,000
I must have left it off.

340
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,080
On the floor?

341
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,640
I think he hopped up
onto the bathroom counter.

342
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,040
He has arthritis.

343
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,480
Not me this time.

344
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,040
No! It's your damn dog.

345
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,040
He chews everything.
I was missing a file.
Found paper in his stool.

346
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,000
An original Sun Record 78
Elvis recording, gone.

347
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,760
Who the hell chews vinyl?
He's vindictive.

348
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,840
He's had a good, long life.
It's his time.

349
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,320
Are you okay?

350
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,840
I just tripped over
Wilson's self-righteousness.

351
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,520
What do you got?

352
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,160
Matty's negative
for everything.
It's not autoimmune.

353
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,520
So, we're back to infection.

354
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,720
Nick's starting to deteriorate
fast. He's got bruising
all over his arms.

355
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
His capillaries
are leaking blood.

356
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,640
If it happens in his brain,
he's dead.

357
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,280
We've got to go
with the four-out-of-six
donor.

358
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,880
Did I mention my concerns
about four being less
than six?

359
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,280
Wilson's first wife
ignored a similar issue.

360
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,680
Of course, that time,
it was only fatal
to their marriage.

361
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,400
It's either that, or we start
randomly testing Matty
for infections.

362
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,920
I know how you hate
the word "random."

363
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,680
Do it alphabetically.
We're not doing
that damn transplant.

364
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,920
Where's Foreman?

365
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,480
We've found a donor.

366
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,480
It's not an ideal match,
but four out of six
still gives Nick a chance.

367
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,920
A partial match transplant
is extremely dangerous.

368
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,080
Doctor Foreman explained...

369
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,640
Did he also explain
what sort of pain
your son will experience

370
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,200
if he gets
Graft-Versus-Host Disease?

371
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,400
Yes.

372
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,840
Apparently,
he didn't explain it
vividly enough.

373
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,840
Let me give it a whack...

374
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,360
He also explained that if we
did nothing, Nick could start
bleeding into his brain.

375
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Matty is a perfect match.
Just give us a little more
time to figure out...

376
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
How much time?

377
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,360
Doctor House is
the best diagnostician...

378
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,160
How much time?

379
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,840
I don't know.

380
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,160
And Nick can start
bleeding into his brain
without any warning?

381
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,040
Yes, but the chances of
complications from
a mismatch are...

382
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,080
My boys have suffered enough.

383
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,880
Get Matty better,

384
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,120
and give Nick the transplant
from the new donor.

385
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,160
Foreman screwed us.

386
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,480
No, you screwed us.

387
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,560
What is the point
in being able to
control people

388
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,640
if you won't actually do it?

389
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,200
It's like training a dog and
letting him go on your rug,
which, by the way...

390
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,080
Once Foreman got his mitts
on them, well,
there was no way...

391
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,840
You don't explain chances
and probabilities,
you lie to them.

392
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,680
You tell them Foreman's
a moron, which isn't even
much of a lie right now.

393
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
You've got to talk to him.

394
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,000
I've got no problem
with what Foreman did.

395
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,200
He undercut us,
and he may have cost
that kid his life.

396
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,760
Foreman did what he thought
was right. You, on the
other hand, sucked out.

397
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
When the decision
really mattered,

398
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,840
you didn't have the guts
to tell them what to do.

399
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,200
If that kid dies,
it's because Foreman
was wrong,

400
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,320
and because you're a coward.

401
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, goodness,
I've left my door open.

402
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:38,880
My poor dog must have
run away and been hit by
a car or a truck or a train.

403
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,840
Or an anvil.

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,760
A little itchy.

It's weird, huh?

You still have no idea
what's wrong with me,

make me better.

We put you on a variety
of medications that will fight
all kinds of infections.

415

Nick, you know exactly
what's wrong with him,

416
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,240
but maybe he's gonna die,
anyway.

Hopefully,
the new marrow will...

I can't go in there, can I?

419
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,280
Your infection would kill him.

420
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,440
So, I won't be able to
be with him when he dies?

421

You'll be able to be with him

at a medical supply store

Schistocytes on the smear?

Marilyn Manson

his bone marrow.

We need to stop Matty's meds.

460

it's the meds. If it doesn't,
it's an infection.

We know what he has.
We know how to treat it.

We're doing it,
it's not working.
Life is for the living.

478
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,360
Matty's been off his meds
for a few hours, but his
blood count's still tanking.

479
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,520
Means the meds
aren't to blame.
It's the infection.

480
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,600
If we don't get this
under control, his blood will
literally turn into water.

481
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,080
Cultures still
aren't growing anything.

482
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,120
Why not?

483
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,560
Because you did the
right thing. Convinced
the parents to treat the kid.

484
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,520
All you did
was yank the weed
out of the ground.

485
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,080
Its roots are still killing
their beautiful lawn.
We just can't see it.

486
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,840
If we can't see it,
we don't know what it is.

487
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,840
If we don't know what it is,
we can't kill it.

488
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,160
So we got to wait for it
to grow back again.

489
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,720
Now, the soil is arid.

490
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,760
So with he and his brother
we'll be dead by the time...

491
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
What if the dandelion
was in fertile soil?

492
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,240
What if we take the roots
from Matty,
and put them in Nick?

493
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,680
Turn the kid into
a petri dish, only better.

494
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,320
A petri dish can't
tell you when it hurts.

495
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,480
You want to give him
his brother's infection?

496
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,000
The very thing we've been
trying to avoid
since the brother sneezed?

497
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,440
Leukemia kid's
got no defenses.

498
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,880
Which is why he'll die.

499
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,800
But before he does,
the infection
will spread fast.

500
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,640
Fast enough to tell us
what it is, in time to
save his brother.

501
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,640
Do you see any other way?

502
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,560
WILSON: The infection
is decimating
Matty's bone marrow.

503
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,160
But if we give that marrow
to Nick, his symptoms
could let us diagnose Matty.

504
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
But, it'll kill Nick.
Yes.

505
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,520
You're...

506
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,000
You're saying we should
kill one son to
save the other?

507
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
Nick is gonna die either way.

508
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,680
You don't know that.
I mean, he's in pain
right now, but...

509
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,440
Nick's Graft-Versus-Host
is not responding
to medication.

510
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,240
That can change.

511
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,600
Maybe he... He'll rally.

512
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,400
Hey, my Nick is a fighter.

513
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,280
Graft-Versus-Host
isn't gonna go away

514
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,800
because of Nick's sunny smile
and positive outlook.

515
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,200
Nick has survived
three reoccurrences
of his leukemia.

516
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,480
He's being torn apart
from the inside out.

517
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,800
His pain's gonna get worse
and worse, until he dies.

518
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,960
You're just dragging it out.

519
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,800
You have only
one decision to make.

520
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,120
You can leave here
with one dead son, or two.

521
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,880
Tell them.

522
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
You should let us do this.

523
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,480
No!

524
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,160
We're not giving up on Nick.

525
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,800
Not!

526
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,640
The patient's parents
apparently don't want to be
parents anymore.

527
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,480
You're a sneaky bastard.
Any ideas how
we get around this?

528
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,960
Court order?
It's hardly sneaky.

529
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,640
We can still save Matty.

530
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,400
Run more tests,
find out what infection
is destroying his marrow.

531
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,760
Ten-thousand possible
infections at least
20 minutes per test

532
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,360
it'll take you
approximately eight years.

533
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,720
Actually, four months,
assuming the last one I test
is the right one,

534
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,240
and, if it's the first,
it will take me approximately
20 minutes.

535
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,880
He's right. It's worth a shot.

536
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,560
He's timid.
Testing blindly is not
gonna save this kid.

537
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,960
But standing around here will.

538
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,320
(NICK GROANING)

539
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,160
Wow, he sure is hurting.

540
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,080
The nurses say he maxed out
on his pain meds.

541
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,280
If I had a nickel for
every time I heard that...

542
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,080
Pharmacy's
on the ground floor.

543
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,080
I'm gonna go get you
some more pain medication,
okay?

544
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,600
Thank you.

545
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,960
It's not gonna help.

546
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,600
You're dying.

547
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,960
Nothing's gonna change that.
These drugs will just
make you go easier.

548
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,400
I know.

549
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,520
Fourteen years on the planet,
most of them spent suffering.

550
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,640
Dying before you even
got to drive a car,

551
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,480
take off a girl's bra,
drink a beer.

552
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,240
Believe me, there's plenty
you haven't done.

553
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,200
Really good stuff.

554
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,120
Must make it hard
to believe in God,

555
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,400
or fairness, larger purpose.

556
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,680
But your life
doesn't have to be
meaningless.

557
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,200
You can save your brother.

558
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,560
How?

559
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,000
FOREMAN: Negative for CMV.

560
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,520
WILSON: Negative for amoebas.

561
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,520
House called you timid.

562
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,160
He's called me a lot worse.

563
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,320
To him, there is
nothing worse.
He's gonna fire you.

564
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,040
Even if we run 100 tests,

565
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,520
that only gives us
a one percent chance
of saving these kids.

566
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,520
Better than zero.
You don't care
if you get fired?

567
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,560
I don't know.

568
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,520
There's got to be a way to
better our odds from
a 99-percent chance of death.

569
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,560
You've got to know.

570
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,040
It's not food-borne,
because no one else
in the family is sick.

571
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,680
You either care about
your job, or you don't.

572
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,120
And Matty's the only one
who drank from that water
pump in the back yard,

573
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,760
<i>and we eliminated Pseudomonas
and cholera.</i>

574
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,960
If you care,
you fight to keep it.
If you don't, you quit.

575
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,640
I thought they lived
in the suburbs.

576
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,120
They do. Why?

577
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,440
And they've got a water pump?

578
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,080
NICK: Please, I...
I want to do it.

579
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,760
No, Nicky,
it's not your decision.

580
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,680
I'm dying.
There's nothing that's
gonna change that.

581
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,480
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't say that. Okay?
You can't give up.

582
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,960
It's time for me to go, Dad.

583
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,240
You got to let me go.

584
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,560
No.

585
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,960
Please, son.

586
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,360
I can't... I can't...
I can't!

587
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,320
Let me do it for Matty.
Let me do it for you guys.

588
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,320
So you won't be alone.

589
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,080
Are you sure?

590
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,920
No, but he is.

591
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,400
Get Nick back
to the clean room.

592
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,040
The parents agreed
to infect him.

593
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,800
We figured out
what's wrong with Matty,
histoplasmosis.

594
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,680
Well, what is that?
I mean, why did it...

595
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,480
Fungal infection.
It grows in chicken feces.

596
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,440
The dirt that Matty used
to build his pitcher's mound

597
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,200
must have sat under
a chicken coop.

598
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,000
Your whole neighborhood
was built on top of farmland.

599
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,640
We didn't test for it earlier,
because we didn't...

600
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,880
Can you fix him?

601
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,080
Full course of amphotericin
and he should be fine.

602
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,400
And Nick?
I mean, can you clean
Matty's marrow?

603
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,360
Just like you were talking
about doing it, but do it
fast, and get it into Nick.

604
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,320
I'm sorry, the reason
Matty is so sick is

605
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,360
because the infection
is attacking his marrow.

606
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,920
He doesn't have enough left
to safely take from him
and give to his brother.

607
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,840
I'm gonna get better now?
That's it?

608
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,720
That's it.

609
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,120
And what about Nick?

610
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,960
Your brother was willing
to risk his life to save you.

611
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,440
Are you willing to
do that for him?

612
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,320
I can't sedate you.
You're too sick.

613
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,840
(SCREAMING)

614
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Please, please stop. Please.
Please. You're done, right?

615
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,040
Sorry, I need a lot more.

616
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,320
No, stop! Stop!

617
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,600
How much heat are you taking
from the parents?

618
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,760
They're calming down.

619
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,920
I think it has something to do
with both their kids being
alive, awake, and eating.

620
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,000
The marrow transplant took.

621
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Welcome back, Foreman.

622
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,520
You should talk to him.

623
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,080
Tell him how proud I am?

624
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,000
Hey, if you're ashamed of him,
tell him that.

625
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,520
Pride and shame only apply
to people we have a vested
interest in, not employees.

626
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
How many hours a day
do you have to spend
with someone

627
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,000
before they're
basically family?

628
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,160
Good point.

629
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,400
But, first, I've got to tell
Cameron and Chase that
they're violating God's will.

630
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,280
I'm just asking you to have
an adult conversation
to let him know...

631
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,800
That he did a good job?
He knows it.

632
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,680
Adults don't need adult
conversations, just like I
don't need this conversation.

633
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,680
Have you killed Hector yet?

634
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,960
Obviously not.

635
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,640
Oh. He's quiet. He's...

636
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Is that my stethoscope?

637
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,040
Bad dog.

638
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,800
Listen...

639
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,560
Bonnie joined her homeowner's
association and staged a coup.

640
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,680
Pets are now allowed.

641
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,920
Oh.

642
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,520
If you want to keep him,

643
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,120
she wants a new puppy anyway.
She'll understand.

644
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,040
Why would I want to keep him?

645
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,760
You're sure?

646
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,200
Come on, boy.

647
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280
Accidents happen.

648
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,600
Candy?

649
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,480
Good boy.

650
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,400
Good boy.

651
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,120
You did good.

652
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,240
I did what you would have.

653
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,000
Well, maybe I'm biased, but...

654
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,200
I tortured the kid.

655
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,440
Because you knew it was right.

656
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,560
You knew you were
saving his brother.

657
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,120
I know.

658
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,240
I don't like that I know.

659
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,160
I hate that I can listen
to a kid screaming in pain

660
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,000
and not even take a moment
to question whether I'm
doing the right thing.

661
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,760
I hate that in order
to be like you, as a doctor,

662
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,520
I have to be like you
as a human being.

663
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,280
I don't want to turn into you.

664
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,640
You're not.

665
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,080
You've been like me
since you were
eight-years-old.

666
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,920
You'll save more people
