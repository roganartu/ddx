(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,480
Jasper, hold still.
Stop squirming, hold still.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,840
What did he do now?

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,840
He got in another fight
and I can't get his nose
to stop bleeding.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,080
You have to apply
much more pressure than that.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,280
(COUGHS)

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,640
You had to do this today.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,320
I got office hours,
I'm supposed to have dinner
with the Dean.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,360
You just can't lash out
whenever you get angry.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,960
He said I smelled like
a monkey.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,760
Well, you do. You can't
refuse to take a bath

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,320
and then hit kids
who tell you
that you smell. Damn.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,880
Don't you think
we should call 911?

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,920
This isn't his first
nosebleed. He'll be fine.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,720
Daddy!
Hey! Lucy Goosey!

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,960
I'm playing doctor.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,880
So am I. Can you
go back and play?

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,760
(GROANS)

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,880
When was this fight?

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,480
Over ten minutes ago.

21
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,120
I feel dizzy.

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,360
Maybe you should
make that call.

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay.

24
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,440
Daddy, look, I can help.

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,160
No, no, that's great, honey.
Can you just please
leave Daddy alone?

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,280
TEACHER: One of my kids
is bleeding profusely
from the nose. Please hurry.

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,840
They're sending an ambulance.

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,360
(SIGHS)

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,920
Call them back. He'll be fine.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,880
How you feeling, bud?
You light-headed?

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,000
Lucy.

00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,280
(GASPING)

33
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,720
Lucy? Are you okay?
Lucy? Lucy?

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,440
Lucy? Lucy, are you okay?

36
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,320
Lucy! Lucy!

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,920
Oh, for God's sake.

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,040
Stop. Don't move.

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,440
The way the soft evening
light catches your eyes.

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
The gentle caress of dusk
on your hair

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,280
as you turn around
and leave my office
without giving me that file.

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,800
Restrictive pericarditis.

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,000
Boring.

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,040
She's in kindergarten.

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,960
Less boring. Or Grandma's
been held back a few years.

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,000
It's calcified
and she's hypertensive.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,160
Better get her into surgery.

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,800
She already is in surgery.

49
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,920
Tricky procedure.
It's gonna take all night.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,640
Sleep tight.

51
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,480
No congenital defects,
no health problems,

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,440
but her heart is
strangling itself.

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,840
Fascinating.
Since the pathology
on the pericardium

54
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,760
won't be back
until after they remove it.

55
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,800
Get started on her blood.
You can test for
viral infections, bacterial...

56
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,640
Round up the usual suspects.

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,880
Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis,
hemochromatosis.

58
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,080
Heck, go wild.
Do all the -osises.

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,600
All taken care of.
Sleep tight.

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,880
FOREMAN: This thing is already
all around her heart.

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,840
It gets into the muscle,
she's dead.

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,680
Best bet's Coxsackie virus,

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,880
Parvovirus B19, CMV.

64
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,080
Bacterial infection's
more likely to turn
constrictive. It could be TB.

65
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Right, forgot about the part
where she did
time in a Russian gulag.

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Her hematocrit's elevated.

67
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
A few extra red blood cells
means nothing.

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,120
She's probably
just dehydrated.

69
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,640
Yes, and I could assume
three or four things
to fit my theory, too.

70
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,520
She's sick!
She obviously hasn't
been drinking enough...

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,080
Enough!

72
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,720
I take it you two
aren't sleeping
together anymore?

73
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,720
We do what House said,
we test for everything.

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,160
Good, then I can go home.

75
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,360
Since when does
we not include you?

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,080
Well, House is gonna
call us idiots, anyway.

77
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,040
Might as well be
a well-rested idiot.

78
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,560
You guys are idiots.

79
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,120
Why? Because we stayed up
all night doing exactly
what you told us to do?

80
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,080
No, because you stayed up
all night doing exactly
what I told you to do

81
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
and have nothing
to show for it.

82
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,120
We eliminated dozens
of wrong answers.

83
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,880
I asked you what two plus two
equals and a day later
you tell me, "Not 25."

84
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,800
Pathology report
just got filed.

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,280
They found granulomas
in Lucy's pericardium.

86
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,080
Indicates a fungal infection.

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Nice work.

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,200
He went home.

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,800
Work smart, not hard.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,800
Find out which fungus.
Biopsy a lymph node.

91
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
Take employee of the month
with you.

92
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,760
I would rather Foreman...
I know.

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,040
I don't want any more shots.

94
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,760
I don't want any more shots.

95
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,680
Jasper.

96
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,640
Look at me, Goosey.
Squeeze my hand, okay?

97
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,600
This will tell us why
you're sick, so that
we can make you all better.

98
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
Where would she pick up
a fungus?

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,680
Anywhere moist. Around a pool,
locker room, public shower...

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,440
She doesn't have any gym
or swim classes.

101
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,600
She doesn't even like to play
with kids outside.

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,760
You haven't taken any trips?
Gone anywhere new?

103
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,880
It's been hard to get away
since their mom...

104
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,480
Our mom is dead.

105
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,960
I'm sorry.
Last year. Brain cancer.

106
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,720
You're gonna stick that thing
in her arm?

107
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,160
Cool!

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
The cool part is
your sister
won't feel a thing.

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
Nice necklace.

110
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,240
Thanks.
You like video games?

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,840
Love them.

112
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,640
That should do it. You okay?

113
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,600
I want my bunny.

114
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,240
Are you being silly?

115
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,480
I didn't know
which one to take.

116
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,200
What do you mean?

117
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,880
What's happening?

118
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,040
So. What does
the double vision tell us?

119
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,560
Slit lamp revealed
the eye's anterior chamber
is swollen.

120
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,200
Uveitis. Means it's not
a post-op effect
and it's not neurological.

121
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,240
It's not fungal, either.
Lymph node biopsy was clean.

122
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,480
So, we're back to square one.

123
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,800
One and a half.
We've eliminated
two more conditions.

124
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,480
Yes. Two plus two
doesn't equal 12 or 16,
either.

125
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,440
Vision issues plus
screwy heart equals
some type of autoimmune.

126
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,840
Lupus and Kawasaki's
are the most common
in a six-year-old.

127
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,480
Yeah, tough to find
a six-year-old who doesn't
have Lupus or Kawasaki's...

128
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
Did you look at her knees?

129
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
Those knobby things
in the middle of her legs.
Any scars or scabs?

130
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,280
What does that
have to do with...

131
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,960
Well, most six-year-olds
hurt themselves a lot.

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,680
Crash their bikes,
climb trees, bungee jump...

133
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,640
Dad says she doesn't like
to run around outside.

134
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,400
'Cause running around
outside hurts.

135
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,680
She didn't mention anything...

136
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,320
Most six-year-olds are
not familiar with the phrase,
"My joints feel inflamed."

137
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,840
So, two plus two equals...

138
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,760
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,200
We're checking her ANA
to confirm and giving her
steroids to fix her vision.

140
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,480
Some idiot gave me two tickets
for a play tonight.

141
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,880
Saved his life.
Apparently worth $186.

142
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
Sorry, had to take a leak.

143
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,600
Oh, I didn't know
you were seeing a patient.

144
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,760
It's an exam room.
What did you think
I was doing?

145
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,720
What you usually do.
Hiding from Cuddy.

146
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
Well, it'd be stupid
to do it in here.
There's a patient in here.

147
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,920
You been drinking more?

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,280
No, I haven't.

149
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,920
Guy's peeing all the time.
Play. Interested?

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,480
Sure. You want me
to pick you up?

151
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,680
Well, I'm not going.
You said two tickets.

152
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,600
You thought this was a date?

153
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Any other symptoms?

154
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,760
My stomach hurts.

155
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,200
I have back pain
and muscle aches,

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,880
I feel dizzy and I have
trouble concentrating
sometimes in class.

157
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,400
I really should...

158
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,760
You want the tickets or not?

159
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,480
Why don't you
want to go with me?
It's a play.

160
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,280
Dudes only go to plays
if they're dragged by women
they're hoping to see naked.

161
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,880
So, why are you
giving them to me?

162
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,320
Maybe there's someone
you wanna see naked.

163
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,560
(EXHALES)

164
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,680
All right.

165
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
(DOOR CLOSES)

166
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,200
Any fever?
No.

167
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,000
Anything in your pee
other than pee?

168
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,240
No.

169
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm going to need
a urine sample.

170
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,200
No!

171
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,920
Yeah, that last one
wasn't a question.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,680
You might have diabetes...
I can't pee in public.

173
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,560
We have bathrooms.

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,200
I can't pee
in public bathrooms.

175
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,800
Where can you pee?

176
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,600
I only live
a few miles from here.

177
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,840
I thought arthritis
was for old people.

178
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,560
JRA is an autoimmune disease.

179
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,160
Her body's attacking itself,

180
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,960
causing inflammation
in the joints,
her eyes, and her heart.

181
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,200
Is it treatable?

182
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,720
It can be crippling,
but it can also go into
complete remission.

183
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,880
Well, the good thing is
we caught it early.

184
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,520
Gives her the best chance
to have a positive outcome.

185
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Dad.

186
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,320
Don't get up, Goosey.

187
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,400
Your stitches.

(MUMBLING)

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,320
(GASPING)

190
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,680
She's having a stroke.

191
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,480
The stroke was caused
by a clot in her
middle cerebral artery.

192
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,640
Started her on tPA.

193
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,800
Should dissolve the clot
and hopefully
prevent brain damage,

194
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,360
but we won't know
for sure until she regains
consciousness.

195
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
Or she has another stroke.

196
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,240
Arthritis, heart disease.
Why can't this kid
act her age?

197
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,200
JRA doesn't affect the blood.
That means the clot's
a symptom of something else.

198
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,680
It's a symptom of
polycythemia.

199
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,720
She's fully hydrated
and her blood's still
thicker than pancake batter.

200
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,400
Well, thick blood
explains the stroke.

201
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,040
It could also have caused
an autoimmune response,

202
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,320
which would explain
the JRA kicking into gear.

203
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,640
But what explains
the thick blood?

204
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,240
Lack of oxygen forces the body
to overproduce red cells.

205
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,640
What explains
the lack of oxygen?

206
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,680
Carbon monoxide fumes,
cigarette smoke.

207
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,280
I doubt our patient's
a smoker.

208
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,240
Dad could be.
He's not.

209
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,040
He says he's not.
Hey!

210
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,400
Don't make me turn the hose
on you two.

211
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,560
Chase is right.

212
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,400
You two go check the house,
see if Dad's a closet
Marlboro Man.

213
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,760
You're intentionally
punishing us.

214
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,520
By making you do your job?
Does seem kind of cruel,
doesn't it?

215
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,680
Take along a carbon monoxide
detector to check for leaks,

216
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,200
and, you, start her
on hydroxyurea to control her
red blood cell production.

217
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,120
Dig out a Merck Manual,
Medieval edition.

218
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Tell you how to drain
a pint or two
so she doesn't clot again.

219
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,280
Dr. Cameron!

220
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,280
I got you flowers
for helping my sister.

221
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,720
That's so sweet.

222
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
Does your dad know
you're down here?

223
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,400
Yes.

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,200
"Congratulations
on your bundle of joy."

225
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,120
Something you forgot
to tell me?

226
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,480
You should take these back
to where you found them.

227
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,960
Okay.
Excuse me?

228
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,360
Can you make sure
these flowers

229
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
and this kid both get back
to where they belong?

230
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,040
Sure.

231
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,760
Thanks.
Let's go. Come on.

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,440
Wait.

233
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,280
DERAN: So, you're just
draining blood from her?

234
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,960
You're not testing it?
You're not fixing it?

235
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,920
Your daughter's
vascular system is
engorged with blood.

236
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,840
Draining some reduces
the chances of another stroke.

237
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,080
We're also starting her
on a drug that suppresses
the production of red cells

238
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,440
so we don't have to
keep doing this.

239
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,840
Good chance
she'll make a full recovery.

240
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,400
She hasn't spoken yet.

241
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,440
Give her time.

242
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,280
This your boy?

243
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,080
Where have you been?
Exploring. See ya.

244
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,600
Thank you.

245
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,840
You know you can't just
run off without telling me.

246
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,400

Why did you take the flower?

253
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,440
Why did you kiss him?
He did something sweet.

254
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,880
He stole flowers.

255
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,240
He's eight.

256
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,560
You're trying to
make me jealous.

257
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,320
Yeah, I want you to
profess your love for me.
Oh, wait.

258
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,080
You already did that
and it caused me
to end our relationship.

259
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,840
You're enabling a thief
and a delinquent!

260
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,440
Letters from school.
Fights, detentions,
a parent conference...

Oh, I know, I know.
Bad boys, hard to resist.

262
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
It's a crush. It's harmless.

263
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,600
It's never harmless.
So I'm learning.

265
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,640

We snipe at each other?

266
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm not sniping,
I'm looking for a vent.

267

the garage. There's all sorts
of CO sources down there.

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
I found a vent.

equal abuse.

Hectic job,

283

his wife passed away
last year, he could easily
be taking it out on the kids.

284
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,560
Or she had a nosebleed
and grabbed a t-shirt.

285

She's so ashamed of
a nosebleed

286
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
she has to hide the evidence
in a vent under her bed?

287
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,320
She's socially isolated,
the brother's always in
trouble, it's classic signs.

288
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,600
But no physical signs.

289
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,960
No marks on her body,
no bruises at all.

290
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,160
What if it's sexual?

291
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,320
We should call
Social Services.

292
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,800
Well, this sucks.

293
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,080
Either it's abuse,
or it's not abuse,

294
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,400
which means either
it's a symptom or it's
completely irrelevant.

295
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,960
Either way,
we got to waste half a day
figuring out which.

296
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,120
Full physical exam.

297
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,000
Look for bruises we may have
missed, check her mouth
and do a vaginal exam.

298
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,480
We can't do a vaginal exam
on a six-year-old without
the dad's consent.

299
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,240
And if he's abusing her,
he'll never say yes.

300
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,040
"Never" is just "reven"
spelled backwards.

301
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,560
Have you been abusing
your daughter?

302
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,840
What? Why would you...

303
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,560
We found this
hidden in a vent
under her bed.

304
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,840
I don't know
anything about this.
Maybe she had a bloody nose?

305

We need to examine her
for abuse.

306
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,840
You can't really think I...
Maybe you,
maybe the school bully

307
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,960
maybe the creepy neighbor.

308
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,680
I'm guessing you're not
paying as much attention
as you should be.

309
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,280
Do you even know
where your son is right now?

310
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,160
Yeah, he was here just...
Here a minute ago.

311
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,200
She isn't being abused.

312
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,440
Unfortunately, that answer
doesn't help me.

313
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,560
If you have abused her,

314
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,800
you're obviously
gonna lie about it.
I'm not lying!

315
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,560
We need to do a vaginal exam.
No.

316
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
She may be dying,

317
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,720
she still can't talk
and you're gonna waste
your time with this?

318
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,400
Either you consent and
we waste a few hours doing
the exam, or you refuse

319
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,160
and I call Social Services
and they waste three days
doing an investigation

320
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,960
which ends with them
doing the exam anyway.

Okay. I'm gonna look inside
your mouth. Open wide.

I need to look at your chest
and your back next, okay?

323
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,680
I know you can't talk,
so stop me if you get scared.

324
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,000
Before you came here,
did anyone hurt you?
Make you bleed?

325
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,360
I need to look
in your vagina now.
Do you understand?

326
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm a doctor, so it's okay.
All right?

327
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,320
Bend your knees,
keep your ankles together

328
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,080
and just let your knees fall
to the side, okay?

329
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,080
Oh, my God.

330
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,640
She has cuts
all over her genital area,
like slices.

331
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,520
Some are almost healed,
but some are new.

332
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,960
She could be doing it
to herself.

333
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,440
She's a little young
to be cutting.

334
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,400
She's a little young
for a stroke.

335
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
Depression accounts for
the cuts, molestation accounts
for the depression.

336
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,040
But do the cuts
account for all that blood?
They weren't deep enough.

337
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,640
So she's getting cut,
but that's not
the source of the blood?

338
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,960
The other obvious source
is forcible penetration.

339
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,600
The obvious source
of the blood, not the cuts.

340
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,760
There was no tearing,
there's no evidence at all.

341
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,000
So we have no explanation
for the cuts or the blood.

342
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,720
Where is he?

343
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,240
What if our original
assumption was wrong?

344
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,360
Meaning what?

345
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,480
We found a t-shirt
covered with blood hidden
in a heating vent.

346
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,920
How do we know it's even hers?

347
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,240
Her dad identified it.

348
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,640
Not the shirt, the blood.

349
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,400
Are those
the urine test results?

350
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,080
Yes.
And...

351
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,480
I'm going to ask you
for some blood.
Why?

352
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,960
To see if your answer will be,
"I can't bleed in public."

353
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,280
This wasn't your urine,
was it?

354
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,920
Why would I give you
someone else's urine?

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,320
The usual reason is
because you're on steroids.

356
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,600
I'm not an athlete.

357
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,120
Second favorite reason is
because you're on drugs.

358
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,680
I'm not.
I am.

359
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,040
Third favorite reason is
you have insurance but your
friend Eggs Benedict doesn't.

360
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,840
So, Eggs describes a list of
symptoms and you repeat them
to a doctor,

361
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,120
which is particularly stupid
because this is a free clinic.

362
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,040
Need you, now.

363
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,880
My work here is done.

364
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,120
Am I okay?

365
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,640
Is it diabetes?

366
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,400
No, you're pregnant.

367
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,040
Six-year-old abuse victim
and you haven't called
Social Services?

368
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,440
She might've been abused?
That's horrifying.

369
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,200
Why are you wearing
extra concealer
under your eyes?

370
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,360
The law's clear.
You suspect abuse,
you call the authorities.

371
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,880
You don't proceed as usual
while the possible abuser
sits by her bedside.

372
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,160
Dad consented to the exam
which means it's not the dad.

373
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,520
How late were you
out last night?

374
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,400
It's always the dad
and I don't have a curfew.

375
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,000
Panty hamster
get a spin on its wheel?

376
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,280
I went to a play.

377
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,920
House, you are going back
to your office.
You are picking up your phone,

378
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
calling Social Services
and you are reporting
suspected abuse.

379
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
Do you understand?

380
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,040
What play?

381
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

382
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,400
You're trying to have sex
with Cuddy.

383
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Fries?
You took her to a play.

384
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,000
You only take women
to plays because...

385
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,120
No, you only take women
to plays for that reason.
That's your theory.

386
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,080
Okay. Then why did you
take her to a play?
She's a friend.

387
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,560
A friend with a squish mitten.

388
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,240
It is possible to have
a friend of the opposite sex
without...

389
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,760
Blasphemer!

390
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,640
She's not a friend
of the opposite sex,
she's a different species.

391
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
She's an administrator.

392
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
She's going to eat your head
after she's done.

393
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,360
Yes, I slept with her.

394
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,480
Seriously?
No.

395
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,680
Yes, you did.

396
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,200
Yes, I did.

397
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
Seriously?
No.

398
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,800
You've got a problem, House.

399
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,240
We just tested the blood
on Lucy's t-shirt,

400
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,480
it's full of
endometrial cells.

401
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,400
So it's not her blood.

402
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,280
We tested that, too. It is.

403
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,560
Your six-year-old patient?

404
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,440
It's menstrual blood.

405
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,440
She's started puberty.

406
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,240
How can someone start puberty
before they even start
the first grade?

407
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,960
She was in diapers
two years ago.

408
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,400
For some reason her body
has too much sex hormone.

409
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,080
It caused her
reproductive system
to get confused,

410
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,080
start operating prematurely.

411
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,080
We need to find out
the source of the hormones
and cut it off.

412
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,600
She's so young.

413
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,960
I haven't even

414
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,800
talked to her about sex.

415
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,880
I doubt she even knows
what a period is.

416
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,320
Girls talk to their moms
about that.

417
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,800
You're gonna be okay, Goosey.

418
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,000
I love you.

419
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,240
I

420
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,840
want

421
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,800
juice.

422
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,920
(GASPS)

423
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,400
She got her period
and didn't know what it was.

424
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,800
She was scared and confused.

425
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,240
A friend told her
to put a t-shirt
in her underwear.

426
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,760
When she started
growing pubic hair,

427
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,240
she snuck Daddy's razor
and tried to shave it off.

428
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,600
Apparently forgot to sneak
the shaving cream.

429
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
Tumor's most likely.

430
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,600
A pituitary adenoma
would send her
hormone level sky-high.

431
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,400
In Puerto Rico, in the '70s,
there was an epidemic
of kids growing breasts

432
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,320
because of estrogen
in the poultry.

433
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,240
If it was in the food,
it would be an epidemic.
We've got one kid.

434
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,480
She's six, she's tiny,
she lives on chicken fingers
and milk.

435
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,040
Dad doesn't look like
the type to read labels,

436
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,800
he's probably buying stuff
packed full of hormones.

437
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,200
Excellent argument.
It's a tumor.

438
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,080
There's all sorts of
environmental sources.
Pesticides, soy products.

439
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,120
Some shampoos
are basically a placenta
in a bottle.

440
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,320
If the tumor's not
in her brain, it's in her
reproductive tract.

441
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,880
Get an MRI.

442
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
Can I at least...
Waste your time?

443
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,200
Wouldn't recognize you
if you didn't.

444
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,320
Frontal cortex is clean,
moving caudally.

445
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,200
For the record,
Cameron's the one
who broke it off.

446
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,720
Not interested.

447
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,760
No masses in the hypothalamus.

448
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
I wanted more.

449
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,400
She didn't share my feelings.

450
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,000
I feel like
I'm in a similar position.

451
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,600
Pituitary's clean.

452
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,680
You're an idiot.

453
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,440
Either she's lying
or she's actually
emotionally detached.

454
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,480
Which one sounds more
like Cameron to you?

455
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,880
Neither.

456
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,840
You have to choose one.

457
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,920
FOREMAN: There's a bright spot
on her left ovary.

458
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,480
Looks like a solid tumor.

459
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,920
They printed my letter.

460
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800

461
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,280
You were right.

462
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,520
Of course I was.
What are we talking about?

463
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,280
They printed my letter.
Great.

464
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,440
Cuddy.

465
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,760
You want to see her naked?
No, no, no.

466
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,280
She wants to see me naked.

467
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,400
She sent me flowers.

468
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,080
Just thanking you
for the play.

469
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,880
See, some people feel
an emotion called gratitude.

470
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,600
There's a card.
I suspected.

471
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,840
It explains how you knew
who they were from.

472
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,160
"Let's do it again.
Soon. XX, Lisa."

473
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,400
Xs are the kisses, right?

474
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,880
No, I think they're the hugs.

475
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,040
I think Os are the kisses.

476
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,520
No, no. The Xs are
definitely the kisses.

477
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,360
"Soon" is its own sentence.

478
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,760
I gotta go!

479
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,280
I'll miss you.
You were a good friend.

480
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,320
They printed my letter.

481
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,720
How was the play,
Mrs. Lincoln?

482
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,120
What's up with Wilson?

483
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,240
He's just a little freaked.

484
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,480
Why?

485
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,760
I sent him flowers.

486
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,800
Jasper, you're not
supposed to be up here.

487
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,320
Is that other doctor
your boyfriend?

488
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
No.

489
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,960
Your dad's probably looking
for you. He's got enough to
worry about right now.

490
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
Do you like him?

491
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,560
He's a friend.

492
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,560
Do you like him, like him?

493
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
We should get you
back to your dad.

494
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,840
Let me put this down
and I'll take you there.

495
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,280
I could be your boyfriend.

496
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,320
I think that wouldn't be fair
to the girls your own age.

497
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,160
He seems like a tool.

498
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,440
He's not. And that's rude.

499
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,360
I'm taking you back
to your father.

00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,240

No.

00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,040

Clear.

510
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,240
Arrhythmia must have been
a reaction to the hydroxyurea.

We have to stop
the drug therapy.

just go back to

515
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,320
We resect the tumor,
hormone levels go back to
normal, her symptoms go away.

516
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,800
Great plan, except for
the fact that her tumor's
not a tumor.

517
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,520
It's a benign cyst.

that just leaves
an environmental source.

What?

The answer's right there.
It's just a question of
finding it.

I shouldn't have
encouraged him.

Well, I was a boy once.
I know how they think.

You didn't.

no hormone secreting tumors.

Brother and sister get
the same type of tumor

or they both play
in the same toxic sandbox?

Well, anyone else think it's
more than a coincidence

00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,240
these kids have symptoms
that could be caused by
a brain tumor

592
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,880
which is exactly
what killed their mom?

there were no tumors.

So did their mom's,
until it didn't.

597
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,200
It can't be genetic.
Mom had none
of the same symptoms.

598
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,120
Yes, she did, if the symptoms
were pubic hair
and menstruation.

599
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,440
That's ridiculous.
If menstruation is
a symptom of brain cancer

600

then I should be
on chemo right now.

That's ridiculous. You're way
too skinny to be menstruating.

had other problems?

Symptoms her doctors ignored
on account of the fact
she was already dying?

Pull all her medical records.

to our patients.

behavioral issues...

612

They could be a function
of the increased testosterone.

Stomach pain is from

I found two more in her
kidneys and one in her lung.

623
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,040
They weren't there
48 hours ago.

Hormones are making
her body go haywire.

She gets one in her brain
or heart, she's dead.

626
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,440
No pressure, though.

627
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,880
Her mom was perfectly healthy
until she got cancer.

628
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,480
She had none of the symptoms
the kids have.

629
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,320
It's not genetic,
it's not environmental.

630
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,040
It's gotta be
a pituitary adenoma.

631
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,960
Yes! That would make
complete sense
if they had one.

632
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,600
Just because we haven't found
anything on the scan
doesn't mean it's not there.

633
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,360
We should remove
her pituitary gland.

634
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,400
Two siblings, same condition.

635
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,920
It's gotta be genetic
or environmental.

636
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,400
We add in the same time
and we're back to
just environmental.

637
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,400
Yes, and that would make
complete sense if there was
anything in her environment.

638
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,960
Just because we haven't
found anything yet...

639
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,600
She's been out of her
environment for four days
and she's still getting worse.

640
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,120
I'm getting
the father's consent.

641
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,600
No!

642
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,000
We have no evidence.

643
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,600
This is your process, House.

644
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,640
You asked us
what two plus two is.

645
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,080
We've eliminated every number
except for four.

646
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,920
She needs brain surgery.

647
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,120
The ovaries produce
sex hormones

648
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,600
in response to a signal
from the pituitary gland.

649
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,600
Since we know
the ovaries are fine,
the most likely cause...

650
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,040
"Most likely" means she
wants to root around inside
your little girl's brain

651
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,800
without any guarantee
that it'll work.

652
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,760
That's why she's holding off
on doing your son.

00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,680
Dr. House knows that
unfortunately we've ruled out
every other option.

656
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,840
They don't have
any family in town.

661
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,480
They go to after-school
daycare but none
of the other kids are sick.

662
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,680
Yet.

663
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,240
It took your son twice as long
to develop symptoms
as your daughter.

664
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,640
Maybe the other kids
are just slow.

665
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,360
We wait
and your daughter may die.

666
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,720
She does this,
your daughter will need

667
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
hormone replacement therapy
for the rest of her life.

668
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,360
The treatments are extremely
effective. She should lead
a relatively normal life.

669
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,120
And isn't that
every parent's dream?

670
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,520
To have a kid grow up to be
relatively normal?

671
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,400
My husband died of
thyroid cancer that
metastasized to his brain.

672
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,840
I've been there.

673

I know how terrifying
this can be.

And I am telling you
this is your best chance
to save your daughter's life.

You did not just play
the dead husband card.

My wife died.

677
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,120
Because she signed
a consent form that
I didn't want her to sign.

How did you know?

681
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,040
Know what?

682
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,080
That the other kids
weren't sick?

683
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,440
You've been here
for four days.

684
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,920
I just...

685
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,160
I would have heard.

686
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,080
Right.

687
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,560
Do you have hair
on your special place?

688
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,280
Miss Janie!

689
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,360
Can I help you?

690
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm a doctor.

691
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,800
Two of your kids are sick
and I need to know why.

692
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,920
You think they got sick here?

693
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,240
I think
you're dating their dad.

694
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,400
He told you?

695
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
No.

696
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,480
And I don't really care
why he didn't.

697
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,040
I just need to know
how often you go to their
house and what you bring.

698
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,280
I don't.
Shampoos, fancy soaps...

699
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,840
Kids get in your bag.
I've never been
to their house.

700
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,240
They just lost their mom
and we thought
it was too soon.

701
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,440
Why are you staring at me?

702
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Lip wax?

703
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,600
I just had it done over lunch.

704
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,440
Mani-pedi?
No.

705
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,400
Just the wax.

706
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,440
Women get a wax
as a part of a whole
self-indulgent beauty ritual.

707
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,360
Pedicures, steam,
cucumber masks.

708
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,120
No one runs out at lunch
just to get a lip wax,

709
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,000
unless you woke up looking
like Yosemite Sam.

710
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,760
You're an ass.

<i>Cameron.
It's always the dad.</i>

712
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,600
Excess facial hair in women.
It's a clear sign of
hormonal imbalance.

713
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
Exactly what
the little kiddies have.

714
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,720
Is there something wrong
at the daycare center?

715
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,720
There's something wrong
in your pants.

717
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,800
She's a lot younger
than I am. I

718
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,920
use a

719
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,800
male enhancement cream
to keep up with her.

720
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,040
What does this
have to do with...

721
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,480
Never occurred to you
to get a prescription

722
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,400
instead of some penis-pumper
loaded with testosterone?

723
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,800
I keep it at the gym.

724
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,360
I apply it daily in the shower
just like it says
on the bottle.

725
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,160
It's never been in my home,
it's obviously never been
near the kids.

726
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,160
But you have.

727
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,280
We've been through that,
I'm not a pervert
or a pedophile!

728
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,800
Thirty percent of our waste
is excreted through our skin.

729
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,760
That sounds high.

It's why you stink
after eating garlic.

Jack waters his beanstalk
every day for a week

732
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,040
he's oozing bean curd
out of his pores for a month.

733
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,840
Every time you gave the little
tykes a hug you gave them
a dose of testosterone.

734
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,680
Small for you, but more than
their little bodies
can handle.

735
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,600
So...

736
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,120
I did this to them?

737
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,320
Just holding their hands?

738
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,760
Uh-huh.

739
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,480
If I stop using it?

740
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,040
You'll be floppy,
they'll be fine.

741
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,360

Yeah, I think so.

Talk to Cuddy?
No, not yet.

748
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,840
I don't know what to say.

749
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,320
Just be straight with her.

750
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,520
I'm not sure what that is.

751
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,400
I can't stop
thinking about her.

752
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,560
In what way?

753
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,480
Maybe she's right. Maybe...

754
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,760
Maybe this is worth exploring.

755
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,440
Are you sure that she feels...

756
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
She sent me flowers.

757
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,680
How do I do this?

758
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
What do I say?

759
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,200
Cameron would tell you
to say how you feel.

760
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,080
Me? I'd get her drunk.

761
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,360
I'm not gonna say anything.

762
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,560
I'm just gonna
walk into her office
and I'm gonna kiss her.

763
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,600
That's a bold move.

764
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,120
Cuddy likes bold.

765
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,560
Yeah, you're right,
if you spoke, you'd just
say something stupid.

766
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,960
Yeah, I mean I'll either
get a girlfriend or get fired.

767
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,760
Okay.

768
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,360
Yeah. Okay.

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,560

a compelling argument.

took her to a play.

Well, why can't it be

May is when

If that guy wasn't trying
so hard to keep up
with a woman half his age,
