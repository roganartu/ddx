1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,836
Adam, eyes here.

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,421
(SHOUTS)

3
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:07,505
Follow my finger.

4
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:12,592
Adam, show me a bicycle.

5
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:19,721
Eyes here.

6
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:29,019
Adam, show me a bicycle.

7
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,488
No, buddy, that's a ball.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,115
Adam, look at me.
Are you hungry?

9
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:51,825
Show me what you
want for lunch.

10
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:13,046
He's still drawing those lines
instead of
looking at the cards.

11
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:17,341
More juice?

12
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:20,885
If he wants more juice,
he has to ask for it.

13
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:24,428
Adam, buddy, eyes here.

14
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:25,637
He's tired, Dom.

15
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:28,181
He wouldn't be
if we stuck to the schedule.

16
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:31,808
Show me the juice, buddy.

17
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,392
I think we've reached
the point of
diminishing returns.

18
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:35,644
He has to ask for it. Adam.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,979
He's choking.

20
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:42,356
That's impossible.
It's mac and cheese.

21
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,674
Ten-year-old boy who screams
for his life for no reason.

22
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:26,259
He's autistic.
Severely autistic.

23
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:29,219
Can't talk,
can't make eye contact.

24
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:31,429
Screaming is probably his way
of communicating.

25
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:34,305
And he went to
three different doctors
who all said just that.

26
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,598
So, clearly that can't be
the answer.

27
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:38,141
His brain can't
filter information.

28
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,560
It's a constant assault
on his senses.
I'd scream, too.

29
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:45,020
Or it's something
medical-sounding,
like dysesthesia.

30
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:49,148
Parents are convinced
that there's something wrong
with their son.

31
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:53,901
Since when did we start
believing parents? Or anyone?
Where are we going?

32
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:55,319
Elevator.

33
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,904
Dad was on Wall Street,
Mom was a partner
in an accounting firm.

34
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:01,030
When their son was diagnosed
with autism, they both quit.

35
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:03,907
So they're over-protective
and scared. That's all
the more reason to discount...

36
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:05,158
They study this kid.

37
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:08,368
Heard him scream a million
times, but in ten years
of caring for him,

38
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:09,994
this is the first time
they've brought him
to a hospital.

39
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:12,413
ER checked his throat.
No obstructions, nothing.

40
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:13,872
Which means the only symptom
was a scream,

41
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:15,373
which is diagnostic
of nothing.

42
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:18,458
Kid clutched his chest,
BP was elevated,
maybe there was chest pain.

43
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,418
ER said the heart was fine.

44
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,960
Don't be so quick
to dismiss pain.

45
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:24,087
Where are we going?
Down.

46
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,046
Stool sample
to check for parasites,

47
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,923
blood culture to
rule out infection,
and ANA for lupus.

48
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,340
Because he screamed?

49
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:32,300
Could also be
an environmental reaction.

50
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,802
An allergy.
Dust, wheat, pollen,

51
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,928
a toxin or something he ate.
Check the house.

52
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:38,762
And run a lung
ventilation scan.

53
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:40,180
Lungs are in the chest,
too, right?

54
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:41,597
I had a date last night,
she screamed.

55
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,349
Should we spend
a hundred thousand dollars
testing her?

56
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,100
Of course not.
This isn't a
veterinary hospital.

57
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,935
Look, if you don't think
this kid is worth saving...

58
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:50,186
That's not what I'm saying.

59
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,729
That's too bad.
It was a good point.

60
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:53,605
Kid's just a lump
with tonsils.

61
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:54,731
You know what it's
going to be like

62
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:57,191
trying to put an autistic kid
into a nuclear scanner?

63
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:59,025
I don't envy you guys.

64
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:04,862
I want my old carpet back.

65
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:10,532
We're going to have to
do this later. A kid
in the clinic had an accident.

66
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,075
Generally, when people
are on the phone...

67
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,743
I want my old carpet back.

68
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:16,077
It was stained with blood.

69
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:18,579
Yeah, my blood,
which makes the carpet
part of me.

70
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:20,747
I want it back.
I want to be buried with it.

71
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,873
You think you can get me to do
anything you want,

72
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:24,791
regardless of
how stupid it is?

73
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:26,834
It's my office.
It's where I work,

74
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:30,920
where I think, where
I save lives, allowing you
to brag to rich people,

75
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:34,297
so they'll give you more money
to spend on MRls
and low-cut tops.

76
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,090
I want it back the way it was.

77
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,550
It's identical
to the old carpet.

78
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,968
Except without
the hazardous
biological waste.

79
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:45,221
I shall not return to my
office until every patented,
durable micro-fiber

80
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:46,972
has been restored
to its rightful place.

81
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:48,264
Inspiring.

82
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,183
If you don't want to
work in your office,
work in the clinic.

83
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:54,601
If you don't want to work
in the clinic, go home.
And don't get paid.

84
00:04:54,685 --> 00:05:00,063
Attica! Attica!
Attica! Attica! Attica!

85
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,066
Attica?

86
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:10,320
He just needs to
finish this level.

87
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:12,404
We only have the scanner
for the next half hour.

88
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,947
After that...
Trust me,

89
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,490
you don't want to move him
until he's finished.

90
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:20,368
The sooner we do this test,
the sooner we can
get you guys home.

91
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,247
Adam, do you think that...

92
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:30,749
No.

93
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,460
Ten minutes. Tops.

94
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,128
If he has a vascular disorder,
he might not have...

95
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,338
He might not have ten minutes?

96
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:41,881
I don't have ten minutes.

97
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:46,175
No! No! You don't want to
do that. Adam? Adam?

98
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,760
(SCREAMING)

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,221
I used Metamucil
like the doctor told me

100
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,931
and finally I was able to
use the bathroom.

101
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,185
But I saw something
in the toilet
I couldn't identify.

102
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:05,562
I wrapped it in tissue paper,
so you could take a look.

103
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:11,858
Can't you sedate him
or something?

104
00:06:11,941 --> 00:06:15,485
I could if I didn't want
the test results
to mean anything.

105
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:31,620
Painkillers, exercising,

106
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:35,081
we even did that
puncture thing, nothing works.

107
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,833
Then this morning, I get up,
my back feels great.

108
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:42,502
I figured I'd better
get down here, right away.

109
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:54,343
Big shocker, Dad's depressed.

110
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:55,469
Save your time.

111
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,720
SSRls don't cause chest pain.

112
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:01,389
Wow.

113
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,474
Every minute of every day
is booked.

114
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,975
When he eats, sleeps,
plays his handheld.

115
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,018
Not much of a life for them.

116
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,144
They chose to have a family.

117
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:12,604
You don't get to decide
what your kid's
going to be like.

118
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,397
Nobody chooses this.

119
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:22,194
It's funny,
you get a normal kid,
the parent works.

120
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:24,028
You get a special kid
that costs more,

121
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,863
you quit and turn the backyard
into a therapy circuit.

122
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,323
Yes, if only you
were handicapped.

123
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,450
All the good times
you could have had with Dad.

124
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,252
Hi, Doctor House.

125
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:51,504
Hello, girl whose name
I don't remember,

126
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:54,339
but whose dad I treated,
so I don't really know
why she's here.

127
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:59,550
Ali. I think I caught
what my dad has.
The rhino thing.

128
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:01,218
Right.

129
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:04,762
Does that hurt?

130
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:05,929
Little.

131
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:08,764
It's in my chest, too.

132
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:10,099
Of course it is.

133
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:22,898
Kind of had access
through the shirt,
but this'll work.

134
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:28,652
That feels good.

135
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,531
Exactly when did New Jersey
run out of horny
17-year-old boys?

136
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:38,450
About five weeks ago.
It's been very lonely.

137
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,496
The...

138
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,999
The ventilation scan
was normal.
Time to send him home.

139
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,542
Can't leave right now.
Well, congratulations.

140
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:56,086
You are the proud owner
of your very own
"rhino thing."

141
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,754
A rhinovirus?
You can't leave because
she has a cold?

142
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:01,631
I can't leave because
Cuddy says I can't leave.

143
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:06,342
All the tests are normal.

144
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:10,011
Okay, don't start with me.
We're backed up.

145
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,888
I know this is hard
for all of us,
but thanks to Doctor Cuddy,

146
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:14,806
I don't have an office,
so I have to work here.

147
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,348
What did she do
to your office?

148
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,849
It's unusable.

149
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,351
So whatever's bothering him,
it wasn't his lungs.

150
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,477
What about the kid's house?

151
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,312
There were some pesticides
and some alcohol, but
the tox screen was negative.

152
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:26,521
Which means there's nothing
physically wrong
with this kid.

153
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:29,273
We already had
that discussion.
We get a fecal smear?

154
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:30,982
Should we do this
someplace else?

155
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,984
No, Cuddy says
I have to work here.

156
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:36,861
No, I said you can work
in your office,
or you had to work here.

157
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,488
And since I can't work
in my office...

158
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,406
Is this your master plan?

159
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:45,200
Disrupt hospital business
until I replace your carpet?

160
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,076
Devious. Saw it
in a James Bond movie.

161
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,703
Fecal smear! Talk to me.

162
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:51,245
Get out of here.

163
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,329
Put back my carpet?

164
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:53,788
No. Get out of here.

165
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:56,165
Fecal matter.
Is there a sample
we can look at?

166
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:58,792
The parents have a smear kit.
The kid is constipated.

167
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,668
Do what you want.
Not replacing your carpet.

168
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:05,296
Go up his rear
and get a smear.

169
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:08,839
Which reminds me,
I kind of feel like a bagel.

170
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:12,550
Carpets.

171
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:17,595
Need a stool sample.

172
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:22,973
We should probably wait
until he's finished
playing that level, huh?

173
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:25,141
I actually think
he's a bit better today.

174
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,892
He seems more like
his old self.

175
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,769
It's possible that
he was never sick.

176
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:31,145
I guess,
we could've overreacted.

177
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:41,360
Adam? Adam?
Adam? Adam?

178
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:50,074
So what makes fluid
fill the lining
of a kid's lungs?

179
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:52,909
Why are we in here?
Is this some sort of
power play?

180
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:53,951
Yeah.

181
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:57,745
So, you stuck your finger
in the kid and gave him
a pleural effusion?

182
00:10:57,828 --> 00:10:59,788
Have you ever considered
getting a manicure?

183
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,998
I took the stool sample
after his lungs failed.

184
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,707
Or do you really
have a problem
with the carpeting?

185
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,041
Change sets you off...

186
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,667
I said it was a power play.

187
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:09,461
If someone answers yes
to option A, you don't
move on to option B.

188
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,921
If there's a pleural effusion,
we have to rule out
heart failure.

189
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,214
Why now? Why a power play now?

190
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:15,673
I smelled weakness.

191
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:18,216
Get the kid an echocardiogram.

192
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,389
That's funny.
It says, "James Wilson."

193
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:29,848
That's a strange typo.

194
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:34,184
The fluid comes back
and exudates, get him on
broad spectrum antibiotics.

195
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,354
Thank you for coming.
No problem.

196
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:41,022
Thought you wouldn't mind
sharing offices for a while.

197
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:47,193
You share stories, feelings,
toys, you don't share offices.

198
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,569
That is so not Zen.

199
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:52,071
It was a gift.

200
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:53,863
Some doctors get those.

201
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,323
So, you want mornings
or afternoons?

202
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:58,908
You couldn't make
Cuddy miserable, so you're
going to make me miserable,

203
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:00,868
so I can make Cuddy miserable
on your behalf?

204
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,910
Yeah.

205
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:03,953
What makes you think
I can make her miserable?

206
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:05,496
'Cause you're
good at that stuff.

207
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,038
I'm nothing compared to you.

208
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:08,247
Is there anything
you'll throw out?

209
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,415
That's a gift from
an eleven-year-old
patient of mine.

210
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:13,542
She and I both knew it was
a piece of junk, and
that's what made her laugh.

211
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:16,127
So you gotta keep it
until she...

212
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,670
She already did.

213
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,550
(ADAM SCREAMING)

214
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:30,094
Adam, I need you to
stay still, buddy.

215
00:12:30,178 --> 00:12:32,388
It's okay. It's okay.
I got him.

216
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,015
There we go.

217
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,938
What? What is it?
Is his heart okay?

218
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:49,315
No.

219
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:57,737
Echo suggested
a conduction abnormality,
EKG confirmed it.

220
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,823
Still doesn't explain the
effusion. The pleural fluid
was an exudate.

221
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,741
We should be looking for
something that explains both
the heart and lung problems.

222
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,076
An infection, parasite,
cancer.

223
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,120
Microbiology showed
no organisms in the fluids,
so forget infection.

224
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,455
It's not a power play.

225
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:18,166
Doing a differential
in the clinic makes sense,
piss Cuddy off.

226
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,376
Same thing with
Wilson's office,
works indirectly.

227
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:23,044
But now we're in office space

228
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:25,671
because you don't want to be
in your own office.

229
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:28,006
Which means this has nothing
to do with Cuddy.

230
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,340
You really are obsessed
with your carpets.

231
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:32,925
Which means...
What are you doing here?

232
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,260
I have this room
booked from two to three.

233
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:37,512
Two, East Coast Time?

234
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:43,474
I thought you meant Pacific.
Which is stupid of me,
I guess.

235
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,684
What about parasites?

236
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,268
Stool sample's negative.

237
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,394
It's two o'clock.

238
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:53,438
Oh, well. We should go then.
That just leaves cancer.

239
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,064
Get a lung biopsy.

240
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,858
It took a half an hour
to get the mask
on the kid for the lung scan.

241
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,901
I'm sorry.
Was there somewhere
you needed to be?

242
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:07,155
House, can we talk?

243
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:13,784
Carpet?
Never.

244
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:14,952
Nothing to talk about.

245
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:18,954
Your girlfriend called
the clinic 15 times,
looking for you today.

246
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:20,705
Lot to discuss,
china patterns...

247
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:22,206
House. She's a stalker.

248
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,290
Right.

249
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:26,751
Couldn't be that she finds me
interesting, attractive,
has to be that she's insane.

250
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:29,669
She's called you 15 times.
Your mother's not
that interested in you.

251
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:31,795
Well maybe I'd be
better adjusted if she was.

252
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,922
I'm notifying security.
Is this about the carpet?

253
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,631
Do you think I'll back off
if you block all my fun?

254
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:37,132
You better not be having fun.

255
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:38,800
I'm having fun.
I'm not having sex.

256
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:40,468
She's dangerous.
She's not dangerous.

257
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:42,052
She's pretty.
She's pretty.

258
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:44,137
Men are stupid.
I'm with you so far.

259
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:46,054
I'm notifying security.

260
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:50,849
Give her a break.
She's not dangerous,
she's insightful.

261
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,101
You can't stop our love!

262
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,898
Hey, you got a minute?
Yeah.

263
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:03,690
We have a ten-year-old
with pleural effusion

264
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:05,900
and conduction abnormality,
but no heart failure.

265
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,443
Was there protein
in the pleural fluid?

266
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:09,402
Yeah. That's why
we're thinking cancer.

267
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:12,654
Non-Hodgkin's probably.
So we want to do
a lung biopsy.

268
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:16,240
Lung biopsies usually
come back negative, so biopsy
a lymph node under the arm.

269
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:18,616
That's probably something
an oncologist should do,
right?

270
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,576
There's nothing real tricky
to it. It's a biopsy.

271
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:23,453
Still, just to be safe.
You mind?

272
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:27,205
(SCREAMING)

273
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:35,544
For the love of God,
can't somebody
shut that kid up?

274
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:37,128
People are trying to
work around here.

275
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:38,879
Why don't you show him
a teddy bear or something?

276
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:40,172
Who are you?

277
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,839
Somebody you'll
never send a gift to.

278
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,341
This is Doctor House,
your son's doctor.

279
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:46,092
High test, please.

280
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:48,885
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

281
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:53,805
Out of Vicodin?

282
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:56,307
What are you doing?

283
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,017
Eating the red berries.

284
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:26,159
He trusted you.

285
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:30,453
No, that wasn't trust.
That was self-preservation.

286
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,454
No. That was huge.

287
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:34,872
It was like a conversation.

288
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,376
A monkey's afraid to eat
the red berries until he sees
another monkey eat 'em.

289
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,337
Monkey see, monkey do.
That's all it was.

290
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,006
Your kid's still just
as messed up
as when we admitted him.

291
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:52,925
(CRASHING)

292
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:03,098
That was sensitive.

293
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:04,724
You have pretty hair.

294
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,060
Hope is all those parents
have going for them.

295
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,854
No, hope is what's
making them miserable.

296
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:14,439
What they should do is
get a cocker spaniel.

297
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:16,857
A dog would look them
in the eye,

298
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,151
wag his tail when he's happy,
lick their face,
show them love.

299
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,444
Is it so wrong for them
to want to have
a normal child?

300
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:24,487
It's normal to
want to be normal.

301
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,738
Spoken like
a true Circle Queen.

302
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:30,657
See, skinny,
socially-privileged
white people

303
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:32,659
get to draw this
neat little circle.

304
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:35,410
Everyone inside
the circle is normal.

305
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:37,620
Everyone outside the circle
should be beaten,

306
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:41,372
broken and reset,
so they can be
brought into the circle.

307
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:45,416
Failing that, they should be
institutionalized,
or worse, pitied.

308
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,585
So, it's wrong to feel sorry
for this little boy?

309
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:48,835
Why would you feel sorry
for someone

310
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:51,504
who gets to opt out
of the inane courteous
formalities,

311
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,922
which are utterly meaningless,
insincere, and therefore,
degrading?

312
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:57,841
This kid doesn't have to
pretend to be interested
in your back pain,

313
00:17:57,883 --> 00:18:01,135
or your excretions,
or your grandma's itchy place.

314
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,636
Can you imagine
how liberating it would be

315
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:06,596
to live a life free of
all the mind-numbing
social niceties?

316
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:10,807
I don't pity this kid.
I envy him.

317
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:17,061
No cancer because
these aren't lymph cells.

318
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:19,313
Then what are they?

319
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:21,522
Liver cells.

320
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:32,154
Wow, liver cells
under his arm.

321
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,824
Wonder what he's got
where his liver's
supposed to be?

322
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:54,668
Anyone got a clue how
liver cells got
into the kid's armpit?

323
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,672
Make yourself at home.

324
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:04,841
<i>So, you think maybe
Gray's Anatomy
got it all wrong?</i>

325
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:07,384
Lymph system circulates fluid,
not organ cells.

326
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,636
Cancer cells break into
the lymphatic system
all the time.

327
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,137
But we're not talking
about cancer cells.

328
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,680
So what's the difference
between cancer cells
and liver cells?

329
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:15,848
Why can one
pass through walls,
but the other can't?

330
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,808
Cancer cells are damaged,
it lets them grow
into blood vessels,

331
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:18,933
go wherever they want.

332
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:20,226
So if the liver cells
are damaged...

333
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,435
The liver isn't damaged.
The tests were normal.

334
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,812
So if the liver cells
are damaged,

335
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:27,439
it's theoretically possible
they passed into
the lymphatic system.

336
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:30,482
Liver failure could also
explain pleural effusion,
even the heart issues.

337
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:31,775
The liver cells are fine.

338
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:34,151
He was immunized for
Hep A and B, and do you
really think this kid

339
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:36,903
is having unprotected sex,
or sharing needles?

340
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:40,530
Daddy does seem
the type to use a rubber.

341
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:44,991
So it's not viral.
That just leaves
a lot of booze-irrhosis.

342
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:48,869
Our 10-year-old boy does not
have a drinking problem,
or cirrhosis.

343
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:50,119
House, when we
echoed his heart,

344
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:51,745
we got a piece of his liver.
There was no scarring.

345
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,455
Cirrhosis explains
the symptoms,
heart problems, lungs...

346
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,874
Look up cirrhosis
in the dictionary,
it means scarring.

347
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:59,167
Parents aren't doing
or dosing this kid.

348
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,418
How would you know that?

349
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,711
The kid can't talk.
Why do you think
I took this case?

350
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:04,170
He's not going to give away
the ending.

351
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:05,629
They quit their jobs for him.

352
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:09,048
Yes, they are everything
you'd want in a parent.

353
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,050
Unfortunately,
their kid is nothing
you'd want.

354
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:14,676
When a baby is born,
it's perfect.

355
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,846
Little fingers, little toes,
plump, perfect, pink,

356
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:21,431
and brimming
with unbridled potential.

357
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:25,433
Then it's downhill.
Some hills
steeper than others.

358
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,976
Parents get off
on their kids'
accomplishments.

359
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,728
<i>Bend over and relax.</i>

360
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,103
Cute.

361
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:34,897
They'll annoy you
with trophy rooms
and report cards.

362
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,857
Hell, they'll even show you
a purple cow

363
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:39,942
and tell what a keen eye
for color their kid has.

364
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:49,573
But this kid,
he doesn't smile,

365
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,408
he doesn't hug them,
he doesn't laugh.

366
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,617
His parents get nothing

367
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,494
but the right to brag that
their kid picked orange juice
out of a lineup.

368
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:59,037
So you figure they slip
the kid a mickey
so they don't have to deal.

369
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:01,206
Do a biopsy
to confirm cirrhosis.

370
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,375
Don't try to pawn it off
on Wilson, he's going to be
busy with Cuddy.

371
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:13,380
My parents love me
unconditionally.
Get out of here.

372
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:19,342
Don't you think
the restraining order's
a little much?

373
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:21,885
He's not actually going to
have sex with
a 17-year-old patient.

374
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,469
I didn't think he was
going to ask me

375
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,929
to dig a bloodstained carpet
out of a dumpster, either.

376
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:28,389
It might be easier
in the long run.

377
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:33,434
Are we stopping here,
so House doesn't find us?

378
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:36,561
Unless you want to make out.

379
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:39,896
You want me to surrender
to House's coup?

380
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:45,233
No, no. You pro-actively
give him what he wants.

381
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:47,484
I defeat him
by surrendering to him.

382
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:50,486
He'll never see it coming.
Look, I'll pay for it myself.

383
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,529
What is it, a thousand bucks
to carpet a room?

384
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,280
Actually, it's 400.

385
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:55,740
Not doing it.

386
00:22:02,077 --> 00:22:03,494
Liver biopsy?

387
00:22:03,578 --> 00:22:04,620
They're doing it now.

388
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:05,871
How's it going?

389
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:07,122
Like a biopsy.

390
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:09,540
Needles, cells, screaming.

391
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,416
What did you find
in the stool sample?

392
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,626
You were too busy
bothering Cuddy.

393
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,544
But as discussed,
it was negative for parasites.

394
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:16,919
Can we get out of here?

395
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,087
I didn't ask
what you didn't find,

396
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,172
I asked what you did find
in the stool sample.

397
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,089
Stool

398
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:25,592
and traces of iron, zinc,
calcium carbonate.
Can we leave?

399
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:28,385
What's the matter?
You afraid of the man?

400
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:29,719
Yeah.

401
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:32,638
Too late.

402
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:36,015
Leave my stuff alone.

403
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:39,475
You have a meeting with
a Guggenheim in 15 minutes.
You're wearing that?

404
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:42,852
I'm going to count to three
and then I'm going to
fire you. One.

405
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,562
Calcium carbonate?
That's an anti-diarrheal,
right?

406
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:47,188
Two.
Think that's significant?

407
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:49,523
Think hard poops
is significant?

408
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:52,233
Two and a half.

409
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:55,110
Never threaten
unless you're ready
to deliver.

410
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:56,569
Makes you look weak.

411
00:22:56,653 --> 00:22:58,571
Thank God you don't
have children.

(PHONE RINGING)

413
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,032
Doctor Cuddy.

414
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,284
Take a message.

415
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:10,786
Your patient is being
rushed to cardiac ICU.

416
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:14,831
Wow. That's like the one thing
that would get me out of here.

417
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:18,249
I'm sorry,
you can't come in here.

418
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,792
What's going on?

419
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,376
One, two, three.

420
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:25,421
He's in V fib.

421
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,215
Charged.

422
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,591
CHASE: Clear.

423
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,217
Charging, clear.

424
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:37,762
Charging, clear.
Charging, clear.

425
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:52,938
He's stable for the moment.
First-degree
atrial ventricular block.

426
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,189
Okay, what else do we know?

427
00:23:55,231 --> 00:23:58,066
His liver's damaged.
Pleural effusion compromised
his lung function.

428
00:23:58,108 --> 00:24:00,484
Biopsy was negative
for cirrhosis.

429
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,569
Parents didn't
poison their son.

430
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:06,488
It's not his liver,
his heart, or his lungs.

431
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,198
It's the calcium carbonate
in his stool.

432
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,908
Kid was constipated.
Parents probably
just overdid it.

433
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,034
Or they didn't do it at all.

434
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:16,119
Calcium carbonate
is also what's in chalk.

435
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:17,411
FOREMAN: So he ate some chalk.

436
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:19,830
It isn't toxic,
it sure didn't cause
the pleural effusion.

437
00:24:19,913 --> 00:24:20,955
Forget the chalk.

438
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,290
You just said
it was about the chalk.

439
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,082
Yes, and then I said,
"Forget the chalk."

440
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,042
You must be very confused.
The kid's got pica.

441
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,544
You take him to a buffet,
he's going to eat the table.

442
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:30,711
Or lead paint.

443
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:33,171
Level of lead in the blood
was normal.
His tox screen was clean.

444
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:34,589
We're not looking
for typical poisons.

445
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,507
We're looking for anything
that he could
put in his mouth.

446
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,550
Matches, spiders, bricks.

447
00:24:38,591 --> 00:24:41,093
Pressure-treated wood
used to contain arsenic.

448
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:42,260
Even better.

449
00:24:42,385 --> 00:24:46,054
Hansel, get samples
of the Gingerbread House.
Bag everything.

450
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:55,936
Hey.

451
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,898
You could get into
a lot of trouble being here.

452
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,441
I wanted to see you.

453
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:05,775
Yeah, I got that.

454
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:10,695
So did everyone else.
They think you're a stalker.

455
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:13,780
One could argue those people
might be jealous
of your attention.

456
00:25:13,863 --> 00:25:16,282
Yes, I actually
made that argument.

457
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,034
You going home?
That's the plan.

458
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:24,245
In Iceland,
the age of consent is 14.

459
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:28,831
I'm surprised that tourism
isn't a bigger industry
up there.

460
00:25:29,248 --> 00:25:32,041
Today I'm jailbait,
but in 22 weeks,

461
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:35,627
anybody can do anything to me.

462
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:39,546
Will I be so different
in 22 weeks?

463
00:25:40,213 --> 00:25:42,756
Twenty-two weeks is enough
for an embryo to grow
arms and legs.

464
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,924
It's just a line.

465
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:48,385
An arbitrary line drawn
by a bunch of sad,
old men in robes.

466
00:25:48,468 --> 00:25:50,845
Yeah, who cares
what judges think?

467
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:57,140
I didn't think of you as a guy
who followed rules
just because they were rules.

468
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,311
You are over ten years
younger than me.

469
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:07,772
I said, "Over."

00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:14,693

473
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:17,111
Do you happen to know the way
to the Icelandic consulate?

474
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:20,864
This young woman,
a stranger to me,
was just asking directions.

475
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:24,032
Security was going to
call the police. I don't
want to do that to you.

476
00:26:24,074 --> 00:26:25,908
Go home.
She needed a ride.

477
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:29,202
She got here on her own,
she can get home on her own.

478
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:30,912
Now.

479
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:36,165
If I see you on
hospital grounds again,
I will call the police.

480
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:53,426
After that look,
I'm feeling a little frisky.
Looks like you're up.

481
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,469
I'm ovulating. Let's go.

482
00:26:56,886 --> 00:26:58,762
The frisky, it went away.

483
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:00,972
House, this isn't a game.

484
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:08,643
If I leave her alone,
can I have my carpet back?

485
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,853
No.

486
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:13,355
If I forget about
my carpet can I have her?

487
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:41,497
Jimsonweed.
I found a small patch of it
in his backyard.

488
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:45,208
Jimsonweed contains atropine,
poor man's acid.

Meeting here will do nothing
to upset Cuddy.

492
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,130
I'm not trying to upset Cuddy.

493
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,466
I'm trying to figure out
what's wrong with the patient.

I'm done.

495
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:00,676
Jimsonweed doesn't explain
the screaming.

You've obviously
never had a bad trip.

Kid's got heart issues.
The two don't mix.

503
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,896
We'd better make sure
that's what he's got.

504
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:21,856
Serum from the lab
in Patterson is
three days minimum.

505
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:24,066
He won't survive three days.

506
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:25,567
What time does he wake up?

507
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,942
7:35 a.m.

508
00:28:27,026 --> 00:28:29,194
Then what? Walk me through it.

509
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:32,071
7:40 to 7:50 he goes
to the toilet,
washes his face.

510
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:33,071
What does this matter?

511
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:34,280
I'm trying to prove
he ate the plant.

512
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:36,198
His schedule has nothing to do
with jimsonweed.

513
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:37,407
There are two possibilities.

514
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:41,076
Either the parents saw him
eat the plant or the kid
has unsupervised time,

515
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:43,286
and eats plants instead of
playing with blocks.

516
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:45,662
Even if you find 15 minutes
of free time outside,

517
00:28:45,746 --> 00:28:47,288
it doesn't mean he spent it
eating a bush.

518
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:51,041
So, what do we do? Nothing?
Wait for the kid to tell us?
What?

519
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:56,878
Where are you going?

520
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:58,045
To talk to him.

521
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:10,553
Ever see your son eat a bush?

522
00:29:10,678 --> 00:29:11,845
I haven't.

523
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:13,305
I've only ever seen him eat...

524
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:15,389
Adam, you ate something
at your house.

525
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:19,267
Something that made you sick.
I need you to show me
what you ate.

526
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:20,934
He can't answer you.

527
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:22,561
Neither can you.

528
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,229
This is your backyard.

529
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:30,232
You may know it
as Mel's Diner.
This is your sandbox.

530
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:34,485
Your jungle gym.
And under it is this.

531
00:29:36,903 --> 00:29:39,446
I need to know
if you ate this, Adam.

532
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,948
He doesn't know what you want.

533
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:45,950
Adam, you have to tell me
because if you don't,

534
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,370
game over. You'll be dead.

535
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:53,371
What the hell are you doing?

536
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:55,164
Show me what you ate.

537
00:29:55,498 --> 00:29:58,625
Adam, show me what you ate.

538
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:20,555
Adam?
Honey?

539
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:21,931
Adam!

540
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:34,939
Come on in,
brothers and sister,

541
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,774
welcome to
the house of the Lord!

542
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:39,108
House, come on. The Chapel?

543
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:42,986
We have been blessed
with the miracle
of a new symptom.

544
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:44,737
Brother, can you testify

545
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,156
as to why this poor child's
eyeball rolled back
into his head?

546
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:53,242
It's consistent with
jimsonweed poisoning,
ocular paralysis. I'm sorry.

547
00:30:53,326 --> 00:30:54,910
The wicked shall deceive ye

548
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:57,912
because they have turned
from the Lord and are idiots.

549
00:30:57,995 --> 00:31:00,372
His ocular muscle
didn't paralyze,
it pirouetted.

550
00:31:00,413 --> 00:31:02,998
MS?
It is easier for a wise man

551
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,250
to gain access to heaven...
Will you stop doing that?

552
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:06,584
Just say, "Not MS."

553
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,794
A stroke, bleed in the brain.

554
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:12,504
We'd be seeing other symptoms
besides a single eye
misalignment. Like a coma.

555
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:13,797
And you've already testified.

556
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,298
It's a tumor.

557
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:17,299
And all the imaging
just missed it?

558
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:18,883
It's a micro-tumor.

559
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:21,093
It started in his lung,
which caused
the pleural effusion.

560
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:24,011
Then it metastasized
to his liver, which made
it slough cells.

561
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:28,222
And then it went to his brain
behind the eye, which caused
it to roll back into his head.

562
00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:31,391
So, he had three tumors
and we missed all of them?

563
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:32,934
What's the opposite
of a miracle?

564
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:36,644
I have a better chance
of finding it, now that I know
exactly where to look.

565
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,230
So, unless you have
a better idea,

566
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:45,567
I'm going to go CT his head
and then, if I have to,
remove his eye.

567
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:50,570
You remove this kid's eye,

568
00:31:50,653 --> 00:31:54,322
he's only going to be
half as good at
not making eye contact.

569
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:06,079
CUDDY: Hello?

570
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:08,873
Hello?

571
00:32:10,582 --> 00:32:11,708
Hello?

572
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:16,753
I have sad news for you.
She doesn't love you.

573
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:18,712
You're ugly
when you're jealous.

574
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:22,006
She showed up at my house
last night. Came on to me.

575
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:24,216
She's even more perfect
than I thought.

576
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,093
House, she's sick.

577
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:29,552
You say, "Sick,"
I say, "Freestylin'."

578
00:32:29,636 --> 00:32:31,804
The girl will have sex
with an invertebrate.

579
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:34,014
Come on, you're not that bad.

580
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,973
She has a problem.

581
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:37,808
You're not doing her
any favors by indulging her.

582
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:39,517
How could you lie like this?

583
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,476
Do you not have room
in your heart for love?

584
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:42,602
You don't believe me.

585
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:45,354
I didn't believe the kids
when they said that Susie
was sleeping with Johnny.

586
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:46,813
I didn't believe them then.
I don't believe them now.

587
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:49,982
I don't care that
Susie married Johnny.
She's mine.

588
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:53,943
She has a mole
on her right breast,
just below the nipple.

589
00:32:54,026 --> 00:32:55,068
No, she doesn't.

590
00:32:55,152 --> 00:32:56,319
You've seen her breasts?

591
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:58,696
It was a medical exam.
I was listening to her heart.

592
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:01,989
It went, "Greg-House.
Greg-House. Greg-House."

593
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:04,950
Fine. I'm lying.

594
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:09,077
But she did come back.
She's locked up in my office.

595
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:12,621
I was hoping
you could talk to her,
put an end to this.

596
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,131
Listen to me.

597
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,342
Do you have any idea
what you'd have

598
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:34,635
to look forward to
if you stayed with me?

599
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:37,970
Nine chances out of ten,
we'd both wind up in a jail.

600
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:41,639
You're only saying that
to make me go.

601
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:43,974
I'm saying it
'cause it's true.

602
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:49,811
Inside of us, we both know
that you belong with Victor.

603
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:53,730
Is there a Victor
in your class?

604
00:33:56,857 --> 00:34:00,776
If you're not with someone
your age, you'll regret it.

605
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,863
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but soon,
and for the rest of your life.

606
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:09,156
What about us?

607
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:11,449
We'll always have Fresno.

608
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:16,995
I'm no good at being noble,
but it doesn't take much
to see

609
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:18,412
that the problems
of two little people

610
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:21,664
don't amount to
a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

611
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:25,291
Someday you'll
understand that.

612
00:34:28,293 --> 00:34:32,046
Now, now,
here's looking at you.

613
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,342
Damn.

614
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,344
Was there an earthquake
when you were in Fresno?

615
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:44,470
What?

616
00:34:44,553 --> 00:34:46,138
I ask all my girlfriends that.

617
00:34:49,515 --> 00:34:51,224
Yeah, a little one.

618
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:53,392
Damn.

619
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:55,227
What? What?

620
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:57,311
What is it?
It's not love.

621
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,397
You have spore in your brain.

622
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:03,482
Coccidioides immitis.
California's full of them.

623
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:05,483
They get an earthquake,
they get released
into the air,

624
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:07,234
you breath it in,
you get a cold.

625
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:12,446
Turns into sinus congestion,
aches, weakness, milky tears,
and sometimes

626
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,031
loss of inhibition
and judgment.

627
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,533
Damn!

628
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,910
So, loving you,

629
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:27,414
wanting to have sex with you
was all just
the spores talking?

630
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,417
You'll probably live.

631
00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:37,878
Damn!

632
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:03,936
Hey! Don't touch his eye!

633
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,646
This is an appendectomy.

634
00:36:09,231 --> 00:36:11,524
Like I said,
don't touch his eye.

635
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:16,444
Why isn't he in surgery?

636
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:17,695
Some emergency bumped him.

637
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:19,071
We've got another room
in ten minutes.

638
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:20,613
You're not taking him in.

639
00:36:20,655 --> 00:36:22,198
Kill the lights.

640
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,534
He was seeing them
all the time.

641
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:28,493
What are you looking for?

642
00:36:28,535 --> 00:36:29,786
HOUSE: He was telling us
what he was seeing.

643
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:34,831
Telling us exactly what was
wrong with him. Drawing them
for us over and over again.

644
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:37,374
But nobody knew
how to speak autistic.

645
00:36:37,457 --> 00:36:39,750
When I asked him what he ate,
he even told me that.

646
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,752
What are you talking about?
What was he seeing?

647
00:36:44,462 --> 00:36:48,506
Hello, my pretties.
It's not a tumor, Foreman.

648
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:51,424
It's worms
swimming in his eye.

649
00:36:52,592 --> 00:36:56,344
Animal makes potty
in the sandbox,
boy plays in the sandbox.

650
00:36:56,428 --> 00:36:57,970
Boy eats the sand.

651
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:00,013
You can probably tell
where this is going by now.

652
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:01,597
Stool samples were
negative for parasites.

653
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:04,474
Raccoon roundworms are not
excreted by their human host.

654
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,683
Cameron tested the sand.

655
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:06,934
All of it?

656
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:10,144
Worms spread from his gut
to the rest of his body.

657
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,230
They attacked his lungs,
that's what made him scream
and caused the effusion.

658
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:16,815
They invade his liver,
sending dead liver cells
coursing through his system.

659
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:19,150
They attacked his eye
and the muscles
surrounding it,

660
00:37:19,192 --> 00:37:21,610
making his eyeball
do a back flip.

661
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:24,487
Laser photocoagulation
to fix the eye,

662
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:27,072
and a high dose of
benzimidazole
to kill the worms.

663
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:30,824
Wait a minute, that's it?
He's going to be okay?

664
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:32,658
Good news.

665
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:36,869
He's going to be with you
for a long, long time.

666
00:37:43,457 --> 00:37:45,500
I'm going to read you
something.

667
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:48,668
"Asperger Syndrome is a mild
and rare form of autism.

668
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:51,921
"It is typically characterized
by difficulty
establishing friendships,

669
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:55,923
"and playing with peers,
trouble accepting
conventional social rules,

670
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:59,884
"and they dislike any change
in setting or routine."

671
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:01,343
Or broadloom.

672
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:03,636
It doesn't say that last part,
but you get my point.

673
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,972
House doesn't have Asperger's.
The diagnosis is much simpler,
he's a jerk.

674
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:09,932
Why do you think
he took this case?

675
00:38:09,973 --> 00:38:11,599
Because he
believes these parents?

676
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:13,809
Because he wants to
help a young boy?

677
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:19,146
He sees himself in this kid,
and he's trying to
help himself.

678
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:23,565
He doesn't want this,
he needs it.

679
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,702
You're not autistic.
You don't even have
Asperger's.

680
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:42,994
You wish you did.

681
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:45,913
That would exempt you
from the rules,
give you freedom,

682
00:38:45,996 --> 00:38:50,040
absolve you of responsibility,
let you date 17-year-olds.

683
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:53,542
But most important,
it would mean that
you're not just a jerk.

684
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:58,879
At what point does a person
endlessly lecturing someone
make him a jerk?

685
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:10,928
First tongue kiss is an eight
on the happiness scale.

686
00:39:12,346 --> 00:39:16,432
Child being snatched back
from the brink of death,
that's a ten.

687
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:23,436
They're clocking in
at a very tepid
six point five,

688
00:39:24,353 --> 00:39:27,313
because they know what
they have to go back to.

689
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:34,068
Listen,

690
00:39:36,486 --> 00:39:37,570
thanks.

691
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:40,322
You saved his life.

692
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:43,240
Yeah, I know. See ya.

693
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:37,607
That was so good.

694
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:42,319
<i>(WAITING ON AN ANGEL PLAYING)</i>

695
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:51,032
That was a ten.

696
00:41:10,795 --> 00:41:12,379
All change is bad?

697
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,548
It's not true, you know.
