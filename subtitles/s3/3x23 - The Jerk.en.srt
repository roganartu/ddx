I'm having a moment.

57
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,020
This could be Foreman's last time
mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.

58
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,060
Which could create excess adrenaline,
causes the head pain and rage.

But not the personality disorder.

60
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,740
There is no personality disorder.

61
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,100
He's a teenager.

62
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,980
Being a teenager excuses the odd
inappropriate comment.

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,740
This kid say anything appropriate?

64
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,300
He's having cluster headaches.

65
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,180
Probably been having them for years.
Question is, what's causing them?

66
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,140
If it were just a cluster headache,
he'd have swelling around the eyes.

67
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,300
ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain.

68
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,740
Useless for this pain,
but it could've knocked down the swelling.

69
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,660
Best bet is a vascular problem.

70
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,180
Normal treatment for cluster headaches
is steroids, which the ER also gave him.

71
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,660
He's still in pain, which means...

72
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,820
Normal treatment is called
"normal treatment"

73
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,860
because sometimes
you have to use abnormal treatment.

74
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,460
Start him on blood thinners,

75
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,860
and give his noggin
transcranial magnetic stimulation.

76
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,420

The magnetic pulses activate nerve cells,
which will hopefully squelch the head pain.

about the other pain?

I'm pretty sure I get it.

111

I thought I was a bad mother.

112
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,140
And I hated myself

113
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,020
because I hated him.

for the personality disorder.

126
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,540
But no fat in the ventricles.
It's cluster headaches.

But treatments don't always work.
Symptoms never lie.

130
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,020
The only approved treatment left
for cluster headaches is brain surgery,

131
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,940

It was one of the other petty,

Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.

If you want me to stay,
tell me you want me to stay.

148
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,820
Would it matter?

149
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
No, but it'd be the adult way to handle it.

150
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,980
If the adult way doesn't work,
why bother with it?

151
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,500
I've been totally professional!

152
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,500
Gave two weeks' notice,
continued to work cases,

153
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,540
scheduled my interviews on my own time.

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,780
You have no right to screw with my future.

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,700
You're gonna be all whiny during
the differential diagnoses, aren't you?

00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,460
I only sabotage people I consider worth it.

158
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,060
You are one evil, cunning woman.

159
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,300
It's a massive turn-on.

160
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,100
You girls can gossip later.

161
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,860
What are you talking about?

162
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,780
You called New York Mercy
to have Foreman's job interview killed.

163
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,260
When I said, "You girls can gossip later,"
I was throwing you out, but in a polite way.

164
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,140
Well, I take it
you're off your anti-depressants.

165
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,820
You're deflecting.
Only I'm allowed to do that.

166
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,380
Does Foreman actually think I did that?

167
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,020
No. Just me.

168
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,260
But I know something he doesn't:
I didn't do it.

169
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,380
Why would I do it?

170
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,820
Do you want him to leave?
No.

171
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,420
Are you planning on doing something?

172
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,020
I'm waiting for board approval.

173
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,980
But if he takes the job,
there's nothing to be done.

174
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,500
You had to stop him.

175
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,980
It wasn't me.

176
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,140
What are you doing?

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,900
Looking for a tell.
Rapid eye blink, twitch of the lips.

178
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,700
Send in Nurse Unger
when you pass her on your way out.

179
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,300
Oh, almost forgot.

180
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,260
I need to give a 16-year-old
magic mushrooms

181
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,500
to treat a cluster headache.

182
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,740
Is that cool?

183
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,220
Yeah, no problem.

184
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,740
I was being sarcastic.

185
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,220
It wouldn't look that way
in the court transcript.

186
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,380
Mushrooms have psilocybins
that work on cluster headaches.

187
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,420
It's either that or cutting into his brain
and going on a fishing expedition.

188
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,140
I assume you've considered
he could have a psychogenic experience,

189
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,900
possibly suffer a fit of severe paranoia.

190
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,780
Well, I have now.

191
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,580
Yeah, it's definitely better
that the Dean of Medicine prescribes it

192
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,660
instead of an unhinged doctor
with a history of drug use.

193
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,580
Takes the stink off if the patient decides
to put on a cape and fly off the roof.

194
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,500
Low dose. No more than 10 milligrams,
tightly controlled setting.

195
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,180
And make sure the mother signs off on it.

196
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,660
Party on, Garth.

197
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,780
And don't stand in Foreman's way.
It's just wrong.

198
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,380
New research shows that a chemical
component in the mushrooms can...

199
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,460
Yeah, lots of technical medical stuff.
So when do I get them?

200
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,380
I went to college. I know about mushrooms.

201
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,220
Friend of a friend shot himself in the foot.

202
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,660
They're not giving me a gun, Enid!

203
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,180
Sign the consent form.

204
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,900
We'll be monitoring him,
but cardiac arrest is possible.

205
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,140
Big "E,"

206
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,380
small "N"...

207
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,740
And if the mushrooms don't work?

208
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,420
The next step would be
a type of brain surgery.

209
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,420
Oh, God.

210
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,940
Pain's getting worse!

211
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,500
Need shrooms now!

212
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,140
Oh, yeah.

213
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,980
Nate, how's the pain?

214
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,860
Hey, hey! It's Skippy, the bush kangaroo!

215
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,860
<i>Your head, Nate.
We need to know how the pain is.</i>

216
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,900
What I got here

217
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,780
is the opposite of pain.

218
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,340
That means you're suffering from
cluster headaches, which means hopefully...

219
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,380
Man, you're hot.

220
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,660
She's making me horny.

221
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
<i>Deal with it.</i>

222
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,540
Hey, hey, hey, you can't get me stoned,
then not close the deal.

223
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,580
<i>Shut up.
Take it easy.</i>

224
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,060
You'll regret saying no!

225
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,860
Check it out.

226
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,380
Oh, for God's sake.

227
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
Hold it.

228
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,260
What are you doing?

229
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,980
He has undersized testes.

230
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,460
His other secondary sexual characteristics
are normal.

231
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,260
If you want to curry favor with me,
avoid discussions of other men's testicles.

232
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,100
Thanks.

233
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,580
Focus on phrases like,

234
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,940
"You were right
about the cluster headaches."

235
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,540
You're wrong about what caused them.

236
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,820
Vascular problem in a major artery
wouldn't cause hypogonadism.

237
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,140
Okay, what causes rage, headaches,
personality disorder and hypogonadism?

238
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,700
Where's Foreman?

239
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,980
He's mad at me.

240
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,980
Why?
No reason.

241
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,340
Yeah. That makes sense.

242
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,060
The male genitals are controlled
by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

243
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,940
We're not talking about Foreman anymore.

244
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,260
Kid's being pummeled at school.

245
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,660
A couple blows to the head
can cause hypothalamic lesions.

246
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,980
We ever going to talk about what happens
when Foreman's gone?

247
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,540
If this were an employee-owned airline
in Scandinavia, yes.

248
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,620
It's not lesions.
His temperature would be all over the map.

249
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,420
Symptoms don't lie.

250
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,780
He's gone in less than a week,
and you haven't even read a résumé.

251
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,900
Doesn't even need to.
The two of us can handle it.

252
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,420
Craniopharyngioma fits the symptoms.

253
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,020
Biopsy the brat's pituitary.

254
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,060
And let the record show
I was right about the cluster headaches.

255
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,060
Forget it!

256
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,340
It's a straightforward procedure.

257
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
We thread an endoscopic tube
up through the nostril...

258
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,060
And cut something out of my brain? No way.

259
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,900
If it's a tumor, it could kill you.

260
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,460
Just give me more shrooms, okay?
I'll be fine.

261
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,740
You only need my consent, right?

262
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,500
Yeah, but it'll be a lot easier if...

263
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,700
Do whatever you have to do.

264
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,260
You don't touch me, all right?
You can touch me, just not my brain.

265
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,020
Nate, you got to do this.
I can't take it anymore...

266
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,540
My God, Mom! Save me
the melodramatic hand-wringing, okay?

267
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,980
Loosen up! Get yourself coited.

268
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,660
I'm going to give him a sedative.

269
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,100
You're decent-looking, Dr. Skippy.

270
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,500
Why don't you take her for a ride?

271
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,540
Nate?

272
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,020
<i>Are you in pain?</i>

273
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,020
Nate?

274
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,860
His heart rate's normal. Respiration's even.

275
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,780
What's happening?
What's the matter with him?

276
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,980
He's jaundiced. His liver's shutting down.

277
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,340
CHASE: We've started him
on sodium polystyrene sulfonate.

278
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,100
His liver's operating at about 20%

279
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,700
and deteriorating fast.

280
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,820
Which means he'll be dead long before
Foreman turns in his parking pass.

281
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,020
So what causes personality disorder,
head pain, blah, blah, blah,

282
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,500
and liver failure?

283
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,380
Liver failure can cause
hypogonadism, head pain.

284
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,140
Altered mental status
leads to the personality disorder and rage.

285
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,140
All we need to do is figure out
what caused the liver failure.

286
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,300
Yes. Also, we need to figure out
how symptoms yesterday

287
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,140
can be caused by liver failure today.

288
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,180
If his liver's failing now,
it wasn't great yesterday.

289
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,220
If it wasn't operating at capacity,
it could have caused...

290
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,220
(EXCLAIMING)

291
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,100
Don't sneak up on a person like that!

292
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,300
I'm listening.

293
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,940
Well, listening doesn't help me.

294
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,420
Okay. Let's go with the liver
and a time-machine theory.

295
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,300
Foreman, what causes liver problems?

296
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,620
Wilson's Disease.

297
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,300
No. Ceruloplasmin is normal.

298
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,740
No enlargement and no palpable mass,
so no cancer.

299
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,140
Could be a narrowing of the bile ducts.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.

300
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,220
Most liver damage begins
with what we put in our bodies. Foreman?

301
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,100
Angry teen... Alcohol.

302
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,860
No. Blood tests were negative.

303
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,940
No signs of drug use or
acetaminophen poisoning in his tox screen.

304
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,660
Maybe the water was contaminated.

305
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,460
His mother would also be sick.

306
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,660
Cuddy?

307
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,820
Sounded like someone would back.

308
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,140
Go.

309
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,580
We'll try and muddle through
without your blank stare to guide us.

310
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,100
So if it's not the bad things he's putting in,
what about the good things?

311
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,660
He was raised a vegetarian.

312
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,900
"Was raised."

313
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,900
Means he's all grown up,
or he's not a vegetarian anymore.

314
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,780
He started eating red meat
a few months ago.

315
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,380
Unless he's been buying cuts of mad cow,

316
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,100
his body would have no problem
metabolizing it.

317
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,420
What if he had an OTC deficiency?

318
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,540
Body can't metabolize nitrogen,
damages the liver.

319
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,540
Run a hamburger test.

320
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
It's exactly what it sounds like.

321
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,460
Stuff him full of meat,
wait for his ammonia levels to spike.

322
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,060
I'll double your salary.

323
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,620
Chase and Cameron would mutiny
if they found out.

324
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,820
Chase and Cameron wouldn't be heading up
their own diagnostic group.

325
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,620
You'd work in parallel with House.
It'll be your practice.

326
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,540
Separate staff, separate cases,
complete autonomy.

327
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,780
I've only been doing this for three years.

328
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,220
Three years under House.

329
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,340
No better training.

330
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,900
And when that case comes along
that I can't figure out,

331
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,140
you know who I'd have to go to.

332
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,980
Or you can just let that patient die.
That's completely up to you.

333
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,380
No.

334
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,620
Why?

335
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,060
He's evil.

336
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,900
He didn't sabotage your interview.

337
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,940
How do you know?

338
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,220
Because I did.

339
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,060
I didn't!

340
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,900
You believed me.
Means you're not sure House did it.

341
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,740
Well, somebody did it.

342
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,740
Somebody here did it.

343
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,900
I can't work here.

344
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,860
(DOOR OPENS)

345
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,500
This isn't a medical procedure.

346
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,580
This is just about Doogie
making me eat garbage.

347
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,380
We need to see
how your liver processes the proteins.

348
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,980
Then get me a steak. Some roast beef.

What if I brought him
something from home?

there's no chemicals or preservatives

Trust me.
It'll be a lot less messy if you do it yourself.

You killed Foreman's job interview.

366
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,260
Why would I...
Somebody did.

367
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,260
Wasn't me, and it wasn't House,

368
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,580
which means it has to be somebody
who thought he was protecting House,

369
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,500
which means it has to be somebody
who actually likes House,

370
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,940
which means it's either you

371
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,780
or the weird night janitor
who wears his pants backwards.

I want Foreman to leave.

373
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,220
House has to realize
he needs someone who stands up to him.

A few tummy aches

What?
You're paranoid.

383
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,740
You made that call.

384
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,500
And because of that call,

385
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,020
you basically guaranteed
Foreman's out of here.

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,820
I thought it'd be fun
to work on my boat with him.

387

And you went shirtless,
because skin cancer looks cool.

When Daddy works on his boat,

393
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,540
does he have a cooler
with lots of brown bottles with long necks?

394
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,300
And does Daddy like to lie down
on his boat and go nap-nap in the sun?

If he had tuberculosis,
it wouldn't be his fault either.

No, I mean, I literally don't believe it.

00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,220
Cuddy wouldn't fire you
for something like that.

473
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,900

You were looking for a reaction.

477
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,300
You were looking for me to feel bad for you,

But how am I going to save you?

Unless you think I'm the one
who really did it.

480
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,140
Cuddy's logic was,

481
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,660
Foreman's valuable to House,
I care about House,

482
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,980
ergo, I would do anything to save him.

483
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,060
And your logic was, I care about House
as much as you do, ergo...

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,020
It wasn't me.

Foreman thought it was House.
House thought it was Cuddy.

00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,540
Cuddy thought it was Wilson.
Wilson thought it was me.

498
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,460
And you think it was me?

499
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,420

Then why would I do...

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,460
I think you sabotaged Foreman
just to sabotage Foreman.

504
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,020
So everyone's a suspect
because everyone wants to help House,

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,340
except for me, I'm a suspect
because I'm a petty, vindictive jerk?

I would do something like that?

00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,740
It was someone.

00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,940
It wasn't me.

He's got a partial HPRT enzyme deficiency.

517
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,260
Means he could have
Kelley-Seegmiller Syndrome.

518
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,460
But it's a partial deficiency,
so it may not be Kelley-Seegmiller.

519
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,180
Yes, those are the two options. It is,

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,220
or it isn't.

00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,820
If he had Kelley-Seegmiller,
he wouldn't just be aggressive.

523
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,460
He'd be self-mutilating.
Chewing his lips, banging his head.

524
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,100
Lovely disease.

525
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,420
Degenerative, fatal, incurable.

526
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,940
I wonder if that's why Cameron's
on the "not" side?

527
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,420
That and the fact that symptoms don't lie.

528
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,100
Kelley-Seegmiller carriers
self-mutilate when they're stressed.

529
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,820
He's in ICU with a failing liver
and no kidneys.

530
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,660
Yeah, his life is sweet.

531
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,020
His vegetarian diet could have limited
the purines in his system,

532
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,980
slowing the disease's progress.

533
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,500
So let's speed it up.

534
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Why?

535
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,500
So you two kids will stop fighting.

536
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,940
Also, I don't feel like waiting
for respiratory failure.

537
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,020
Chase, find some way
for the mother to get lost for a while.

538
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,460
I'm going to stress this kid
till he bites off a finger.

539
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,100
You move me to geriatrics?

540
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,700
Who are you?

541
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,980
Dr. McCaney.

542
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,980
The man who's going to kick your ass
all over this chess board.

543
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,060
Well, I'm too weak to...

544
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,540
To bite yourself. Yeah.

545
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,380
You need some liquid energy.

546
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,900
Now if you consent,
I'm gonna give you this shot of adrenaline.

I don't want to play.

Aside from being indicative
of pituitary issues

550
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,500
and certain kinds of genetic disorders,
small testicles also indicate

551
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,260
that you're a big chicken.

552
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,060
Please don't make me do the sound effect.

553
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,420
You're not going to goad me into playing.

554
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,140
Didn't think I'd have to.

555
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,340
Thought you'd just jump at the chance
of humiliating someone.

556
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,380
Age before cripple. I'm white.

557
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,580
It is on.

558
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,260
Bird's Opening. Passive approach.
Sign of a coward.

559
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,500
Sicilian Defense. Sign of an idiot.

560
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,620
Arrogance has to be earned.

561
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,820
Tell me what you've done to earn yours.

562
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,780
I can walk.

563
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,660
I don't bleed out of my penis.

564
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,180
Check.

565
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,940
You know, it's a real thin line
between tortured genius

566
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,540
and awkward kid who can't get girls
because he's creepy.

567
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,740
Why are you doing this?

568
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,620
To stress you out.

569
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,140

570
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,900
Yeah, but why?

571
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,540
Well, I'd tell you,

572
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,140
but I figure it's more stressful
if you don't know why.

573
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,700
Yeah, well, I'm not feeling too stressed.

574
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,460
You know that no one likes you, right?

575
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,940
Yeah. Well, anybody like you?

576
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,260
You're dying.

577
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,460

My knight to E7.

Queen to H5.

Save what's left of your dignity.

590

(ALARM BEEPING)

593
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,580
Crap.

594
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,260
He's having a seizure.

595
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,260
Four milligrams I.V. Lorazepam.

596
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,300
Right away.

597
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,140
I hate this kid.

598
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,660
I like this kid.

599
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,020
Did you get the job?

600
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,700
They're going to let me know.

601
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,620
Kelley-Seegmiller didn't cause this seizure.

602
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,540
So we've got one more symptom,
one less diagnosis.

603
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,980
I assume they're going to call for references.

604
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,060
Did you give them my name?

605
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
No.

606
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,900
Amyloidosis can cause seizures,

607
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,900
and the protein buildup
could cause organ failure.

608
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,500
Wouldn't alter his personality.

609
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,220
Whose name did you give?

610
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,300
My last boss.

611
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,340
Ouch.

612
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,220
That can't look good.

613
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,580
I hate this kid.

614
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,300
What if we're not dealing
with one condition?

615
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,100
What if it's multiple conditions?

616
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,660
It's got to be one. It's always one.

617
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,060
But nothing explains
this constellation of symptoms.

618
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,380
We've got to be missing something.

619
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,220
Maybe the kid lied about some medication.
Maybe he's hiding something...

620
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,460
Why would he be hiding something?

621
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,740
Well, I don't know, because he's evil?

622
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,060
What if he is?

623
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,540
What if the symptoms lied?

624
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,260
There.

625
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,260
Now all we're looking at is a simple evil jerk
with amyloidosis.

626
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,500
You're not being objective.

627
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,940
Amyloidosis was your idea.

628
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,500
You were right. It doesn't fit the symptoms.

629
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,380
Yeah, it does. Look.

630
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,420
You crossed it off
because you want to hate the kid,

631
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,860
and you can't hate him if he's a victim...

632
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,900
You want him to be a victim because
you want to believe that people are good.

633
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,100
And if they're not,
it's got to be a chemical problem.

634
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,100
Except they're not, and it's not.

635
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,460
Flush him with immunosuppressants.

636
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,300
Get a biopsy to confirm,
and find him a marrow donor.

637
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,500
What'll happen to him?

638
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,340
Substances called amyloid proteins

639
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,100
build up in the body's organs,
shutting them down.

640
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,940
It's a fairly rare disease,
and I'm afraid it can be fatal.

641
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,500
So, do you operate or something
to take them out?

642
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,900
He needs a bone marrow transplant.

643
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,980
Dr. Cameron is searching the donor bank.

644
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,140
We should test you as well.

645
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,100
When you first told me he was sick, I was

646
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,820
happy.

647
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,540
Relieved.

648
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,380
Now...

649
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,140
Nate, I'm going to take
a small piece of nerve from your ankle.

650
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,460
Let me know if you feel any pain.

651
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,860
I'm burning up.

652
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,060
Why can't you just knock me out
like you did last time?

653
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,380
Wish I could.

654
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,580
But your body has to be clear
so it's ready for a marrow transplant.

655
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,100
Hey, Dr. X.

656
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,300
I know you've busted ass trying to save me.

657
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,380
It's all right.

658
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,220
I wasn't going to thank you.

659
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,540
I was going to tell you

660
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,540
you really suck at this.

661
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,420
We're doing our best.

662
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,820
That's sort of my point.

663
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,060
Your best really sucks.

664
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,020
Nerve biopsy was clean.
No evidence of amyloidosis.

665
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,980
It was your idea. Don't give up on it so fast.

666
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,300
He's running a fever.

667
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,900
If it's two conditions,
one of them's got to be an infection.

668
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,460
We should start him on antibiotics,
see what clears up, what doesn't.

669
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,940
Is he having trouble breathing?

670
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,780
Yeah, he has mucus in his chest
from an infection.

671
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,820
Could also be from an amyloid buildup.

672
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,140
Keep him on immunosuppressants
and biopsy somewhere else.

673
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,380
His sinuses.

674
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,140
Look, you got two choices:

675
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,100
Engage me in a futile argument
then do what I asked,

676
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,620
or just do what I asked.

677
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,820
You're not ready.

678
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,180
There was a third choice.

679
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,060
"Don't do what I asked."

680
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,780
You could have defied me,
stuck the kid on antibiotics,

681
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,180
but you didn't.

682
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,580
Because you still trust my judgment
more than your own.

683
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,860
You sabotaged Foreman's job interview,
didn't you?

684
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,540
Foreman's already been over this.

685
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,060
It wasn't me.

686
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,140
Everybody's chasing ghosts over this,

687
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,700
which means either nobody did it

688
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,220
or somebody wants everybody
chasing ghosts.

689
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,340
Now, who does that sound like?

690
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,740
And why would I do that?

691
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,740
Because as long as Foreman
thought you were guilty,

692
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,060
he was going to be useless around here.

693
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,140
You know, sometimes I forget
why I hired you.

694
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,780
You cost him a good opportunity
and gained nothing.

695
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,940
I cost him a crappy opportunity.

696
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,140
New York Mercy is where you go
to treat boils and cysts and build a 401-K.

697
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,580
If you want him to stay, tell him.

698
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,180
I don't, and there'd be no point.

699
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,420
You do.

700
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,540
And the point would be
to make him feel like he's wanted.

701
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,900
He doesn't need that.

702
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,180
All right, then, it'd make him feel
like maybe you weren't evil.

703
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,060
He needs that.

704
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,020
Talk to Foreman.

705
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,060
We dumped one symptom,

706
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,540
but forgot to add one.

707
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,340
Revenge time, Nate.

708
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,300
Are you...
Yes, I am.

709
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,900
Black or white?

710
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,660
Just limp away.

711
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,500
He doesn't want to play. Leave him alone.

712
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,820
Pick one, or this comes out.

713
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,140
And for all you know,
this is really important.

714
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,580
(GROANS)

715
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,620
Stop it!

716
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,900
That hurts, right?

717
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,900
Which is odd,
because I'm really enjoying this.

718
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,940
You hold the pieces that way
because you can't bend your thumb,

719
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,540
because your bones
have formed abnormally,

720
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,620
thanks to all the crap that's been
pushing its way in between them.

721
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,060
Actually, this stuff isn't important at all.

722
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,340
Your doctors said
he needs immunosuppressants.

723
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,220
They're idiots. It's not amyloidosis.

724
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,660
It's iron.

725
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,380
He's got hemochromatosis.

726
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,380
The body absorbs iron from food
but can't process it, can't get rid of it.

727
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,100
<i>Idle iron is the devil's playground.</i>

728
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,060
<i>Builds up in the organs and joints,
whacking them in the process.</i>

729
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,620
Causes all the symptoms.

730
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,780
Including something that wasn't a symptom.

731
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,940
Those body aches?
They were not from the fighting.

732
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,740
His personality issues?

733
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,860
Sorry.

734
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,660
The iron's innocent on that count.

735
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,580
Your kid's a jerk.

736
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,860
Yeah, it's probably your fault.

737
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,380
Although, if you'd stayed off the meat
like your mom said,

738
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,500
you'd have half as much iron
and be twice less

739
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,580
almost dead.

740
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,980
(GROANS)

741
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,060
Oh, nurse!

742
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,620
(ALARM BEEPING)

743
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,900
This patient is bleeding, for some reason.

744
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,940
Is he going to be okay?

745
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,300
He'll need dialysis,

746
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,780
gonna have to get his blood drained
every few months for the rest of his life.

747
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,260
My condolences.

748
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,540
It's going to be a long and annoying life.

749
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,460
And I wouldn't have taken your bishop.

750
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,940
I'd have moved my queen to D6,
defusing the threat,

751
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,420
then rook to E8, attacking the king's pawn.

752
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,900
I'd have lost the exchange
but won the game.

753
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,180
I know.

754
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,820
I was bluffing.

755
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,100
And that's why

756
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,660
you lost.

757
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,180
Jerk.

758
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,900
You just here to watch
or you got something to say?

759
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,460
Still running the new biopsy
for amyloidosis?

760
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,340
Yeah. Still nothing.

761
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,180
Run the test again. Recheck your results.

762
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,860
Looks like you're in for an all-nighter.
