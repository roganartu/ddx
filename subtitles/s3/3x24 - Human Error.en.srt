the medical records,

she is with Dr. House?

She's with another doctor
who is part of Dr. House's
team.

102

No, she's supposed to
see Dr. House.

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
That's the way it
works with Dr. House.

take that approach,

then we may as
well just throw out

160

everything we got
from the husband
and start over.

161
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,960
We could do that,
or we could do
something productive.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,640
Start her on
Interferon for the MS,

Well done. Do it.

he wants, a pat on the head?

Go do your job.

it's not a pleasant
diagnosis to hear...

00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,360
But it hurts.

176
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,640
Her pain is getting worse!

177
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,160
Your treatment isn't working
because it's not MS.

178
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,520
Does this hurt?

179
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,640
(SCREAMS)

180
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,040
Wow! Well, either Foreman's
way stronger than he thinks
he is or...

181
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,640
Seriously. Or?

182
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,000
She's too young for
osteoporosis that severe.

183
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,800
And too old for
osteogenesis imperfecta.

184
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,240
Which leaves bone cancer.

185
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
Cancer's a long shot.
HOUSE: Why?

186
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,720
Because
metastatic tumors don't
explain the abnormal MRI,

187
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,080
kidney damage, cotton mouth,
double vision.

188
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,280
Oh, wait, they do!

189
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,520
Infection could
do all that, too.

190
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,680
It's not an infection.

191
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,840
Because you know
the nonexistent
medical records confirm

192
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,880
that the brilliant doctors
in Cuba treated her
for infection,

193
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,240
or because you're trying to
kiss up to Foreman?

194
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,560
Because an infection
would cause a fever,

195
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,240
and the brilliant doctors
who work in my office

196
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
have already crossed that
off the list because
the husband...

197
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,240
You're the one who said
it's possible for two people

198
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,160
to have the same symptom
for two different reasons.

199
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
And you're the one
who said if we do that,

200
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
we might as well
throw out everything
we got from the husband.

201
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
Right, and then
you said we should
do something productive

202
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
like breaking her arm?

203
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
Foreman didn't break her arm.

204
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,680
Of course he didn't.
Cancer did.

205
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,480
Put her in a PET scan,
see what else it's breaking.

206
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,960
This isn't gonna work!
He's not a moron!

207
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,400
You can't just agree with
everything he says for
two days

208
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,960
and hope he forgets
the last three years
and how much he hates you!

209
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,520
Anything else?

210
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,560
When you get the results
of the PET scan, let me know.

211
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,960
I don't really care
if Foreman stays
or goes, but...

212
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,080
You're fired.

213
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
(MUMBLES)

214
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,080
What,
because I yelled at you?

215
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,520
Because you've
been here the longest,

216
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,040
learned all you can or
you haven't learned
anything at all.

217
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,840
Either way,
it's time for a change.

218
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,360
Fine.

219
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,960
FOREMAN:
No tumors in her arm.

220
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,440
Synovial membrane
is working fine.

221
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,000
No hot spots,
no bone cancer.

222
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,160
Maybe we should be
looking for something else.

223
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,880
Is it raining out?

224
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,120
House fired me.
What?

225
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,880
Because you yelled at him?

226
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,760
"Time for a change"
was the official explanation.

227
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,400
It makes no sense.

228
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,920
Since when does
House make sense?

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,960
He always makes sense.

230
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,000
He's angry.

231
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,680
Yes, it's all about you,
Foreman.

232
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,560
He's upset you're leaving,
so he fires Chase.

233
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,080
Excuse me.

234
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,120
On the humerus,
she's got a hot spot.

235
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,000
Why'd you fire Chase?

236
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Sure thing.

237
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,880
First you tell me
the results of the PET scan.

238
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,120
Did you fire him for me?

239
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,320
Would you stay if I did?

240
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,720
You asked him to fire Chase?

241
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,080
No!
Yes!

242
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,600
You're frustrated with Foreman

243
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,240
so you lash out,
kick the dog?

244
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,440
He's not gone five minutes
and the name-calling starts.

245
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,720
What's on the PET scan?

246
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,720
Why'd you fire Chase?

247
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,280
Do you know
what's on the PET scan?

248
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,520
You two, out.

249
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,680
Wait!
What's on the PET scan?

250
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,720
You can't dump
your entire department

251
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,200
just because
you don't know how
to deal with an issue.

252
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,320
Yes,
they are all irreplaceable.

253
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,360
If only in this country
we'd figure out a way

254
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
to somehow teach people
to interpret PET scans.

255
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,760
What the hell's
wrong with you?
You fired Chase?

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,680
I don't suppose you know
what's on my patient's
PET scan.

257
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,840
I told you to show Foreman
you have a heart.

258
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,720
How does that translate
into you being a bastard?

259
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
So that's a no.

260
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,520
Pick up the phone
and tell Chase
you made a mistake.

261
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,040
Un-fire him.

262
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,240
Chase, if you know what's on
the PET scan, call me back.

263
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,080
Cut the crap.

264
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,560
Chase is a good doctor.

265
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,280
Sorry,
you're in the wrong room.

266
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,600
My name on the door,
my team, my decisions.

267
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,880
My building,
my floor, my people.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,640
(PHONE RINGING)

269
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
Hold that reprimand. House.

270
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,600
Dr. Chase! How are you?

271
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,920
Thank you.
You are indispensable.

272
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,480
You're still fired. Sorry.

273
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,360
Wow, that was awkward.

274
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,720
PET scan revealed
a blood clot in
my patient's arm.

275
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
Which means goodbye.

276
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,240
Still got two people
working for me,

277
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,040
gotta get one of them
to do my job.

278
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,240
A clot means
a heart problem.

279
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,440
We have to do
an emergency angiogram.

280
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,880
But you're not sure
it's a blood clot?

281
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,880
PET scan
can't determine
that with certainty.

282
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,360
So you have no better idea
what's wrong with her than
when we first got here?

283
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,880
We've ruled out MS.
I told you it wasn't MS.

284
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,160
Where is Dr. House?

285
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,680
Dr. House has
left for the night.

286
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,840
He'll be here in the morning
to review the results,

287
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,080
if you sign the consent.

288
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,840
But, you know,
you could call him at home.

289
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,960
He doesn't always pick up,
so keep calling.

290
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,560
Thank you.

291
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,400
(RINGING)

292
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,400
<i>ESTEBAN.: Dr. House,
it's Esteban Hernandez again.</i>

293
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,480
<i>As soon as you get home,
it's very important
you call me.</i>

294
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,200
<i>(PHONE RINGING)</i>

295
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,880
<i>Hello, yes, Dr. House,
it's Esteban Hernandez.</i>

296
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,440
<i>As soon as you get home,
if can you please call me?</i>

297
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,400
The catheter is in
her femoral artery.

298
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
Why are you telling me that?

299
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,640
Because you're assisting.

300
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,800
Do I look like I'm assisting?

301
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,680
I had nothing to do
with Chase's termination.

302
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,360
MARINA: Is everything okay?

303
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,120
You're doing fine, Marina.

304
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,480
The dye will take a minute
to work its way through
your system.

305
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,440
Why would you tell House
you're leaving because
he's a jerk?

306
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,840
Because it's the truth.

307
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,040
Did you give
an angry Cuban
my home number?

308
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Why would you do that?

309
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,120
You're not
turning into House,
you're worse than him.

310
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,000
Let me get this straight.
Instead of picking up
the phone

311
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,480
and talking to
a patient for five minutes,

312
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,960
you gave up on sleep
and drove in here.

313
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,240
My chest!

314
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,640
(BEEPING)

315
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,080
She's in V-Tach.

316
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,480
What did you do?
Nothing!

317
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,600
Must have hit something.
You nick an artery?

318
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,960
She has no pulse.

319
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,160
It hurts.

320
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,320
She has no pulse,
but she's talking.

321
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,440
Cough!
Cough again!
Keep coughing!

322
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,000
Lt'll push blood
into your head,
keep you conscious.

323
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,720
Push one
milligram Epinephrine.

324
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,080
Will that help?

325
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,040
No. But it is amazingly cool.

326
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
We need to get her on bypass!

327
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
We need to keep her here.

328
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,760
If this was a clot,
the force of bypass

329
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,200
will blow it into
her brain, kill her.

330
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,640
If we continue CPR,
she'll lose blood flow,

331
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,680
which will
cause brain damage.

332
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
What caused
the heart to stop?

333
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,840
Let's assume
it wasn't human error.

334
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,280
I didn't nick an artery,
it just stopped.

335
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,520
I said let's assume.

336
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
The only other option
is electrical instability.

337
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,040
No ST segment changes.

338
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,120
We need to tell the husband.

339
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
Tell him what?
We have no idea
what happened.

340
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,200
House?

341
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,480
Keep going until
I figure this out.

342
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,480
House!

343
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,640
Jeez.

344
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,280
At 47,
I hope my colon looks
better than this guy's.

345
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,400
Isolating
the first transverse...

346
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,800
<i>Help!
I'm trapped
inside a monitor!</i>

347
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,680
Not a good time, House.

348
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,040
My patient lost her heartbeat
during routine cardiac
catheterization, so...

349
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,320
Human error.

350
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,440
<i>It's not human error.</i>

351
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,680
Electrical instability?

352
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,960
Pre-procedure EKG was normal,
no syncope.

353
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,000
Ischemia?

354
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,840
<i>Foreman said no
ST segment changes.</i>

355
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,640
Human error is
the only other possible...

356
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,120
<i>It's not human error.</i>

357
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,840
Of course it's human error!

358
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,560
You don't want Foreman
to have made a mistake

359
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,680
because then
you'd have to mock him.

360
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,160
And that would put a crimp
in your brilliant plan of
keeping him

361
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
by having a breakdown
and firing Chase.

362
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
<i>Did you just
spit on the monitor?</i>

363
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,120
<i>You know I can't see you.</i>

364
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,480
<i>Human error would not
explain her symptoms.</i>

365
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,240
You mean her heart stopping?

366
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,920
<i>I mean her foot pain,
her back pain.</i>

367
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
House!
I'm busy!
You have a team,

368
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,200
run your differential
with them.

369
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,400
<i>Foreman and Cameron
are doing CPR.</i>

370
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,240
Then you shouldn't
have fired Chase.

371
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,760
Change is fun, huh?

372
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,440
Five, six, seven, eight!

373
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,480
Go!

374
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,920
Someone's gotta
talk to the husband.

375
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,960
He thought
this whole thing was
gonna last 45 minutes!

376
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,880
A half hour more of this,
nothing to talk about,

377
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,320
we won't be able
to bring her back.
We gotta get her on bypass.

378
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,040
House still isn't
answering his phone.

379
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,520
You, get in here.

380
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,120
Go!

381
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,360
Excuse me,
my wife was supposed
to be back an hour ago...

382
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,560
As soon as we know anything,
we'll call you.

383
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,880
Thank you.

384
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,360
Human Behavior finals
will also get into

385
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,320
clinical presentations
of mania,

386
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,200
and we'll touch on
Stanislas Dehaene's
PET scans.

387
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,400
Excuse me, Professor.

388
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,360
House, when we're
done with our rounds...

389
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,920
My patient
has no heartbeat.

390
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,280
Stopped when
we inserted a catheter
during a routine angiogram.

391
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,720
Anyone tells me
why her heart stopped

392
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,880
gets an A in
Dr. Cuddy's class.

393
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,960
Anyone?

394
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Human error?

395
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,440
Yeah. I'm polling
first-year medical students

396
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,000
because I hadn't
considered human error.

397
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,320
Marfan's Syndrome?

398
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,520
Structural abnormalities
would show up on the echo.

399
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,680
You get a C. Yeah?

400
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,640
Botox injections.

401
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,720
F.

402
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,720
If the injection was tainted
with live botulism, it'd fit.

403
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,440
B-plus.

404
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,760
Unfortunately, she missed
her last Botox appointment

405
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,040
due to a boating accident,
but send me your résumé.

406
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,520
House, time's up.

407
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,280
Good Lord,
you smell like musk ox.

408
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,760
Either our
patient goes on bypass,
or I call time of death.

409
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,600
Your patient isn't
already on bypass?

410
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,840
I was worried about a clot.

411
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,280
How long?
Three hours.

412
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,240
House. Bypass, now!

413
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,840
NURSE: Clear the hall!

414
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,240
MAN: Out of the way, please!

415
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,600
Let's go! Excuse us!

416
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,720
Dr. Foreman! My wife!
What has happened?

417
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,680
Her heart stopped.
We have to get her on bypass.

418
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,920
He needs to wait outside.

419
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,080
Got it?

420
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,440
Dr. House.

421
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,920
You can vacuum later.

422
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,000
I am not the janitor,
I am Esteban Hernandez.

423
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,760
What happened to my wife?

424
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,240
Her heart stopped.

425
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,920
Why did her heart stop?

426
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
Well, if I knew that,
I'd be coming to you.

427
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,960
Tell me where you take her.

428
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,320
Tell me
what is happen to her?

429
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,440
"Happening."
It's a present participle.

430
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
Not a particularly
interesting form of speech.

431
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
Kind of like
this conversation.

432
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,160
But I risk my life
to see you.

433
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,120
I looked you up.
You fix people.

434
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,760
When everyone else
gives up, you don't!

435
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,720
And now you insult me?

436
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,200
Ignore my wife?

437
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Helps my process.

438
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
You do not ignore my wife,
okay?

439
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,160
She is everything to me.

440
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Well, then you do
not ignore your wife.

441
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,120
You just sit here!
You don't talk to people.

442
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,760
How do you fix something
if you don't look at it?

443
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,000
GOODING:
Turn on bypass, please.

444
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,080
Good. Good distal flow.

445
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,960
Need to look
at the heart.

446
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,080
Why?

447
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,520
I can't find my wallet.
Pick it up. Turn it over.

448
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,480
I don't see anything
physically wrong with
her heart.

449
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,240
Hearts don't
stop for no reason.

450
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
Okay.
Take your look.

451
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,080
You see anything wrong?

452
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,120
Give her a jump-start.

453
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,520
Clear. Clear.

454
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,960
Clear.

455
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,240
And again.

456
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,760
Clear! Clear! Clear!

457
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,800
Again.

458
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,520
Yeah, seventh time
is the charm. Sorry.

459
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,480
I'll keep her on
bypass until the husband
has a chance to say goodbye.

460
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,800
I'm not telling
the husband anything

461
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,080
until I can
tell him why his...

462
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,320
It doesn't matter.

463
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,120
Her heart can't start.
She's dead.

464
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,560
I got you something.

465
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,960
I'll miss you.

466
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,000
I know you won't miss me,
but...

467
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,080
I just thought
it would be nice
for you to have that.

468
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,720
I will miss you.

469
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,360
Can I have a hug, too?

470
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,960
The surgeon found nothing.

471
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,720
He can't start her heart.

472
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,800
What a thoughtful gift.

473
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,440
Nice reminder
of intellectual theft

474
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,040
to hang at your new
place of employment.

475
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,760
You two can go.
Say hi to Chase for me.

476
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,440
You're wearing lipstick.

477
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,360
We can stay. We can run
another differential.

478
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,560
You two have no theories
about why the heart stopped,

479
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,760
which means I don't need you.
Go.

480
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,360
It's too late for theories.
We need to tell the husband.

481
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,880
Tell him what?
That it's over.

482
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,800
Why?
Because her
heart won't start!

483
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,520
How can we tell him
there's no hope

484
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,520
if we don't know
why there's no hope?

485
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,280
He's not gonna pull
the plug on his wife.

486
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,760
He risked his life
to get her to me.

487
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,240
If he pulls the plug,
it means he's failed.

488
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,200
If he pulls the plug,
it means you've failed.

489
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,640
And you're okay with that?

490
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,280
Go.

491
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,640
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

492
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,840
Hey.
Hey.

493
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
You look great.

494
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,560
You know House firing you
has nothing to do with you.

495
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,560
The why doesn't matter.

496
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,280
Foreman will end up staying,
House will call you,

497
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,120
probably yell at you
for not showing up.

498
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,760
It's okay.

499
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,160
He's right.
It's time for a change.

500
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
You were right, too.

501
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,440
The whole "It's Tuesday,
I like you." It was silly.

502
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,040
Oh, don't give me that look.

503
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,720
Don't feel sorry for me.

504
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,600
Getting this job
was the best thing that
has ever happened to me.

505
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,520
Everything about it.
And losing it?

506
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,680
Well, I think it's
gonna be good, too.

507
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,360
I'll miss you.

508
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,000
Have you got time for
a drink or something?

509
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,120
I think I should go.

510
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,120
Yeah.

511
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
CUDDY: How's it going?

512
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,520
The way the security
light hits your legs,

513
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,280
looks good.

514
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,920
Thank you.

515
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,520
If you're here
to yell at me about

516
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,640
the Foreman-Chase situation,
it can wait.

517
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,440
When do you plan
on telling the husband

518
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,120
it's time to say
goodbye to his wife?

519
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,840
Haven't put a clock on it.

520
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,080
Other than your curiosity,
do you have any reason to
keep her on bypass?

521
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,360
Patient's husband
prefers her not dead.

522
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,760
Or you want
a storybook ending

523
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,200
for the young man who
crossed the ocean
for his wife.

524
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,840
This is not an act.

525
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,480
I don't care.
Then pull the plug!

526
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,760
What if I can fix it,
but I just don't know it yet?

527
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,960
I know you care.

528
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,320
I don't care!

529
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,920
I really don't care.

530
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,600
My motives are pure.

531
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,440
If we do an autopsy
and we see, "Oops,

532
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,480
"if I'd thought
of that crazy idea,
we could have saved her,"

533
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,280
then the husband
might be upset.

534
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,360
You've done all you can do.

535
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,600
It's time to let go.

536
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,920
I was told
you didn't believe in God.

537
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
I don't.

538
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,080
I promise my wife
I'll do everything
I can to fix her.

539
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,160
If I don't pray,
then I don't do everything.

540
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,720
It's not working.
She's not coming back.

541
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,040
If you want to say goodbye,
you can come down to the ICU,

542
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,320
and then I'll take her
off bypass.

543
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,360
I'm sorry. I should have...

544
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,240
Marina, I am so sorry.

545
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,560
When you turn
the machine off,
that's it?

546
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,520
Yeah.

547
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,560
Right now,
is her brain working?

548
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,200
Probably.
Just not her heart.

549
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,560
She seems like
she's just sleeping.

550
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,240
She's not sleeping.

551
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,160
We double-checked.

552
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,560
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

553
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,560
Her heart? It beat?

554
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,320
No, it's residual
flow from the bypass.

555
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,280
No, I can feel it. Look!

556
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,960
That is her heart, no?

557
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,680
P wave, Q, R, S, T wave.
That's a normal normal.

558
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,640
Esteban?

559
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,440
Marina!

560
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,560
Holy crap.

561
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,320
Is this heaven?

562
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,160
No, it's New Jersey.

563
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,920
God sent you back to me.

564
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,840
It's a miracle.

565
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,720
HOUSE: It's impossible.

566
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,840
CAMERON: Apparently not.

567
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,280
Live hearts don't
stop for no reason.

568
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,640
Dead hearts don't
start for no reason.

569
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,840
Apparently they do.

570
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,720
She's three hours off bypass
and still stable.

571
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
And the pain is gone.

572
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,240
No, it's not.

573
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,920
You think she's lying
about feeling better?

574
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,960
Just because
it's not there now
doesn't mean it's gone.

575
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,200
Just because
it was there before

576
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,400
doesn't mean
it's coming back.

577
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,280
Chase was probably right.

578
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,040
She had some sort
of tropical infection

579
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,560
that cleared when we
put her on antibiotics
during the bypass.

580
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,120
Antibiotics did not
bring her back to life.

581
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,560
Other than a miracle,

582
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,680
it's the only explanation
for her symptoms.

583
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,880
How come God gets credit
whenever something good
happens?

584
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,360
Where was he
when her heart stopped?

585
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,520
What if it wasn't human error?

586
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,880
What if it was God's error?

587
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,120
A congenital defect
in an artery making it
susceptible to inflammation.

588
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,720
We need to do
another angiogram.

589
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,560
We've looked at her
heart 100 different ways.
There was no evidence...

590
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,880
The one time we
looked inside her heart,

591
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,320
we stopped before
we could see anything.

592
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Because it stopped.

593
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,320
Good news.

594
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,480
I think we know
what the problem is.

595
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,000
You mean "was."

596
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,240
Hey, it's my first language,
not yours.

597
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,640
If she
wants to outlive Castro,
we need to fix her heart.

598
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,800
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

599
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,080
In case
no one's filled you in,

600
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,720
today is Monday,
which means you've
been dead for a day.

601
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,600
If that kind of
symptom comes back,
it can get serious.

602
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,440
I need to do
another angiogram.

603
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,440
Wait. Wasn't that what caused
her heart to stop before?

604
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,440
No, God caused that.
He's all-powerful, you know.

605
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,120
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

606
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,560
He was watching
over us in the ocean

607
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,360
and he's watching
over us now.

608
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,840
Your rescuers
didn't have wings,
they had a helicopter.

609
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,880
Esteban prayed.

610
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,720
Do you know
how many little boys
are praying for jetpacks?

611
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,880
How many priests
are praying for...

612
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,920
Well,
that one actually works.

613
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,360
You didn't bring me
back to him.

614
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,840
And I'm not gonna
take you away from him,

615
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,280
but if we don't do
this test, God will.

616
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,480
You said there was no chance,
no hope, which means...

617
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,960
Which means I was wrong.

618
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,600
But I'm wrong all the time.

619
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,760
My mistakes don't
prove there's a God.

620
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,120
You came a long way
to see me.

621
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,560
You gonna put her life
in God's hands or in mine?

622
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,720
Ready?

623
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,360
I better not
see you praying.

624
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,360
I don't want to have
to fight for credit on this.

625
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,800
Exiting the femoral,
entering the aortic arch.

626
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,800
This is where...

627
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,800
Where we stopped to
have a picnic last week.

628
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,400
Her blood pressure's rising!

629
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,720
Mine's rising, too.
Of course, I am doing
battle with a deity.

630
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,440
In the heart.

631
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,040
Injecting the dye.

632
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,520
Right coronary flow
is unobstructed.

633
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,160
Left coronary
flow looks normal.

634
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Looks like you're wrong.

635
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,440
Either I'm right or this test
is about to go very bad.

636
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,800
What's that?

637
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,600
She has one, two,
a third ostium!

638
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,120
<i>How many is she
supposed to have? Dos.</i>

639
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,480
All the third one's doing
is causing inflammation,
throwing off clots,

640
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,200
getting in the way
of the angiogram.

641
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,240
No human would
screw up that big.

642
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,800
Don't worry.

643
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,040
Just one more surgery,
it'll be fine.

644
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,800
Thank God!

645
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,360
Don't make me slap you!

646
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,440
Hi.

647
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,040
It's Tuesday.

648
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,240
No, it's Monday.

649
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,360
I know, I just...

650
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,800
I didn't feel like waiting.

651
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,720
(DOOR OPENING)

652
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,400
I hear you got
another satisfied customer.

653
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,960
One more and I get
a set of steak knives.

654
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,920
Well, this is it.

655
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,880
I appreciate
the opportunity you gave me.

656
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,480
Didn't do it for you.

657
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,400
Thought you were
the best guy for the job.

658
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,720
Thanks, I guess.

659
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,200
Which is why
I want you to stay.

660
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,080
You're an important part
of the team.

661
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,800
I need you.

662
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,960
I know.
But I don't need you.

663
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,880
And I definitely
don't wanna be you.

664
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,960
You're miserable.

665
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,200
I just solved
a case by predicting

666
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,480
a never-before-seen
heart defect.

667
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,080
A case you couldn't solve.

668
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,400
A case you gave up on.

669
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,800
I couldn't be happier.

670
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,120
For two minutes, maybe.

671
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,800
Until the next case
comes along.

672
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,760
Until you're jonesing
for your next fix.

673
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,560
This woman talks while
in full cardiac arrest

674
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,880
and you're more excited
about the talking than
the heart dying!

675
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,040
The two were connected.

676
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,880
I don't wanna solve cases.

677
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,320
I wanna save lives.

678
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,040
Do you think she cares?

679
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,960
Do you think
the husband cares?

680
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,320
You think the children
she can now have

681
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,720
because of me
are gonna care
why I saved her?

682
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,800
I care.
About yourself!

683
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,520
About your own ego!
House.

684
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,920
You're the selfish bastard,
not me,

685
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,600
which is why you took
so much pleasure
in drawing out

686
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
this little goodbye of yours
for the last three weeks.

687
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,440
It wasn't for me,
it wasn't for anyone!

688
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,400
It sure as hell
didn't help anyone!

689
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,720
Nice try.

690
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,280
Nice tries are worthless.

691
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,240
You now have
a bigger office than I do.

692
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,880
Why don't you go enjoy it?

693
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,800
Better be naked pictures.

694
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,680
My resignation letter.

695
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,240
I've gotten
all I can from this job.

696
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
What do you expect me to do?

697
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,000
Break down and apologize?
Beg Chase to come back?

698
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,280
No.

699
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
I expect you to do
what you always do.

700
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,200
I expect you to
make a joke and go on.

701
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,080
I expect you to be just fine.

702
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,760
I'll miss you.

703
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,400
Genuine American cigars.

704
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,440
You guys can't
get them in Cuba.

705
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,960
100% healthy.

706
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,800
Shouldn't you go home?

707
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,480
Patient follow-up.
Very important.

708
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,240
She looks great.
I think she's sleeping.

709
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,600
She is sleeping,
I double-check.

710
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,960
So, they all quit?

711
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,360
Two of them quit.
I fired the third.

712
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,200
It must be very hard
to lose your people.

713
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,400
You must be very upset.

714
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,320
Yeah, I must be.

715
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,120
But you're not?

716
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,760
I don't think I am.

717
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,040
I think I'm okay.

718
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,480
What are you going to do?

719
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,040
God only knows.
