(AMUSEMENT PARK MUSIC PLAYING)

2
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:12,070
All right. Stand here.

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,655
You're just tall enough.

4
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,159
I...

5
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:19,326
I don't...

6
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:21,245
I don't think I am.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,538
It just goes around.

8
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:23,914
There's nothing to be
scared of, all right?

9
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:25,707
I didn't say I was scared.

10
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:26,750
It'll be fun.

11
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,419
Come on, when I was a kid,
this was
my favorite thing ever.

12
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,171
I don't like rides.

13
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:34,132
All right. All right.

14
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:36,467
(STUTTERING)
I just...
I thought it would be fun.

15
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:38,177
I shouldn't be
making you do this.

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,220
Uh...

17
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:42,181
Let's go home.
We can have fun at home.

18
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:44,016
No, Daddy. Wait.

19
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:52,148
The ride does look like fun.

20
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:04,493
Oh, this is awesome.

21
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,503
(SCREAMING LOUDLY)

00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,927
MR. HARTMANN:
Alice? Are you all right?

23
00:01:24,928 --> 00:01:26,555
Honey, you all right?

24
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:30,475
Alice? Alice? Are you okay?

25
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:05,173
MR. HARTMANN:
Nothing happened.

26
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:06,383
EDIE: Something happened.

27
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,467
It was a little kiddie ride.

28
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:08,468
She hates those rides.

29
00:02:08,552 --> 00:02:09,970
I don't understand
why you insist on
making her...

30
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:12,597
Okay, I appreciate
the fullness of your answers,

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,307
but I just wanted
to know if she'd had

32
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:16,142
any history of
abdominal problems.

33
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:17,310
No.
No.

34
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:20,521
The admitting doctor noted
no family history of...

35
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:22,272
I have an aunt
with Crohn's disease.

36
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:24,066
You didn't mention that?

37
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:25,317
I forgot what it
was called, okay?

38
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:27,444
Your aunt's got
a million things
wrong with her.

39
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:28,945
If you paid attention
for five minutes...

40
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:30,739
I doubt it's Crohn's.
She has none of
the other symptoms.

41
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:33,616
You're alone with
her for eight hours,
she ends up in the hospital.

42
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:35,368
I'm wondering if
we can focus on

43
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,161
answering the questions,
Mrs. Hartmann.

44
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:39,705
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann.
We're divorced.

45
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:42,583
I suspected.

46
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:47,254
And your past generosity
made me think of you.

47
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:49,547
We're half a million dollars
from our goal.

48
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:53,176
Of course,
this is a naming opportunity
for your foundation.

49
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:57,805
Is there a problem?

50
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:00,933
There's something
on your face.

51
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:04,561
It's, uh...

52
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:05,937
(CLEARING HER THROAT)

53
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:11,067
Excuse me.
Oh...

54
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:12,110
CUDDY: Oh, God.

55
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,866
I'm sitting in there
hoping it's a sniper,

56
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,077
because at least then
the sociopath isn't
my employee.

57
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,163
This baby won me second place
in the clinic's weekly

58
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,374
"weirdest thing pulled out
of an orifice" contest.

59
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,418
I am this close
to putting a new lab
in Oncology.

60
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,545
You do not want
to know what came in first.

61
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,713
House.

62
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,964
It rhymes with fucchini.

63
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,966
Give me his pills.

64
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,138
Where's my prescription?

65
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:44,514
No more
free-floating prescriptions.

66
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,642
Princeton P.D.
Has already forced
Wilson to shut down.

67
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:50,020
A cop says,
"Boo," Wilson shuts down.

68
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,355
Every doctor in
this place is afraid

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,732
to make a move
without covering his ass.

70
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:57,234
You think maybe
you're shouting
at the wrong person?

71
00:03:57,318 --> 00:03:59,195
Tritter's obviously
out to get me.
He doesn't...

72
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:00,446
You forged prescriptions!

73
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:01,447
Allegedly.

74
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,491
Your pain has become my pain.

75
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:07,744
From now on,
you get reasonable doses
at reasonable times.

76
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:09,704
But I hurt in
an unreasonable way.

77
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:10,955
Then dip into
your secret stash.

78
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,207
Tritter took it.

79
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:13,875
Then move on to your secret,
secret stash.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,251
I ran out.

81
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:17,586
Then move on to your secret,
secret, secret stash.

82
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,015
Parents say she's
not on any meds.

83
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,851
If the pancreatitis
wasn't set off by drugs,
and she hasn't been sick,

84
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,521
that leaves trauma
or some kind of
structural defect.

85
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:38,064
Put up the CT.

86
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:41,317
What's that density there?

87
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:43,402
Shadow.
Looks normal to me.

88
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:45,404
We got
a referral from...

89
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:46,780
HOUSE: Excuse me.

90
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,994
You stash your drugs
in a lupus textbook?

91
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,454
It's never lupus.

92
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:55,955
Who's got gallstones,
and why do we care?

93
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:57,331
Gallstones?

94
00:04:57,373 --> 00:05:00,459
Biliary duct is dilated,
probably from
a stone lodged in it.

95
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,252
Must've caused a nasty
case of pancreatitis.

96
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,588
She's six. Six-year-olds
don't get gallstones.

97
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,465
So, she didn't
have pancreatitis?

98
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,383
Your theory is
an invisible gallstone?

99
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:10,969
His theory correctly
predicted pancreatitis.

100
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:13,263
You might want to wait until
he actually
tells us his theory

101
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,181
before you start
kissing his theory's ass.

102
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,058
My theory is...

103
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:18,851
Vanishing gallstone.

104
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:20,978
She had it and it passed.

105
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,312
Those things travel
in packs.

106
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:23,897
The rest of them are
probably hiding out

107
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,440
in her gallbladder.
Do an ultrasound.

108
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:28,735
If I'm right,
take out the organ,
so we can analyze the stones.

109
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,576
CHASE: I wasn't
kissing his ass.

110
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,453
FOREMAN: It must have
just looked that way
from our angle,

111
00:05:39,495 --> 00:05:41,497
you on your knees,
House bending over.

112
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,332
He predicted
the pancreatitis.

113
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,416
It's his dad's fault.

114
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,626
My dad was an ass.

115
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:47,210
But you did
everything he wanted you to,

116
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:49,045
and in return,
you got
everything you wanted.

117
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:50,630
Yeah, it's that simple.

118
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:51,923
The strategy worked.

119
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:55,009
Dad got him a cushy job,
paid for his cushy life.

120
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:57,219
Cut me out
of his cushy will.

121
00:05:57,678 --> 00:06:00,389
Told you.
It's just his nature.

122
00:06:00,723 --> 00:06:02,516
Poor guy's
hard-wired to kiss ass.

123
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:05,018
House was right.
Gallstones.

124
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:09,356
I didn't know a kid
could get gallstones.

125
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,024
It's unusual.

126
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:12,734
That's why we need to
see what's causing it.

127
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:15,778
We'd like to remove
Alice's gallbladder
and analyze the stones.

128
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,904
Sure.
No.

129
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:17,989
Just 'cause I said sure?

130
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:19,115
I am capable of
my own thoughts.

131
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:20,241
It's a simple procedure.

132
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,367
The gallbladder
isn't essential to...

133
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,409
The doctor thinks
we should do it.

134
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:23,410
We should do it, Edie.

135
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:24,786
You think maybe we should
get a second opinion

136
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:27,664
before we start removing
our child's organs?

137
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:41,302
It's an effective use
of taxpayer's money.

138
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:43,220
I'm actually off this week.

139
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,764
I'm guessing
you don't have a family.

140
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,516
Most people have
enough going on
in their lives

141
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,893
that they don't have
to personalize every slight.

142
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:51,644
This isn't personal.

143
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:53,229
Not anymore.

144
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,273
My head of Oncology
had to shut down.

145
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:59,068
My entire staff are
afraid to make a move
without covering their ass.

146
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,904
I think you're angry
at the wrong person.

147
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,699
You think Dr. Wilson deserved
to have his assets seized,

148
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:07,659
his entire practice ruined?

149
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:08,827
No.

150
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,787
So, you just don't care?

151
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:15,458
This is how I get
what I want.

152
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,503
I put pressure on people,
and if it doesn't work
on Wilson,

153
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:22,673
it'll work on you.

154
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,384
You punish the innocent.

155
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,427
None of you are innocent.

156
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:29,012
Not one of you.

157
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:32,515
Not one of you has
told me the truth
about Dr. House.

158
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,143
The pills allow him
to cope with the pain.

159
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:39,897
No. The pills distort reality.
He is an addict.

160
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,816
He's not out robbing
a liquor store, or...

161
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,109
No, he's treating people.

162
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:49,281
He needs to find
a different way to cope
before he kills somebody.

163
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:50,990
If he hasn't
done that already.

164
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:53,701
If you're right,
he has a medical problem.

165
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:56,329
It should be dealt with
by doctors.

166
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:57,413
Not by...

167
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:58,414
It's not being
dealt with by doctors.

168
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:01,000
Doctors are covering it up.

169
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:06,671
The whole point
of the criminal
justice system

170
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:09,883
is to make things right
when everything else fails.

171
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,177
With all due respect,

172
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,304
you have failed.

173
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,692
Sorry, didn't know
you wanted your kid dead.

174
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,903
Although, for a couple of G's,
I can still make it happen.

175
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:32,904
Who the hell are you?

176
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,364
I am a complete stranger,

177
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:36,824
who apparently cares more
about whether your kid dies
than you do.

178
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:37,950
You're Dr. House.

179
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,577
You've seen my stage show.

180
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,121
She's not dying.
She has pancreatitis.

181
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:43,956
Once you've treated that,
I'm taking her home.

182
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:45,290
And do what, burn sage?

183
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:46,625
I want you
to do the surgery.

184
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,876
My father had gallstones.

185
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,252
They were totally harmless.

186
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:50,712
Alice had one bad one,
but it passed.

187
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:52,255
For all we know,
this is over.

188
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:54,090
And for all we know,
she could get
sick again tomorrow.

189
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:55,550
Then I'll take her
to her pediatrician.

190
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:57,134
She's six, Rob.

191
00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:58,886
She shouldn't have
unnecessary surgery.

192
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,639
Or a moron for a mom,
but what can you do?

193
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:05,017
You're the doctor.
I'm the mother.

194
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,853
I outrank you.
Live with it.

195
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:15,526
I've read the file.
You've got 15 minutes.

196
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,195
It's people like this
who killed Copernicus.

197
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,280
Galileo.

198
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:20,489
Either way.

199
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:21,740
And they just
locked Galileo up.

200
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:24,785
They killed his spirit,
and nobody likes a show-off.

201
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,370
Luckily, Alice Hartmann
has a dad who's willing
to see reason.

202
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:30,373
Reason, as defined by
slavishly deferring to you.

203
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:31,541
Their doctor.

204
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,834
Your Honor,
I've had no opportunity

205
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:33,960
to consult my attorney.

206
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:35,211
There's no time.

207
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:36,754
All I want is
a second opinion before...

208
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,381
No time.

209
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:40,841
Your testimony is
their child will die

210
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,177
if I don't grant
this motion right now?

211
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,469
Am I under oath?

212
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:45,971
Let's say yes.

213
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:48,014
My testimony is
that this child

214
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:50,058
might die if you
don't grant this motion
right now.

215
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,018
Literally no time
for a second opinion?

216
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,686
Wouldn't be as good
as the first opinion.

217
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,812
Dr. Cuddy,
what do you think?

218
00:09:54,896 --> 00:09:56,522
She's not
a specialist in this area.

219
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:58,315
Her opinion is worthless.

220
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,110
Dr. Cuddy, what do
you think of Dr. House?

221
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,695
Is he as big a jerk
as I think he is?

222
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,905
Bigger.

223
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,699
But he knows what
he's talking about.

224
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:35,933
Got a page.

225
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:37,310
She's complaining
about her stitches.

226
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:39,145
The nurse just said
that's completely normal.

227
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:40,896
Did you get the test results
for the gallstones?

228
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,939
Any minute now.

229
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,857
No time for a second opinion,
but the test takes three...

230
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,359
My skin hurts.

231
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,195
I know I no longer
have the right

232
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,612
to demand it but could
you please take a look?

233
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:50,697
Sure.

234
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,657
She's pissed,
so now she's just looking
for things to go wrong.

235
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,994
You're right, I'm so petty
I hope she dies so it
vindicates my opinion.

236
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:01,582
I didn't mean that, sweetie.

237
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:03,167
Mommy was being sarcastic.

238
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,836
She's a few years away
from grasping sarcasm,
don't you think?

239
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,962
Guys.

240
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:21,517
I already gave
you that number.

241
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,770
<i>Simple surgical procedure
turns a little girl
into The English Patient.</i>

242
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:25,812
What gives?

243
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:28,106
Must be allergic
to something we used
in the surgery.

244
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,482
Cameron,

245
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,734
C-A-M-E-R-O-N.

246
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:33,444
This is my office.
I'm talking.

247
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,238
There are people
here who work for me.

248
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,073
They're not listening.
Explain this to me.

249
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,699
Tritter froze my account.

250
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,201
They're checking theirs.

251
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:41,785
I'm on hold with a lawyer.

252
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,870
Call Wilson's lawyer.

253
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,997
He'll tell you exactly how
and why you're screwed.

254
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,373
This kid has no
history of allergies so...

255
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,916
You gotta talk to Tritter.

256
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,959
You gotta make this go away.

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,251
CHASE: Yeah, great plan.

258
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,753
The man is obviously
open to reason.

259
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,838
Well, here's the plan,
we do nothing.

260
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,716
HOUSE: We while away the time
diagnosing the patient.

261
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,967
The stones were
calcium bilirubinate.

262
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,343
Pigment stones.

263
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,803
Which are non-conclusive.

264
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:04,014
Kid presented
with low-grade fever,
mild anemia.

265
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,391
That, plus the stones,
indicates bacterial infection.

266
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,477
Bacterial infections
don't cause a vesicular rash,

267
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,729
and doing nothing
is not a plan.

268
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:13,356
It's specifically
a lack of a plan.

269
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,525
We cut into her belly,
the bad boys escape.

270
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:20,446
They swarm over,
colonize the wounds,
and kaplow, vesicular rash.

271
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,615
Allergic reaction is
100 times more likely,
with or without a history.

272
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,077
Fever and anemia
could have been
symptoms of pancreatitis.

273
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,203
Hello?

274
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:31,289
CAMERON: Thank you
for your help.

275
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:32,832
They froze my accounts.

276
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,125
"Thank you for your help"?

277
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,710
It's not her fault.

278
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:37,211
He hasn't gotten
to mine, yet.

279
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:39,338
I'm gonna withdraw
as much as I can,
as fast as I can.

280
00:12:39,421 --> 00:12:40,839
Lunch is on me.

281
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:43,258
Do a scratch test.
Check for allergies.

282
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:47,012
When it comes back negative,
start broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

283
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:50,265
Bullies bully.

284
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,141
They don't get a reaction,
they lose interest.

285
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:56,479
Now go do what I ask
before I stick
your heads in toilets.

286
00:13:02,943 --> 00:13:04,194
How'd Otter get here?

287
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:06,154
Daddy got him last night.

288
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:07,572
It was at the dry cleaner.
They close at 6:00.

289
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:09,032
How'd you get it?

290
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:10,200
I drove over there,

291
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:14,370
and I knocked for
about 10 minutes,
and then I begged.

292
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:24,171
How about some ice cream
for when this is through?

293
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:25,714
My tummy hurts.

294
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:27,382
Ginger ale?

295
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,175
Yeah?

296
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:30,927
I'll take over.

297
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:32,428
Be right back.

298
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,311
He's always been really good
at the big romantic gestures,

299
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:45,482
but ask him to do the dishes,
or show up for a meal
on time, or drive her...

300
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:47,150
Almost done here.

301
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,334
What are you doing here?

302
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,334
I work here.

303
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:08,753
You passively-aggressively
gave up your practice.

304
00:14:08,837 --> 00:14:09,879
I have clinic hours.

305
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:12,799
And now you're
passively-aggressively
spreading peanut butter

306
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:14,384
with a big sign
around your neck saying,

307
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:16,594
"Wilson doesn't
have enough cash
for the cafeteria."

308
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:19,305
You know,
before Lenny Bruce died
of a drug overdose...

309
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:20,639
(EXCLAIMING)

310
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:22,349
If you're going
to confront me

311
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:24,226
with everyone who
ever abused narcotics,

312
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:25,686
I think I'm gonna have to get
something to read.

313
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:27,437
...he was arrested
on obscenity charges.

314
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,397
He went through
a series of arrests
and trials,

315
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:31,483
because he just couldn't
stop challenging the police.

316
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,943
He became obsessed
with his own legal problems,

317
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:36,737
and his act turned into long,
humorless rants

318
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,532
about fascist cops and
the violation of his rights.

319
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,866
I get it, I get it.

320
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,201
I need to change
my nightclub act.

321
00:14:42,284 --> 00:14:43,660
You think more props?

322
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:47,164
House, scratch test
is getting results,
a lot of results.

323
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,056
MR. HARTMANN: How can she be
allergic to everything?

324
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,516
She can't be.

325
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,517
It has to be an infection.

326
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,520
You see
a positive allergy test
and decide it's infection?

327
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:14,856
The bacteria got
into the scratches
in her back.

328
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,274
The infection's radial.

329
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:18,192
The shape of this isn't.
Eat this.

330
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:19,276
I don't feel like eating.

331
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,402
It'll make you better.

332
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:21,445
A sandwich?

333
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:22,488
Magic sandwich.

334
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,323
There's no such thing as...

335
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,241
Just take a damn bite,
okay, kid?

336
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:45,384
Amazing how she
didn't go into
anaphylactic shock.

337
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,052
That's
diagnostically ridiculous.

338
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:49,387
Right, she's allergic
to everything except peanuts.

339
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:53,099
If she is allergic,
antibiotics could cause
a massive systemic reaction.

340
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:55,518
If she's allergic,
but she's not.

341
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:58,020
FOREMAN: Chase, you're right.

342
00:15:58,104 --> 00:15:59,355
The shape indicates allergy.

343
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:00,773
The tests indicate allergy.

344
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:02,483
Just because she's
not allergic to peanuts,

345
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:04,401
doesn't mean
she's not allergic
to lidocaine or...

346
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:06,153
Chase, hang the bag.

347
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:08,530
You can grow
a backbone tomorrow.

348
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:09,948
No, I'm not giving
my daughter drugs

349
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:11,533
that could shut
her system down.

350
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:13,910
You know what else
shuts down systems?

351
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:15,119
Death.

352
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:17,913
Sorry. I can't let you
do this.

353
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,922
Luckily,
Alice Hartmann has a mom,
who is willing to see reason.

354
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:29,591
You were in here yesterday,
telling me

355
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:31,968
her father's guardianship
was best for her.

356
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,929
I honestly figured I'd get
a different judge today.

357
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,722
You agree with Dr. House now?

358
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,849
Now my kid actually is sick.

359
00:16:38,891 --> 00:16:39,975
She was sick yesterday.

360
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:41,352
Her pediatrician
doesn't know what's wrong

361
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:42,811
with her,
says Dr. House is the best.

362
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:44,855
She loses guardianship,
and all of a sudden
House is a hero.

363
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:46,023
It's got nothing to
do with me deciding...

364
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:47,274
JUDGE: Hey, zip it!

365
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:48,525
I've heard enough.

366
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,609
This lawyering thing is easy.

367
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:50,693
You shut up, too.

368
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:54,989
Arguing over every decision
is a waste of her time
and mine.

369
00:16:56,157 --> 00:16:58,909
Since her parents can't,
or won't, agree,

370
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,080
I'm awarding
temporary guardianship
to a doctor,

371
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:06,583
who'll place
the health of the child
above all else...

372
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,667
I don't think Dr. House
is capable of...

373
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:08,835
...Dr. Cuddy.

374
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,378
Yes, Your Honor.

375
00:17:10,545 --> 00:17:12,046
No, I was finishing
my sentence.

376
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,841
The kid's all yours.

377
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,345
<i>HOUSE.: 3.:00, give me
the pills.</i>

378
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,512
I don't even know this kid.

379
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:22,431
How am I supposed to decide
what's best for her?

380
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:23,557
Fine, I'll choose.

381
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,434
I'm going to side with
the angry doctor's opinion.

382
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:26,560
Give me my pills.

383
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:27,978
We're not gonna
go broad-spectrum.

384
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,229
If there's any chance
that she's allergic...

385
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,230
There is no chance.

386
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:32,106
Of course there's a chance.
I'm appealing.

387
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,274
No, you're not.

388
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:34,984
If you think it's bacterial,
pick one antibiotic.

389
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:35,985
It's not going to be enough.

390
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:37,945
We need to go broad-spectrum.

391
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:39,989
It kills bugs.
That's what you want.

392
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,074
We'll go with metronidazole.

393
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:48,413
<i>TRITTER.: You don't have to
testify he's broken any laws,</i>

394
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:50,331
though I'm sure you could.

395
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:52,250
Just how many pills
he takes in a day.

396
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,003
'Cause I'm fairly confident
I can prove that he didn't

397
00:17:56,504 --> 00:17:59,381
have that many
legitimate prescriptions.

398
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:03,719
I really hope no one dies
while I'm sitting
here not talking to you.

399
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:06,013
I, uh, I had a, uh...

400
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:10,100
Had a buddy at Trenton P.D.

401
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:12,685
Do some digging.

402
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:15,146
Your brother,
locked up for drugs.

403
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:18,899
Your own flesh and blood,
and you don't even visit.

404
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:22,319
But your boss
practices medicine on drugs,

405
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:26,114
time to start
lying to the cops.

406
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:30,285
If I run out for coffee,
will I get back
before you make your point?

407
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,829
You testify,

408
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,583
I can make sure
that Marcus
goes free on parole

409
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:41,003
in less than two months.

410
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:45,007
My brother and I, uh...

411
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,010
We grew up in the same home.

412
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:51,846
But...

413
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:55,099
I made something of myself.

414
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:57,226
He didn't.

415
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,854
Dr. Foreman,
the way you talk,

416
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:03,065
you'd think
you never committed
any crimes yourself.

417
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:07,611
Now, you and Dr. House,
you are both cold bastards.

418
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:12,031
You don't give a damn
about your brother,
and you can't stand House.

419
00:19:14,617 --> 00:19:18,996
But I do expect you
to take this deal,

420
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:22,624
because you hate
hypocrisy more.

421
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,835
House has had 1,000 chances.

422
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,586
You've got two chances.

423
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:29,381
Why is your brother
stuck at one?

424
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:39,223
CUDDY: Well, if she were
allergic to this antibiotic,
we would have seen it by now.

425
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:42,476
I think we are
out of the woods
as far as that goes.

426
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:45,395
Guess they occasionally
get one right.

427
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:47,522
You're going to
be glib about this?

428
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:48,565
You almost killed her.

429
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:49,607
I made a choice.

430
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:50,942
The same choice
you made yesterday,

431
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,318
only when I make
it I'm an imbecile.

432
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,195
Every decision you have made
has been wrong.

433
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,113
When this is over,
I'm suing for sole custody.

434
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:58,240
Because I trusted
doctors when you didn't?

435
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,743
Because it's not just about
the past two days.

436
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,412
MR. HARTMANN: Like you have
the hotline on what's best
for Alice. She loves me.

437
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,122
EDIE: She never does
her homework
when she's with you.

438
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,248
She never brushes her hair.

439
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,083
Her heart's racing,
pressure's rising.

440
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,001
The two of you get out.

441
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,254
I'm her mother.
You can't just...

442
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,465
You fight,
she has an anxiety attack.

443
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,758
The two of you are
making her worse.

444
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,885
Get out, and don't come back.

445
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,684
How's the kid doing?

446
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,311
Much better as of
about two hours ago.

447
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,937
You got any money for lunch?

448
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,814
If you like
parsley and croutons.

449
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,732
Tritter finally
froze my accounts.

450
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,733
Really?

451
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,859
You surprised?
Why wouldn't he?

452
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,444
I figured if he
was singling you out,

453
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:40,154
you must have done
something different.

454
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,822
What? Like talking?
Yeah.

455
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:44,449
And now that he's
frozen your accounts,
you probably will.

456
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:45,826
You need the cash, right?

457
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,869
He doesn't freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

458
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:49,996
He does freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

459
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:51,873
Is Alice having
some procedure done?

460
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:53,124
She's fine. She's resting.

461
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:54,292
Where?
In her room.

462
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,043
Where you're not supposed...
I was just at the window.

463
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:57,336
There's no one in there.

464
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,754
Her backpack
wasn't there, either.

465
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:00,548
You don't think her
father could have...

466
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:02,049
Call Security.

467
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:13,226
Get a gurney.

468
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:14,936
MR. HARTMANN:
She's stiff. She can't move.

469
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:16,312
I don't know what happened.

470
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:17,772
She seemed fine.

471
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:21,233
Help her. Please.

472
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:31,576
On the plus side,
she could medal in luge.

473
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:34,412
Muscle rigidity
is almost
exclusively neurological.

474
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,539
Neuroaxonal dystrophy?
She's the right age.

475
00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:38,249
CHASE: Except that her liver's
starting to shut down.

476
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:39,333
No dystrophy would...

477
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,627
Metronidazole, great idea.

478
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,003
"Let's not go broad-spectrum.

479
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:44,963
"Let's not take any chances
on actually curing her."

480
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:46,506
House, can you focus
on the case?

481
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,592
No, because I'm in pain,

482
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,802
'cause you think
that compromise
is the answer to everything.

483
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:51,970
I need more pills.

484
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:54,430
Muscle rigidity
plus liver involvement
means Wilson's.

485
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,891
No. No corneal rings,
no mental changes.

486
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,309
CAMERON: Then what?

487
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,438
I need more pills!

488
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,440
No! You are
on a reasonable...

489
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,068
What the hell does
"reasonable" mean?

490
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:14,240
Keep it quiet.

491
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:16,784
Her BP reacts to stress
and yelling is not...

492
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:21,205
If you think that
I'm not in pain,
then don't give me anything.

493
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:22,706
Keep me away
from the aspirin,

494
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:25,167
but if I'm in
a butt-load of pain,
I need a butt-load of pills.

495
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,668
Fine. You need more pills.

496
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:28,336
You're not getting them.

497
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,922
You can have all
the aspirin you want.

498
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,637
FOREMAN: I say we draw straws.

499
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:42,266
Loser drives down to Trenton
and scores him an eight ball.

500
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:46,186
Which one of you two
gave her an aspirin?

501
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:48,063
What?
Her symptoms fit
Reye's Syndrome.

502
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:50,607
Which doesn't make any sense,
unless she took aspirin.

503
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,941
Rob?
No way. She's a kid.

504
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,401
I've read
the 800 warning labels.

505
00:22:53,443 --> 00:22:54,402
I'm not even angry.

506
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:55,444
I just want her to be okay.

507
00:22:55,486 --> 00:22:56,696
HOUSE: She's lying.

508
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:57,988
She's angry,
'cause you kidnapped her kid.

509
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,740
She'll be angrier
if the kid dies.

510
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:01,283
I didn't.
One aspirin

511
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:02,743
combined with
a pre-existing infection,

512
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:04,244
that's all it takes
to set off an attack.

513
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:05,370
I'm not lying.

514
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:07,914
Well, sure, you've
certainly earned our trust.

515
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:09,874
Where was Alice
the night before she came in?

516
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,835
With me. Well, at my house.

517
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,878
I went out.
She stayed
with the babysitter.

518
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,338
Where were you?
None of your business.

519
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:17,173
You hired someone
that might have
poisoned our daughter.

520
00:23:17,256 --> 00:23:20,342
She's 15.
She's very responsible.

521
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:21,927
Is she a 15-year-old
pharmacist?

522
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,262
Or just some kid
from down the street

523
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:24,596
who needed 20 bucks
for lip gloss

524
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,723
<i>and a couple of Tiger Beats?</i>

525
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,435
Put your kid
on charcoal hemoperfusion.

526
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:32,103
Shouldn't we see
what the babysitter
has to say?

527
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,438
I know what she's gonna say.

528
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:34,897
She's gonna lie
to save her business.

529
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,566
I need more pills.

530
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:45,991
We are going
to use this machine
to clean your blood.

531
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,118
It goes out of you
and through a filter,

532
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:50,328
like the filter
in a fish tank.

533
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:53,206
It's kind of cool, actually.

534
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:58,919
I'm scared.

535
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:03,715
It won't hurt.

536
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,345
It takes a while,
so it'll be boring,
but it won't hurt.

537
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:12,181
It's going to
make you better.

538
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:16,519
They hate each other,
don't they?

539
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:19,146
We're never going
to be together again.

540
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:23,066
Well, you never know.

541
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:34,202
You're going to break
out the rubber hoses,
the bright lights?

542
00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:36,912
I'm not going to testify
just because I have
to borrow lunch money.

543
00:24:36,954 --> 00:24:41,583
I know.
Women don't give up guys
that they're in love with.

544
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:43,752
I'm not in love with House.

545
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:46,922
The guy is
unhinged and unethical,

546
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:49,466
does what he wants
with no concern for others,

547
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:51,009
but you stand by him.

548
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,261
It can't just be
loyalty and respect?

549
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:55,012
No.

550
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:56,764
I'm a girl, so I must
be in love with him.

551
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:58,766
Not because you're a girl.

552
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:01,143
Because 10 years ago

553
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:04,730
you got an A in calculus,
until you ratted yourself out.

554
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:09,567
Showed your professor
a mistake he missed.

555
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,861
Because you married a man...

556
00:25:11,986 --> 00:25:13,363
Don't go there.

557
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,949
You used to be someone
who did the right thing.

558
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:20,703
House has changed you.

559
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:24,957
Do you think it's all
been for the better?

560
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:36,842
How's it going?

561
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:37,968
Boring.

562
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:39,428
Told you.
FOREMAN: So far so good.

563
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:42,139
Just like five minutes ago,
and 10 minutes before that.

564
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:43,849
What's the matter?

565
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:45,350
(WHIMPERING)

566
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:48,186
(YELLING)

567
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,981
She's thrown a clot.

568
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:53,399
Let's get her out of here.
I'll call the OR.

569
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:56,444
You said it wouldn't hurt.

570
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:57,862
(YELLING)

571
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:07,579
Found it.
She's burning up.

572
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:08,663
Give me a sec.

573
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,873
Foreman, she is on fire.

574
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:10,915
Almost there.

575
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,208
Get me some
cooling blankets now.

576
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,584
Right away.

577
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:15,503
Every time we touch this kid,
something goes wrong.

578
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:17,797
Bad mojo is not a diagnosis.

579
00:26:18,297 --> 00:26:21,884
You really have to
flash your private stash
in front of me?

580
00:26:22,176 --> 00:26:24,845
You find it
easier to lie for me
if it's more subtle?

581
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:25,887
Fine.

582
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:34,395
You told your associates
that I had
frozen your accounts.

583
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:35,521
Yes.

584
00:26:35,563 --> 00:26:36,814
Smart lie.

585
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:40,818
You figured they'd
think there was a reason
that you'd been singled out.

586
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:44,529
Like that you'd agreed
to testify against House.

587
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:47,532
Yeah, I assume
that's why you did it.

588
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:52,954
You have a reputation
as a bit of an opportunist.

589
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:55,081
You already gave
your boss up once
from what I heard.

590
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:56,624
To save my job.

591
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,250
He goes down now,
I lose my job.

592
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:00,211
You lose your job,
you find another one.

593
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,754
You get fired,

594
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,631
your chances
don't look so hot.

595
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:05,924
Why would he fire me?

596
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:07,134
Because you rolled on him.

597
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:08,551
I haven't rolled on him.

598
00:27:08,718 --> 00:27:10,011
I think you will.

599
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,804
And he's gonna
think you already did.

600
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:13,097
As far as he knows,

601
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:16,058
my accounts are frozen
just like everyone else's.

602
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,020
In 24 hours, all three
of you will have access
to your accounts again.

603
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:21,730
Why would you do...

604
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:26,193
If I was looking
at this as an outsider,

605
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,528
I would say

606
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:30,822
it was because
Detective Tritter had

607
00:27:30,905 --> 00:27:34,283
what appeared to be
a very pleasant lunch
with Dr. Chase.

608
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:37,953
(TRITTER CHUCKLING)

609
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:41,290
(SIGHING)

610
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,041
Yeah.

611
00:27:45,752 --> 00:27:50,048
The two of them appear
to be working together.

612
00:27:56,554 --> 00:27:58,431
CUDDY: How the hell are
there no ice packs
in the OR?

613
00:27:58,514 --> 00:27:59,557
Clot's out.

614
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:00,599
Ice packs aren't
gonna hold it for long.

615
00:28:00,683 --> 00:28:01,600
FOREMAN:
Where are the blankets?

616
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:02,935
CUDDY: In the ER.

617
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:04,228
They're dealing with
a four-car collision.

618
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:07,606
We need to cool this kid down
before her brain melts.

619
00:28:10,984 --> 00:28:12,694
What are you doing?

620
00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:15,571
She got a major
dose of heparin

621
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:16,864
to thin her blood
for the procedure.

622
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:18,616
Could have induced
thrombocytopenia.

623
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:19,909
That's unlikely.

624
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,619
The charcoal
would have absorbed
a lot of the heparin.

625
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,121
She's been anemic.

626
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:25,747
Could be
a primary blood disorder.

627
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,582
Or we never
cured the infection.

628
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,125
Are you saying
she never had Reye's?

629
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,419
We just put that
little girl through
excruciating pain.

630
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,587
The pain wasn't
House's fault.

631
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,796
Even if
the clot was a reaction

632
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,006
to what we gave her,
we still had to...

633
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,383
I don't need you
to cover my ass!

634
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,468
What I need is my Vicodin!

635
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,679
Two pills every six hours,
like I'm on an allowance.

636
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,474
She's giving a cop leverage
over medical decisions.

637
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,142
What the hell?
Why don't we get

638
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,935
a plumber in here,
ask his opinion?

639
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,689
Hey, Cuddy,
you know any rodeo clowns
who can weigh in...

640
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,235
Where the hell is she?

641
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:05,492
Look at her arm.

642
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:08,203
I told you it
was an infection.

643
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:09,496
We fixed the infection.

644
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:10,747
Well, apparently not.

645
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,956
I asked you for
broad-spectrum.

646
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:13,291
You put her on
the bare minimum.

647
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:17,420
It's a good thing you failed
to become a mom,
because you suck at it.

648
00:29:34,644 --> 00:29:36,687
What's so good
about this rash?

649
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:43,944
Good guesses, but no.

650
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:47,531
It's on parts of her body
that we haven't touched.

651
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:50,992
She's got a fever of 103.
She's in and out
of consciousness,

652
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:53,077
but it's not
a reaction to anything we did.

653
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:54,829
Our mojo is off the table.

654
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:56,289
Which means...

655
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,750
Oh, so close.

656
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:03,253
Means thanks to Cuddy's
candy-ass approach,

657
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:06,465
broad-spectrum antibiotics
are no longer an option.

658
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:09,301
This thing has
grown horns and fangs.

659
00:30:09,718 --> 00:30:11,845
We've gotta figure
out what species it is,

660
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,138
go in with a spear
to the heart.

661
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,184
Okay, you guys are sulking.

662
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:20,144
I don't really care why,
but apparently

663
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:22,187
I can't do my job
without finding out.

664
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,689
Tritter released
our bank accounts.

665
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:26,024
Horrible, horrible news.

666
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,526
Wow, I'm glad we didn't
let that fester.

667
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,028
If she did have Reye's,
then it could

668
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,654
be varicella.
They're associated.

669
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:32,947
He released our money.

670
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:34,323
You do know what that means?

671
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:36,284
The correct question is,

672
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,786
how could it be varicella
given that she's not itchy?

673
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,038
Rickettsial pox causes rash,
fever and muscle pain.

674
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:42,498
CAMERON: Pain, not paralysis.

675
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,249
Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
on the other hand,

676
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,001
rash, fever,
anemia, paralysis.

677
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,294
And I didn't say
anything to Tritter.

678
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,628
Neither did I.

679
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:51,339
Maybe he wants us to think
that one of us talked.

680
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:52,924
It worked.
You were with him.

681
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:54,008
We were all with him.

682
00:30:54,092 --> 00:30:55,593
We weren't laughing with him.

683
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:57,219
Maybe he just gave up.

684
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:59,180
Start the kid on
chloramphenicol

685
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:01,181
for Rocky Mountain
spotted fever.

686
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:04,893
Can we talk?

687
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:06,853
No.
I really think we...

688
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:07,854
Either you screwed me

689
00:31:07,938 --> 00:31:10,482
and you want absolution,
or you didn't and
you want applause.

690
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,775
Either way,
I'm not interested.

691
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:25,996
I'm busy.

692
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:30,792
You okay?

693
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:31,834
Yeah, sure.

694
00:31:31,918 --> 00:31:33,961
What I meant by
"Are you okay?"

695
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:36,130
Is "What
the hell did House do?"

696
00:31:36,255 --> 00:31:38,090
Nothing.
What did he say?

697
00:31:38,174 --> 00:31:41,969
I've seen House be rude
1,000 times,
usually to achieve something.

698
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:45,555
I have never seen him be mean
just because he can.

699
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,390
Seriously?

700
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:51,478
What did he say?

701
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:52,770
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

702
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:55,815
Well, I've seen
House be rude to you
1,000 times,

703
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:57,191
but I've never seen it
get to you.

704
00:31:57,274 --> 00:32:01,236
People think House
has no inner censor,

705
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:03,530
but the fact is he
holds himself back.

706
00:32:03,614 --> 00:32:05,699
Because when he
wants to hurt,

707
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:07,868
he knows just where
to poke a sharp stick.

708
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,832
I have been trying
to get pregnant,
and House knew.

709
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,501
He told me I would
fail as a mother.

710
00:32:17,877 --> 00:32:21,588
And you're this upset
because you think he's right?

711
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,465
I've had three
separate implantations.

712
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,425
The first two never took.

713
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:28,345
The last one, I lost.

714
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:30,472
I'm sorry.

715
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,891
You didn't fail.
Those were physical events.

716
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:39,313
A little girl is scared
and in pain.

717
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:45,110
I was awkward,
terrified of
doing the wrong thing.

718
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:46,528
That's normal. That's...

719
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,655
I didn't hug her.

720
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,865
I didn't even reach out
and hold her hand.

721
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:52,575
I told her it
was gonna be okay.

722
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:53,785
She needed reassurance.

723
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:56,787
I told her, her folks
might get back together.

724
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,711
When I see people
with their kids,
it's so natural.

725
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:08,215
It's like they have
an instruction book
imprinted on their genes.

726
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,091
Maybe I just
didn't get a copy.

727
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:13,094
Maybe my wanting to
be a mother is like

728
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:15,221
a tone-deaf person
wanting to sing opera,

729
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:16,973
or a paraplegic
who wants to...

730
00:33:17,014 --> 00:33:17,973
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

731
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:24,688
Well, I see what you mean
about House poking
the right spot.

732
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:51,171
Chloramphenicol
isn't working.

733
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,550
What dose
did you give her?

734
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,760
Yeah, maybe Chase
screwed up.

735
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,679
You always end up there.

736
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:02,222
Just getting a jump on it.

737
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:03,849
I doubled her up.

738
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:06,601
The infection's morphed.

739
00:34:07,227 --> 00:34:08,895
It's moved into
her muscle sheath.

740
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:10,688
Necrotizing fasciitis?

741
00:34:11,356 --> 00:34:13,358
That's impervious to drugs.

742
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:17,278
The only treatment
is to cut away
the infected area.

743
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:19,488
So, we amputate.

744
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,906
Arm and leg?

745
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,783
CAMERON: We can't cut
a six-year-old kid in half

746
00:34:22,908 --> 00:34:24,785
without a confirmed diagnosis.

747
00:34:24,826 --> 00:34:27,537
Moves too quickly,
and we waited too long.

748
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,164
We don't have
time for a culture.

749
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:30,915
We can at least observe her
for a few hours,

750
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:32,709
confirm the rash is spreading.

751
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:35,002
It spreads, she dies.

752
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:36,712
You're talking
about crippling her.

753
00:34:36,837 --> 00:34:38,881
We're not even certain
this was an infection.

754
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:41,175
Right! She's six!
She's cute!

755
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,594
She can't have
flesh-eating bacteria!

756
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:45,554
It's just wrong!

757
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,389
Let's cure her
with sunshine and puppies.

758
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:51,351
Cute kids die of
terrible illnesses,
innocent doctors go to jail,

759
00:34:51,392 --> 00:34:53,019
and it's because
cowards like you

760
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:54,771
won't stand up
and do what's required.

761
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:57,732
You can sit around
and moan about
who's the bigger weakling.

762
00:34:57,815 --> 00:34:59,650
I'm going to go do my job.

763
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,002
<i>EDIE.: What kind of quality
of life will she have
without...</i>

764
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:23,422
<i>HOUSE.: Great thing about life,
it's got qualities.</i>

765
00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:26,883
<i>MR. HARTMANN.:
And if we can't agree?</i>

766
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,428
CUDDY: I don't know.

767
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:31,901
He's yelled at us before.

768
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:33,277
Because he thought
our theories were dumb.

769
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:34,987
Not because our theories
were sending him to jail.

770
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:36,572
He's going
through withdrawal.

771
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:38,240
Could be causing
mild paranoia.

772
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:40,117
It'll pass. We just
have to suffer through it.

773
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,243
We never ruled out allergy.

774
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:43,078
We gave her drugs.
She had no negative reaction.

775
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,288
We cut open her belly,
she got a rash on her belly.

776
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:47,916
We did a scratch test
on her back,
she got a rash on her back.

777
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:50,335
I know House ruled out mojo,
but it can't be
a coincidence...

778
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:53,254
A little late to
play differential games,
isn't it?

779
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,255
Get that thing away
from me.

780
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:55,381
I don't want to get burned.

781
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,383
Laser pointers
don't burn you, genius.

782
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,843
Skin, no. Retina, yes.

783
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,678
You don't trust my aim?

784
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,638
Maybe you should
cover any sensitive...

785
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,685
He was wrong
about the puppies.

786
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,566
House! You got to stop
the surgery.

787
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,276
She doesn't have
necrotizing fasciitis.

788
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,277
Oh, good.

789
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,029
She's got
erythropoietic protoporphyria.

790
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,822
She's allergic to light.

791
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,407
It's genetic.
Either parent
could have carried it.

792
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,575
I know what it is.
Infection fits better.

793
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:28,620
She gets worse
every time she goes
under surgical lights,

794
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:29,871
dad takes her outside...

795
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,206
Her liver's shot, too.

796
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:32,665
Did she swallow a flashlight?

797
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:33,791
Stop the surgery.

798
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,084
Get the hell out of my way.

799
00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:36,127
No, I'm...

800
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:44,718
Light damages
the blood cells,

801
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,262
the damaged
blood cells contain
protoporphyrin,

802
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:50,014
the protoporphyrin
builds up in the liver.

803
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,559
That's why
the liver's shutting down.

804
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,868
(PHONE RINGING)

805
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,668
Stop.

806
00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:27,215
How can she be
allergic to light?

807
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,009
She's never had
this problem before.

808
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:31,344
The negative reaction
starts at birth.

809
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:33,721
It reaches critical mass
around this age.

810
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:37,933
<i>CUDD Y.: Her blood cells
create chemicals
in reaction to light.</i>

811
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:42,020
<i>When they reach the liver,
it tries to filter
out the bad cells.</i>

812
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:44,064
<i>The chemicals
damage the liver,</i>

813
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:46,149
<i>and one
byproduct is gallstones.</i>

814
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:49,527
So, she'll just
keep getting worse?

815
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:51,029
EP can be managed.

816
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:52,697
We'll give her beta-carotene.

817
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,741
She's gonna need
special light bulbs
and filters on the windows.

818
00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:57,410
She's probably gonna need
to be home-schooled.

819
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:00,788
Her life will be complicated,
but she will live.

820
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:03,081
How do you get
something like this?

821
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:04,249
It's genetic.

822
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,751
So, one of us...

823
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:12,257
Both of you must be carriers.

824
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:17,511
She's gonna want to see you
when she wakes up.

825
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:20,556
So, don't screw it up.

826
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:49,916
So, what's new?

827
00:39:52,585 --> 00:39:53,586
House missed one.

828
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:55,338
That's happened before.

829
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:57,089
He nearly maimed
a little girl.

830
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:59,091
And I got it right.

831
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,802
And I told him,
and it didn't matter.

832
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,889
Chase, you solved one.

833
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:07,974
You helped a patient,
that better be
enough for you.

834
00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:09,100
Beckett was going
to call his play

835
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:12,061
<i>Waiting for House's Approval,
but decided it was too grim.</i>

836
00:40:12,145 --> 00:40:13,313
Trust me,

837
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:16,065
I'm not waiting anymore.

838
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:57,895
I'm gonna need
30 pieces of silver.
