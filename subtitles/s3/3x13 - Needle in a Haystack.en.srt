2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,920
Wait. We shouldn't...
We shouldn't be doing this.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,960
What? You're not having fun?

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,040
It's not that. I just...

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,800
Rather be with the boys?

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
No.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
Well, then come on.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,640
(BANGING)

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,560
You kids need any help?

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,960
No. No, we're fine.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,160
Car trouble?

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,280
No.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,960
Then why are you here?

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,240
We're just talking.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,160
Does she do all the talking?

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,480
Most of it.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
I know what that's like.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,400
I'm gonna come back
through here in 10 minutes,

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,960
and if you're still here,
I'm gonna call your parents.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,240
Yes, sir. Thank you.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,640
Now, where were we?

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,560
We were going.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,120
In nine minutes.

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,280
Wait...

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
Stevie? What's wrong?

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,720
Oh, my God!

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,440
Help! Someone help me!

28
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,200
(WATER SPLASHING)

29
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,080
Sixteen-year-old
with respiratory arrest.

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,960
The only thing I hate more
than a thief
is a crippled thief.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,960
Yeah, me, too.
No sign of trauma, no history

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
of asthma or...
Who the hell is J. Whitner?

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,840
No idea. Stevie Lipa's EKG
and echocardiogram
were normal, but...

34
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,160
Normal is good. Send him home.

35
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,320
J. Whitner, doctor.
Who is he,
and where do I find him?

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,280
She's the new researcher,
works with Ereshevsky.

37
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
Is she hot?
She's in a wheelchair.

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,160
Doesn't mean she's not hot.

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,640
Just means
she can't bend over,

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,800
so Cuddy has to
bend over backwards.

41
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,120
Sixteen-year-old kid.
ER workup revealed
a bloody pleural effusion.

42
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,480
That's odd.

43
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,920
Yeah, that occurred to me.

44
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,840
What took you so long
to mention it?

45
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,560
No tumors or pneumonia
on the CT.

46
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,720
He passed out
while making out.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
If he's into sex,
drugs and rock and roll
can't be that far behind.

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,920
I'm guessing cocaine.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
Tox screen was clean.

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,480
Just means he wasn't on drugs,
not that he hasn't been
using drugs.

51
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,280
Looks like a plumbing problem
to me. Leaky pipes.

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,720
If he popped an aneurysm,
he'd be in the morgue,
not the ER.

53
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
That's why you're gonna
do a venogram
instead of an arteriogram.

54
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,320
This is not
a high-pressure burst.
It's a low-pressure leak.

55
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,160
Still could've been drugs
that caused the pipes
to corrode in the first place.

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,600
So go look under his mattress.

57
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,200
See if he's got any pills
or powder stashed
with the hand lotion.

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,440
Sweet ride. I asked for
the one with the sissy bar
and the banana seat,

59
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,800
but Santa gave me
this instead. Guess that's
what I get for being naughty.

60
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,160
You must be Dr. House.

61
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Yeah.

62
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,800
So looks like there's been
some sort of mix-up
at the parking office.

63
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,600
They had to move me closer
to the door.

64
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Had to? You don't look
like the type to
pull a weapon.

65
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
Wheelchair.
Cane.

66
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,360
I think you should do the
honorable thing and let me
have my space back.

67
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,600
Oh, well,
since you asked so nicely,
wheelchair.

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,600
Cane.
Walking long distances
makes my leg hurt.

69
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,200
And it's easy for me?

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
Of course not.
Pushing that little lever?

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
The muscles must burn.
I'm sure the last 10 yards
are pure torture.

72
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,800
Crossing the parking lot
is dangerous.
Cars can't see me.

73
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,120
You ever hit a patch
of black ice with a cane?

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,760
No, gosh,
on account of the fact
that I can't walk.

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Maybe you should ask
the parking office
for some crampons.

76
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,400
This is about who can most
easily cross the parking lot.
You're the winner.

77
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,440
Oh, and the prize
is apparently a parking space.

78
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,320
There's still no answer
at either one of your
parent's cell numbers.

79
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Is there any other way
we might be
able to contact them?

80
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,960
No, they're in a conference.

81
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,200
They probably had
to turn them off or something.

82
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,320
What does it matter
where they are?
I mean, he's in pain.

83
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,480
You gotta do something.

84
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,760
We need them to sign this.

85
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,880
Why can't he just
sign the papers? He's 16.

86
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,240
Still not an adult.

87
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,080
Then call my parents.
They know him, and they'll
take responsibility,

88
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,680
do whatever you need.
I can't. It won't...

89
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,360
You can't just let him
sit here in agony until
his parents finally decide...

90
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
Leah, it's okay.

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
No, it's not.

92
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,520
I feel like there's an anvil
sitting on my chest.

93
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
(MONITOR BEEPING)

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,280
You win. I'm doing the
venogram now. We'll deal
with the fallout later.

95
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,640
(COUGHING)

96
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,240
My fingers feel wet.

97
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,720
That's just the dye.
Your nerves can't
tell the difference

98
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,200
between the cold
inside your body and
the wet outside your body.

99
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,600
The nerves can't tell the
difference, or the brain can't
interpret the difference?

100
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,920
A little of both.
You like science?

101
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,400
Looks like
a diffusion pattern.

102
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,000
That's because it's
the venous side. Low pressure.

103
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,040
So Graham's law applies.

104
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
You've taken physics already?

105
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,120
No, I just sort of
read up on my own.

106
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,040
I had to teach myself a lot
of stuff, too. Schools sucked
where I grew up.

107
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,800
You go to public or private?

108
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,960
Public.

109
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,720
Leak has to be in
the pulmonary veins
to get in my lungs, right?

110
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,960
Yep.

111
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,600
I don't see anything. Do you?

112
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
No.

113
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,840
It doesn't make sense.

114
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,560
How can I have
a bloody effusion
without any bleeding?

115
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,160
(COUGHING)

116
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,720
This is putrid.

117
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Put food-borne parasites
and infections
on the list to check on.

118
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,120
I'll take the bedroom.

119
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,880
Oh. Sorry, I didn't know
there was anyone.

120
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,240
We were just...

121
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,240
Oh, God! I have a gun.

122
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,200
Look, you can take
whatever you want.
My wallet's in my suit.

123
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,760
Freeze! Freeze!

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm calling the cops.

125
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,160
Okay, you don't have a gun,
and you're not
calling the cops.

126
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,960
Oh, no, I'm calling the cops
unless you two
get out of here right now.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,280
"Unless"? Who calls the cops
unless a burglar
does something?

128
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,760
You don't want to
have to explain the affair.

129
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,560
We're not having an affair.

130
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,680
He's got a ring. You don't.

131
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,680
And judging from the state
of the kitchen downstairs

132
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,200
and the half-vacuumed bedroom,

133
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,800
I'm guessing
you're a better lover
than you are a maid.

134
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,400
Maid? You son of a bitch.

135
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,520
I'm not a maid, okay?
This is my house, not his.

136
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,960
Sorry.
And what's wrong
with my kitchen?

137
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,640
Nothing. We're sorry.
We're just here
to help Stevie.

138
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,800
Who's Stevie?

139
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,360
Your son?

140
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,960
It was the address you gave.

141
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
The ER must have
written it down wrong.

142
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,720
Or you lied because
you don't want us to
talk to your parents.

143
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,200
I gave you their
phone numbers.

144
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,840
You gave us some numbers.
We haven't been able to
reach anyone.

145
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,120
I told you,
they must be in a conference.

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,280
He's lying.

147
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,880
Leah.

148
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,800
He's Romany, a Gypsy.

149
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,560
So you don't have a home?

150
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,040
Of course we do.

151
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,960
What, next you're gonna ask me
about dancing around campfires

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,480
and stealing children?
This is why
I don't tell people.

153
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,960
<i>They share everything with
each other and nothing with
the gadje, the outsiders.</i>

154
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,280
Sharing information with
outsiders has not gone
so well for my people.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Right now you're making
yourself more vulnerable
by lying to us.

156
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,320
You can't go to my house.
You'll pollute it.

157
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
All we're gonna do
is look around.

158
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,040
Your presence is enough.

159
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,200
My parents take it seriously.
It's spiritual as much
as it is physical.

160
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,320
You know where he lives?

161
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,800
Don't.

162
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,680
Look, I'll tell you
whatever you need to know.

163
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,120
If we can't
trust your answers...

164
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,080
I drink sometimes, okay?
I've smoked pot.

165
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,840
I'll tell you anything,
the truth. You just...

166
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,240
You can't go in my home.

167
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,640
The pot wouldn't cause
a bleeding problem.
A pesticide on the pot could.

168
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,560
Where did you get it?

169
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,680
Some kid at school.

170
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
Stevie. He got the pot
from me.

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,960
He doesn't even go to school.
His parents made him drop out.

172
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm home-schooled.
He reads books.

173
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,560
What else are you lying about?
Is your father really
a professor?

174
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,240
He's a salesman.

175
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,560
They buy and sell
anything they can
get their hands on.

176
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,120
They? So you're with your dad
when he's making these deals?

177
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,080
He was just in Chicago
a week ago.

178
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,160
You fly?

179
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,320
No, my dad's got a truck.

180
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,280
You can't be serious.

181
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,720
Actually, I can.

182
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,120
See? It's my space.
I want it back.

183
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,720
It's not your space.
It's the hospital's space,

184
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,600
and the hospital thinks that
the person who's worse off
should get the better space.

185
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Your application for
a handicap space says
you can walk 50 yards.

186
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,040
And Whitner's says
she can roll 50 miles

187
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,120
between oil changes.
I can't change my leg.

188
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,640
The space I moved you to
is only 46 yards away
from the front door.

189
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,280
I measured. You'll be fine.
Great.

190
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,160
So I can collapse four yards
into the lobby instead of
outside in the cold.

191
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,000
As long as
it's not in my office.
Do you know who won

192
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,960
the New York City Marathon
six years in a row?
Guy in a wheelchair.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,880
Then go get yourself one,
and leave me alone.

194
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,640
Give me my space,
I'll be happy to
roll around all day.

195
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,520
You couldn't last one week
in a wheelchair.

196
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,680
Wanna bet?

197
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
What's wrong with you?

198
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,040
Nothing that a week off
my feet won't solve.

199
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,560
Venogram's negative. No leak.

200
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,680
You mean you couldn't
find the leak.

201
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,800
Is your leg worse?

202
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,120
No, my parking spot is.

203
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,480
Blood is only made inside
the circulatory system,

204
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
which means when we
find it outside...
There's no leak.

205
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,160
I even checked lymphatics.
So you're gonna spend a week

206
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,600
in a wheelchair just to get
a parking space
closer to the front door?

207
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,160
Easier than chopping off
my legs.

208
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,520
We've ruled out toxins
and drugs.

209
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,240
Kind of. He's Romany.
Apparently, they feel the need
to keep secrets,

210
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,960
so it's hard to know
anything for sure.

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,360
Yeah, he's also a human being,

212
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,160
which means
you shouldn't be trusting him
to begin with.

213
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,520
Stop relying on his answers
and find some on your own.

214
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
It's a deep-vein thrombosis.

215
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,760
The kid spent 16 hours
in the back seat
of an old pick-up.

216
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,680
Causes a clot,
makes its way to his lungs.

217
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,960
We should do an arteriogram,
find the clot,
bust it with TPA.

218
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,080
Or we can find the leak.

219
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,440
There's no leak.

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,800
Hey, you can't yell at a guy
in a wheelchair.

221
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,520
This is a slow leak.
You've got to speed it up.

222
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,240
Thin his blood.
Redo the venogram.

223
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,760
That could cause
a massive bleed.

224
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,280
Excellent.
Massive will be
even easier to find.

225
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,560
Pardon me. I guess you guys
are gonna have to
get the next one.

226
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
I thought you were
redoing the venogram.

227
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,840
As soon as we're done
with the arteriogram.

228
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,280
Okay, you're gonna feel
a little poke.

229
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,440
Can you maybe do that?

230
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,920
Don't worry. It's just
your leg. I don't have to
go any further than this.

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,880
Take a look at this,
bones of your forearm.

232
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,840
Radius and ulna.

233
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,280
How about the wrist?

234
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,880
Lunate, hamate, the...

235
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,240
"Scared lovers
try positions
they can't handle."

236
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,880
It's a mnemonic for
the wrist bones. It's the
only way I can remember them.

237
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,760
(GROANING)

238
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,480
FOREMAN: You okay?

239
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,520
My stomach.
Did you hit something?

240
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,280
I barely started.
Lie flat.

241
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,440
No, I can't.
It hurts too much.
I'm getting out.

242
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,040
It's our only chance
to see what's going on.

243
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,520
If he moves,
I could shred his artery.

244
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,640
Get it out now!

245
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,320
It's gonna be okay, Stevie.
Just inject the dye.

246
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,280
Dye's going into his liver,
but it's not coming out.

247
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,600
Clot's gotta be constricting
the flow in the hepatic vein.

248
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,320
It's not constricting it.
It's completely blocking it.
His whole liver's fried.

249
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,160
The kid's liver's failing
because of a massive clot

250
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,920
that's blocking his
hepatic vein. How can he have
both a bleed and a clot?

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,560
It's not a clot.
You must have blocked the vein

252
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,520
with a catheter wire.
Not a chance.

253
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,480
Increased pressure downstream
could also stop the blood.

254
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,680
There's no heart failure
or cirrhosis.
Means it has to be a clot.

255
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,120
Massive clots block veins.
They don't make them leak.

256
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,080
And since he clearly
has some kind of...

257
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
You having a little problem?

258
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,280
Would you mind?

259
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,880
Boy, that was humiliating.
How does Whitner
make it through the day?

260
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,160
"Pride goeth before the fall."

261
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,440
Lucky for me,
I'm sitting in one
of these babies.

262
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,560
So what other theories
can I shoot down?

263
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,920
DIC would explain both the...

264
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,200
His platelets are normal,
and his PTT isn't elevated.

265
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,800
Leukemia?
Normal CBC, and differential?

266
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,240
You guys are still thinking
like doctors when you should
be thinking like plumbers.

267
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Come on, I wanna see
some butt crack.

268
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,920
Something inside the liver
is punching holes
in the pipes.

269
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,680
Blood bleeds through
the opening, sticks to
the intruder, forms a mass.

270
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,280
A clot.
A mass.

271
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,320
Cancer? A tumor could
erode a blood vessel.

272
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,040
Well, so could a granuloma
from tuberculosis
or sarcoidosis.

273
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,240
Do a CT, MRI,
sputum and ACE level.

274
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,920
Excuse me. Sorry.
Cripple coming through.

275
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,560
He says his throat hurts.

276
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,320
That phrasing means
you think it doesn't.

277
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,760
No, I don't.

278
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,680
Good enough for me.
Where are you going?

279
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,880
Mothers know best.
Get yourself a sucker
on the way out.

280
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,800
Look, I think he's just faking
so he doesn't have to
go to school.

281
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,880
How did you know
I was a truant officer?

282
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,720
I told him he had a choice,
go to school or the doctor.

283
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,640
Right. He's wasting
your precious time,
so you decided to waste mine.

284
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,200
How thoughtful.

285
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,960
I'm in a wheelchair,
so I can't examine him
all the way up there.

286
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,840
Hop down.
My life is just
one horror after another.

287
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,160
Open.

288
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,680
Does it look like it hurts?

289
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,920
No.

290
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,240
What's that?

291
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,200
Syringe. I'm with you.

292
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,120
Make him hate
the doctor's office
more than he hates school.

293
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,040
That's okay.
I don't think that's...

294
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,160
It's just saline.

295
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
Hurts like hell
when it's injected directly
into the muscle.

296
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,480
So what do you think,
arm or ass?

297
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,840
I think he's
learned his lesson.

298
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,360
Oh, I don't know.
We better check.

299
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Jack, is your mommy a big,
fat idiot?

300
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,240
Well, what do you know?
I guess you were right.

301
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,000
Just hold still, Stevie.
This shouldn't take long.

302
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,640
Sorry, I'm guessing
the mike in this thing
doesn't pick up nods.

303
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,920
Smart kid.

304
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,520
Too bad it's all
gonna go to waste.

305
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,000
Nothing wrong
with being a salesman.

306
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,560
He should be able to
pursue his own life,

307
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,120
not be stuck
helping his parents
sell old toasters.

308
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,320
He's still young.
You never know what
he'll end up doing.

309
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,640
Unless he goes back to school,
I know exactly
what he'll end up doing.

310
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,080
Wait. A lesion?

311
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,960
CHASE: Magnifying times five.

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,320
CAMERON: It's a granuloma.

313
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,160
It means Wegener's
is the most likely.

314
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
Stevie!
Mom, is that you?

315
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,920
Get him out of this now.

316
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,120
Your son is sick.
The sign on the door...

317
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,040
The sign says, "No metal."
We took everything off.

318
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
It says, "No admittance."

319
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,120
What's wrong with our son?
We don't know yet.

320
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,360
He's not gonna die, is he?

321
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,960
Your son is very ill.
We're still trying to
figure out why,

322
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,560
which is why
we need you to leave the room.

323
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,040
What are you gonna do now?

324
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,880
Oh, now I've got to
slide my butt from
one padded seat to another.

325
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,880
What if I bump my knee?

326
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
MRI showed
a granuloma in his liver.

327
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,560
Fantastic.

328
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,640
Wanna give me a hand here?
No.

329
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,960
Clotting, bleeding
and a granuloma
equals Wegener's.

330
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,840
I know.
That's why I said fantastic.
I was being sincere.

331
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,800
Now, give me a hand.
Wouldn't be fair.

332
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,520
We're gonna biopsy
the liver to confirm.

333
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,880
Wouldn't be fair not to.

334
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,560
People are good and kind
and gentle and help people
in wheelchairs.

335
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,120
You don't believe that.
But you do.

336
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,720
No, I don't.

337
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,920
Foreman, forget the biopsy.

338
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,640
His liver will be gone
before you get the results.

339
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,200
Start treatment
with cyclophosphamide

340
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,040
before the Wegener's
punches a hole
in another pipe.

341
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,720
What's with the clothes?
You're not being discharged.

342
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,480
I know.

343
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,600
It's my parents.
They insist that I wear
this stuff.

344
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,320
We insist on our on food,
gown and furnishings
for a reason.

345
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,160
Hey, my chest burns.
Are you sure the treatments
are working?

346
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,360
Wegener's causes the body
to attack itself.

347
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,600
That doesn't get undone
overnight. Be patient.

348
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,720
Where's your soup?

349
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,080
It's in the garbage.

350
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,640
It has willow-bark extract.

351
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,280
Willow-bark extract
is basically aspirin.

352
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,840
Yes, for the fever.

353
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,880
He's already on meds,
our meds.

354
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,560
We can't risk any
adverse interactions.

355
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,720
We need all this stuff to go.
We need to control
this environment.

356
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,360
So do we. People get sick
for a reason,

357
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
'cause something in their life
is out of balance.

358
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,080
Dad, he's a doctor.
He doesn't want to
hear your talk.

359
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,000
Balance is just starting
to be restored
now that that girl is gone.

360
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,320
That girl took pretty good
care of your son
while you were away.

361
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Yes, we can see that.

362
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,960
Look, all this stuff may make
him feel more comfortable,
but it's not gonna...

363
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,280
How long is this treatment
gonna take?

364
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,760
We should start to see
some improvement

365
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,120
in his liver function soon.

366
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,320
Soon. Very scientific.

367
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,800
I'll be back in a little bit
to check on you.

369
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,960
Ah, yes, if it isn't
Dr. Ironside.

370
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Ah, if it isn't
Dr. "I Had No Friends
When I Was Growing Up,

371
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,840
"So All I Did Was Watch TV

That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

375

(EXCLAIMS)

376
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,360
Safe from Cuddy,
but I guess not from
her trusted rat-complice.

377
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,720
Reasonable people don't debate
the relative merits
of their handicaps.

378
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,560
Reasonable people
make rules based on evidence,

379
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,720
like difficulty
covering a distance,

380
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,440
say, 50 yards, not on
some preordained
patheticness scale.

381
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,320
Last I checked, pigheadedness
was not the eighth
heavenly virtue.

382
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
It's only pigheaded
if you're wrong.
If you're right,

383
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,440
they call it,
"Sticking to your principles."

384
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,000
Give it up.
You're demeaning yourself.

385
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,680
That's what they told
Rosa Parks.

386
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,360
Don't stand up in there.
I'm watching your feet.

387
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,640
Get out of our home.

388
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,920
This is not a home.

389
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,960
It's certainly not...

390
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,280
It's our home as long as
our son is here.

391
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,320
Mom, Dad, will you please
just calm down.

392
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,480
You're not family.
You have no right to be here.

393
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,080
<i>What are you gonna do?
Throw me out? You can't
even touch the gadje.</i>

394
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,040
I'll touch you.
What is going on?

395
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,760
I'm the one who brought
him here. I should be
able to see how he's doing.

396
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,840
He wouldn't even need
to be here
if it weren't for you.

397
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,720
Right. I'm so unclean,
I caused his liver
to shut down.

398
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,680
Enough. No one is leaving.

399
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,680
He's our son,
and we want her out of here.

400
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,160
(GROANING)

401
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,520
It hurts.
It's your stomach again?

402
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,160
No.
What?

403
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,880
FOREMAN: His liver's
actually improving.

404
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,200
We plug one hole
and end up poking another.

405
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,640
Are we talking about
the patient or how to
get a raise from Cuddy?

406
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,560
The Wegener's treatment
gave him a massive hemorrhage
in his bladder.

407
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,960
Which means it's Wegener's.

408
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,160
What did I just say?

409
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,320
We were treating him
for Wegener's when
everything went wrong.

410
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Not everything.

411
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,880
Yeah, it was a very
lovely day outside.

412
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,280
On the other hand,
the treatment made him worse.

413
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Treatment made his
bladder worse, not his liver.

414
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,760
Clot in the liver's
breaking up.

415
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,040
And MRI, sputum and ACE
ruled out TB,
sarcoidosis and lymphoma,

416
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,400
which leaves us with...

417
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,600
Still could be
a cancer with multiple...

418
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,680
A cancer we can't see
on MRI, CT or blood tests?

419
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,960
It's Wegener's.

420
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,560
It's not the wrong diagnosis.
It's the wrong treatment.

421
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,960
We could increase
immunosuppression.
Add methotrexate.

422
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,360
We can't give methotrexate
to a kid who's already
had lung problems.

423
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,000
Methotrexate is
carpet bombing.
Hits everything.

424
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,080
We need a smart bomb.

425
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,320
We don't suppress
the immune system.
We change it.

426
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,600
Immune modulation. FT28.
His antibodies are
attacking his blood vessels.

427
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,920
The irritation causes it
to bleed and clot.
We change his immune system

428
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,080
<i>so the antibodies
don't interact
with his blood vessels</i>

429
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,680
but work fine
everywhere else.

430
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,520
FT28 is still experimental.
It's not FDA approved.

431
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,080
It's worked for
Crohn's disease
and rheumatoid arthritis.

432
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,680
He doesn't have Crohn's
or arthritis.

433
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,960
Let's say that he does
and start the treatment.

434
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,360
Absolutely not.

435
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,920
My people have been
experimented on before.
Never again.

436
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,360
Mister Lipa,
with all due respect,

437
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,680
comparing this hospital
with Auschwitz,
it's ridiculous.

438
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,920
FT28 has been proven
safe in hundreds...

439
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,480
People always say
you can trust them.

440
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,640
Why would they
say anything else?

441
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,240
Why do they think
we would listen?

442
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,440
You think I don't understand
what it's like to come
from a people

443
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,560
who've been enslaved,
mistreated
and experimented on?

444
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,440
Tuskegee went on
for 28 years
after World War II.

445
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,880
And the laws that made it
illegal for the Romany
to even set foot

446
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,000
in this state were still
on the books until 1998.
It's not ancient history.

447
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,720
Conventional therapy
hasn't worked.
Your son may be dying.

448
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,360
He needs a targeted approach,
and you need to trust us.

449
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm sorry. A lifetime
of experiences tells me
I can't trust you,

450
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,000
and the past three days
have done nothing
to change that.

451
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,680
We want our son treated,
not experimented on.

452
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,680
If you don't know how to
do that, then just tell us,

453
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,120
so we can take him
someplace where they do.

454
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,000
They're absolutely right.
Stay away

455
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,040
from that unproven,
experimental stuff.
Much better to stick

456
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,240
with the "moving the furniture
until he gets better"
approach.

457
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,440
Yes, you're right.
We're gonna have to come up
with something else.

458
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,600
Do you mean another
last-ditch, desperation move?
You got anything?

459
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,520
Go back and don't take no
for an answer. What kind of
salesman are you?

460
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
The kind who avoids the house
with the crazy couple

461
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,840
who put tin foil
over their windows.

462
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,040
They got money for tin foil,

463
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,560
they got money for
whatever you're selling.

464
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,120
What's that mean?

465
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,840
It means that if they don't
trust you, you should
earn that lack of trust.

466
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,880
What does paying
for tinfoil mean?

467
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,520
Why should I have
to answer all the questions?

468
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,800
Oops.

469
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,240
Sorry. Still getting used to
the power steering.

470
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
I assume you've
heard the news?

471
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,760
I'm not worried.

472
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,800
From what I hear,
what you lack in shame,
you also lack in willpower.

473
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,080
My will may be weak,
but my backbone is strong

474
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,800
and pain-free
now that I've stopped
using the cane.

475
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,080
Of course,
it's harder to look down
Cuddy's shirt,

476
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,280
but then the vantage point
on her ass has much improved.

477
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,600
Then that's just me,
always looking
on the bright side.

478
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,760
I'm the guy who said
that her C-cups are half full.

479
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,280
They are nice, aren't they?

480
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,880
Oh, no, no, no,
you're not gonna win me
over that easily.

481
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,280
You may have a wheel.
It doesn't mean you get
the grease.

482
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,080
You gotta squeak.

483
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
What's that?

484
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,120
It's cyclophosphamide.

485
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,560
We're continuing
the standard treatment
as you requested.

486
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,080
I have to ask everyone
to leave the room
for a few minutes

487
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,240
while I apply some bandages.

488
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,960
Why do we have to leave?

489
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,000
They're for his penis.

490
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,640
You lied to them.
The bleeding's stopped.
I don't need any bandages.

491
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,400
I need to change
your treatment,

492
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,360
but your parents won't let us.
They've got it in their minds

493
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,360
that we want to try some sort
of inhuman experiment on you.

494
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,000
The treatment's experimental?

495
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,520
FT28 has been
through extensive
clinical trials.

496
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,440
It's also been used
successfully
for other conditions.

497
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,000
The fact that you're
recommending
experimental treatment

498
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,360
means you have
no other options.

499
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,040
Sorry. We stop
the pleural effusions,
your liver almost fails.

500
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,920
We save your liver,
the bladder fails.

501
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,240
If we don't get ahead
of the curve on this...

502
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
What do you need me to do?

503
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,400
Take the medicine,
but don't tell your parents.

504
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,760
I don't like lying
to my parents.

505
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,080
The rest of the world,
though...

506
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,640
The rest of the world
I can't trust.

507
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,280
You can trust me.

508
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,600
How do I know?

509
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,360
Because if you do this,
then tell your parents,
I lose my license.

510
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,600
(GROANS)

511
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,880
God.
Get in here.

512
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,160
Wow, his spleen
basically exploded, huh?

513
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,800
Got another bleeder.
2-O silk on a stick.

514
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,720
Got it.

515
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,960
I believe you ordered
your meat rare.

516
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,280
Keep him open.
If I confirm Wegener's,

517
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,200
might as well stage
the disease while he's
still on the table.

518
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,200
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

519
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,480
External capsule's
ruptured but still intact.

520
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,920
No signs of a clot or a bleed.
Normal follicles,
normal lymphoid tissue.

521
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,080
<i>His spleen is ripped
to shreds. There's gotta be
granulomas. Keep looking.</i>

522
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,640
Come on,
can't leave Humpty Dumpty
like this forever.

523
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,920
I don't see anything
but normal spleen.
No granulomas.

524
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
Means no Wegener's.

525
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,560
That's all I need to know.
Let's go people.

526
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,840
<i>Run his bowel.</i>

527
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,720
No need. I'm closing.

528
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,720
Suture.

529
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,720
Run his bowel.

530
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,680
Nothing suspicious
in the spleen.

531
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,200
Get him out of here.

532
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,480
You missed it.

533
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,440
He had a granuloma
in his liver.

534
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,480
No, it was just scar tissue.

535
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,680
Looks like a granuloma
on the MRI, but it's not.

536
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,520
I don't know why I'm debating
this. Pass me the
Kelly clamp. I'm closing.

537
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,400
Not unless you're gonna sew
my hand into
this kid's stomach.

538
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,840
Get out of there.
He's unstable.

539
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,440
He's got Wegener's,
which means he's got
granulomas.

540
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm calling my lawyer.

541
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,760
It's only 26 feet.

542
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,600
If you were an ostrich,
you'd have a 46-foot wait.

543
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,200
(BEEPING)

544
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,680
Blood pressure's dropping.

545
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,160
Hang another bag
of Ringer's lactate.

546
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,480
I'm having nothing
to do with this.

547
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,120
Foreman, hang another bag...

548
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,920
Ringer's lactate. Got it.

549
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,760
Come on. Come on.
It's gotta be in here.
It's gotta be in here.

550
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,640
It's not.

551
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,400
Mind if we close?

552
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,600
It's a good thing we never
sold him on FT28.
His parents were right.

553
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,040
There's no way his parents
are gonna let us
near him again.

554
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,560
They won't be able to
transfer him until he's
recovered from the surgery.

555
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,760
You can add the surgical team
to the list of people who
won't let us near him.

556
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,080
Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots,
spleen explodes.

557
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,480
We should test for
Von Willebrand's.

558
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,480
Or just play tic-tac-toe.

559
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,800
Okay, X's are bleeds.
O's are clots.

560
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,040
We started in the lungs,
right? What did we do?

561
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,360
CT, sputum, two venograms.

562
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,320
It's one bleed, one clot,
then what?

563
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,840
Liver shut down, MRI, labs,
treated with cyclophophamide.

564
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,000
Whereupon he peed out
three units of O-negative,
another bleed.

565
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,000
Where is this going?
I don't know yet.

566
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,680
What's next?
Bladder, kidneys.

567
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,280
High-resolution CT scan,
UA and urine sediment.

568
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,400
GI tract?

569
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,760
You ran his small bowel
in the OR.

570
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,960
The large bowel's fixed
to the abdominal wall.

571
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,640
I didn't run that.
Because there was
no reason to.

572
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,600
He hasn't been having
any symptoms in his bowels.

573
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,080
Do a colonoscopy.

574
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,600
Because he's had no symptoms?

575
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,400
You lose your keys,
the first thing you do
is look everywhere

576
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,960
you might logically
have placed them.

577
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,320
When you don't find them,
then you start looking
in other places.

578
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,640
The medicine cabinet, freezer,
mailbox. We need to look
in this kid's mailbox.

579
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,920
Why don't we x-ray his feet?
They're fine, too.

580
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,000
Because we need to take
the center square to block.

581
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,160
Okay, even if that did
make sense, it's kind of hard
to do a colonoscopy

582
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,280
on a kid you can't get near.

583
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,760
He's in the ICU now.

584
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,600
His parent's only have
limited visiting privileges.

585
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,280
I like that kid.
He's got spunk.

586
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,440
Can't talk now. On guard duty.

587
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,640
You're still in that thing?

588
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,800
What thing?

589
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,800
Oh, this?
Forgot it was even there.

590
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,800
You know, even if you manage
not to get struck down
by a bolt of lightning,

591
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,640
and make it a week,
Cuddy's not gonna give you
the space.

592
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,680
She can't.

593
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,720
A bet's a bet.

594
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,160
Yes, and that rule outranks
the Americans
with Disabilities Act.

595
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,360
You think you've got logic
on your side, but Whitner's
got the legal system,

596
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,960
and legal beats logic
every time. Just ask OJ.

597
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,520
You're right.

598
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,280
I am?
Yeah.

599
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,920
So you're doing this even
though you know you've got
no legal leg to stand on?

600
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,640
Who needs legs when
you got wheels?
I'm gonna get that spot.

601
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,440
No way Cuddy is going to
gyp me.

602
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,640
What did you say?

603
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,880
I'll see you later.

604
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,040
Gonna have them
yelling at me
for the next 20 minutes.

605
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,440
Mucosa looks normal, healthy.
No lonely diverticula.

606
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,880
Blood pressure's dropping.
He's bleeding again.

607
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,520
CHASE: I'm in his colon.

608
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,080
Hurry up.
I am.

609
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,400
There's nothing there.

610
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,360
Wait. Wait. What's that?

611
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,920
A reflection?

612
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,760
No, it's something.

613
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,360
Looks like a...

614
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Toothpick.

615
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,080
Are you sure?

616
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,720
He must have swallowed it
accidentally and just figured
he'd digest it eventually.

617
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,240
When you two were making
out in the car, he must have
folded awkwardly,

618
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,080
<i>pushed the toothpick through
the wall of the intestine
and into the lung.</i>

619
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,160
Then it moved on to his liver
and made its way
to his bladder and spleen.

620
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,680
So that's it?
He's gonna be okay?

621
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,360
Yeah, small holes.

622
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,560
It shouldn't take that long
to heal now that
we've got it out.

623
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,080
See? See what you did?
Me?

624
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,240
If you hadn't been
kissing him...

625
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,800
That's what you heard?

626
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,360
It was the toothpick.
It was that disgusting
habit that you...

627
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,040
It would have just passed
right through him if he
hadn't been writhing around.

628
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,800
Isn't that right...

629
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,120
That's it?

630
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,120
Yeah, that's it.

631
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,440
Wood absorbs water,
becomes the same density
as the tissue around it.

632
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,560
That's why
it didn't show up
on the CT or MRI.

633
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,120
That's cool.

634
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,400
I mean, not cool for me,

635
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,400
but a lot of damage
for something so small.

636
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,720
You know, the lab here,
they have a paid intern
position.

637
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,880
It's usually given to
one of the kids
from the universities,

638
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,520
but if you want,
I could probably get you
an interview.

639
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,080
You know, some entry-level
stuff, some gopher work,

640
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,280
but you'd also have access
to a lot of cool things.

641
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,960
Thanks, really, but I can't.

642
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,760
Yes, you can.
Stevie, you're bright.

643
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,880
You have more curiosity
than 90% of the doctors
on this staff.

644
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,280
No, it's not that.
It's just...

645
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,000
I go to work every day
with my family, you know?

646
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,000
People I've known
my whole life.

647
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,960
I don't want to lose that.

648
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,880
You can have both.

649
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,840
No, I can't.

650
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,920
Because they don't
want to let you.

651
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,360
They shouldn't be
making you choose.

652
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,720
Maybe not, but they are.

653
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,200
I'm choosing them.

654
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,760
Change is hard.
Trust me, I know.

655
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,520
But it worked out for me.

656
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,680
You're a successful doctor.

657
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,040
Your name is on
journal articles.
I would love that.

658
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,720
It's just I see you
with Doctors Chase
and Cameron,

659
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,280
and you all got
empty ring fingers.

660
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,080
You're alone.

661
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,160
(LAUGHS)

662
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,040
This is my last day
living a life of leisure.

663
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,000
So are you gonna
tell Doctor Whitner
she's out of my space,

664
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,760
or can I?
Why would I do that?

665
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,520
Because you said that
you would, and lying is wrong.

666
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,480
I said I would give you
the space if you made it
a whole week...

667
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,280
Which I...
Didn't.

668
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,440
The bet didn't stipulate
that you had to be
in the chair for a week

669
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,880
unless you had to barge
into an operating room

670
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
and shove your hands
in a kid's bowels.

671
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,480
You know about that?

672
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,640
You lost.

673
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,360
I saved a life.

674
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,400
Two minutes
out of the chair
to save a kid's life.

675
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,600
You lost, House.

676
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,360
I earned that space.

677
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,920
No, you didn't.

678
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,600
I earn that space every day
I limp into that building
and do my damn job.

679
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,480
You lost.

680
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,600
Hey!

681
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,080
You were never gonna give me
that space, were you?
I saw Whitner the other day.

682
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,480
She knew about the bet,
didn't seem that worried.

683
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,840
She knew I'd win.

684
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,640
She doesn't know me.

685
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,520
In fact,
she doesn't know anything,
except what you tell her.

686
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,960
You told her that you
were never gonna give me
that space, didn't you?

687
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Just tell me,
do you at least feel
a little guilty?

688
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,320
You wanna teach me lessons,
don't make commitments
you can't keep.

689
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,720
How's it going?

690
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,680
How guilty does she look?

691
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,800
About an eight.

692
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,360
<i>That space is mine.
Vini, vidi, vinci.</i>

693
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,040
<i>(IN WAITING LINE PLAYING)</i>
