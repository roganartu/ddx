(KNOCK ON DOOR)

2
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:22,823
Fran? I'm Robin.

3
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:24,199
Please come in.

4
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:30,414
Cute home.
Two bedroom, one bath?

5
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,457
Yeah.

6
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:37,379
A guy I know collects those.
Says they're worth
a fortune on the internet.

7
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:38,505
Yeah.

8
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:42,468
You've never used
our agency before, have you?

9
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,219
Is it that obvious?

10
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:56,398
As you can see,
we offer a full range
of services.

11
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:58,942
"Round the World"?
Our deluxe package.

12
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,820
Offers all the services
of A, B, and C.

13
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:07,743
How much?
$1,000.

14
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,954
And satisfaction
is guaranteed. Twice.

15
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:14,583
I'll get the money.
I'll get ready.

16
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,596
Harrington?

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,139
(CAT MEWING)

18
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:33,227
Harrington, what are you
doing up there?

19
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:37,398
All right, now don't
take this personally
but you're gonna have to go...

20
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,524
Fran.

21
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:45,114
Is this okay?

22
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:51,078
Fran.

23
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:00,254
Fran, you all right?

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,717
Oh, God.

25
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,013
Fran?

26
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,833
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at 500 North Sycamore.

27
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:41,670
I don't know,
my friend collapsed.

28
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,998
And what were you doing
when you fainted?

29
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,086
We were just...
Looking for her cat.

30
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,798
And have you
banged your head recently?

31
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:26,882
No.

32
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:32,596
Is this a motion sickness
patch?

33
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,016
I must have
forgotten to take it off.
I just got back from a trip.

34
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:40,145
Scopolamine can cause
dizziness and blurred vision.

35
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,857
You probably hit your head
when you fell,
and that caused the blackout.

36
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:46,527
I thought those patches were
supposed to prevent you
from getting sick.

37
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,028
Every drug has a side effect.

38
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,655
But it might be a good idea
to keep your eye on her

39
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:51,907
for the next few hours
to make sure she's okay.

40
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:53,117
Actually...

41
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:54,618
She has to get back to work.

42
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:57,413
Is it important?

43
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:00,833
We just don't like people
to be alone
after they leave here.

44
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,835
I'm fine. Really.

45
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,295
I'm...
Fran?

46
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:07,881
Fran?

47
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:11,677
I got a seizure. Code cart.

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,845
What's wrong with her?

49
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,263
I have no idea.

50
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:16,932
Where's House?

51
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:21,395
GIRL: I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!

52
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,690
Antique vintner's cane.
Cost me $900.

53
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,233
It had a corkscrew in it.

54
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,193
That would explain
the vintner's reference.

55
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,487
It could be used as a weapon
against the pilot.

56
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,281
Only if he's stuck
in a bottle of zinfandel.

57
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:34,116
You'll get it back
when we land.

58
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,368
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!

59
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:39,079
Give her 20 milligrams
of antihistamine.
Could save her life.

60
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:40,622
'Cause if she doesn't shut up
I'll kill her.

61
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:43,083
Delivering goodwill
to yet another continent.

62
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,336
You only forced me to
deliver a speech,
not goodwill.

63
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:48,047
You gave
a three-minute speech.

64
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,549
You know how much
WHO accreditation
means to the hospital?

65
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,343
Well, it may have been short,
but it had girth.

66
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:55,262
And the room service thing
was just spiteful.

67
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,681
I was hungry.
$300 for a bottle of wine.

68
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,099
I was thirsty.

69
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,310
$120 on video services.

70
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:02,603
I was lonely.

71
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:05,230
That's 500 in expenses
I can't justify.

72
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,107
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

73
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,317
Right.

74
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,444
Here you are, sir.
You're welcome.

75
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:14,698
Welcome aboard, Mr. House.

76
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,408
You're right here in 2-A.

77
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:21,413
Ms. Cuddy you're
in the next cabin
and to the left, 9-C.

78
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,415
No, I booked two
first-class tickets.

79
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:25,459
This must be a mistake.
No mistake.

80
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:28,587
I just arranged for
a $500 fare reduction.

81
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:30,255
Expense problem solved.

82
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,597
Where did you travel?
Duluth.

83
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,016
To visit my sister.
Really?

84
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:43,477
Is this her artwork?

85
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,190
"Fire butt"?

86
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,777
I was a little drunk.

87
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,696
Where were you a little drunk?

88
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,994
I turned 58 last March.

89
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:03,372
Same age my mother was
when she died.

90
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:06,625
Next week I packed a bag,
I went to JFK,

91
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:10,879
looked at the big board,
took the first plane
that went to a warm place.

92
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:13,674
Caracas.
Oh, my God.

93
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:16,010
Did you drink the water?
Eat salads?

94
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:17,845
Any raw foods.
Yup.

95
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,430
And?

96
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,772
I also did mescal shooters
and snorted cocaine from
a homosexual man's stomach.

97
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:33,360
Did you have sex?
No.

98
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:38,198
Not with him.
I had sex with El Gordo.

99
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:41,994
He was a large man.

100
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:43,203
Oh, my God.

101
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:48,459
I never do things like that.

102
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:53,005
I should have gone
to visit my sister.
It was stupid.

103
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:55,799
That's why I'm sick, isn't it?

104
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,720
It's possible.

105
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,269
(GROANING)

106
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:10,856
Here you are.
Rib eye, medium rare.

107
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:11,982
Thank you.

108
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:13,734
Some more Pinot Grigio?

109
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:16,612
No. I think I will
switch to the Syrah.

110
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:25,204
(GROANING)

111
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,378
Sir, are you all right?

112
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,629
He's drunk.

113
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:46,600
See?

114
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,143
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

115
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:50,479
Does anyone speak Korean?

116
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,524
Is anyone a doctor?

117
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,111
Yes.

118
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:00,739
I'll go get her.

119
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:11,625
(SNORING)

120
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:22,094
What do you want?

121
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:25,681
Do you really think
I was gonna leave you stuck
back here for 18 hours?

122
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:26,724
Go on, enjoy.

123
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,643
With the Vicodin and the wine
I could sleep anywhere.

124
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,151
Thank you.

125
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,574
We should put her back
on the scopolamine patch.

126
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,035
She can't wear
motion sickness patches
for the rest of her life.

127
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:49,621
No, but if it does relive
her symptoms
it'll narrow down our search.

128
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,124
Anything else
you two guys wanna agree on?

129
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,500
You have a problem
with us agreeing?

130
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,502
No, I have a problem
with the other thing
you're doing,

131
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:57,338
which makes me question
your motive for agreeing.

132
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,089
I'll put her
back on the patch.
What else?

133
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:00,758
It's gotta be something
neurological.

134
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,593
We should do a CT,
look for a brain tumor.

135
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,386
Could also be an allergy
or something environmental.

136
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,387
We should check her home.

137
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:07,848
Bit more likely she got
sick in Caracas
than in New Jersey.

138
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:10,225
Right, I forgot.
There are no toxins in the US.

139
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,394
I think I'm starting to
feel sorry for House.

140
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:15,648
Get a tox screen, chem-20,
STD panel, blood cultures.

141
00:09:15,731 --> 00:09:18,067
Then you run a CT
and you check her house.

142
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:20,819
Please.

143
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:27,618
Not funny.

144
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,994
Wasn't supposed
to be funny ha-ha.

145
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:32,122
Fever, headache,
severe abdominal pain,

146
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,375
and a rash
all over his lower back.

147
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,335
It's serious.
Maybe contagious.

148
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:40,005
We just attended a symposium
on pandemics

149
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,674
and you run right into one
on the flight home.

150
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:42,716
Talk about a small world.

151
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,801
If it's meningococcus,

152
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:47,680
half the passengers on this
plane could get infected and
die before we reach New York.

153
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:49,306
Is someone sick?
No.

154
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,226
Someone has a hangover.

155
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:55,020
He had a snootload
of Bloody Marys before dinner.

156
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,940
Watch the movie.

157
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:04,279
That booze did not
give him the rash.
It is textbook meningococcus.

158
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:07,032
It's also textbook
allergic reaction to pollen,

159
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,411
peanuts, and the semen-stained
polyester blanket
he's lying on.

160
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:12,538
Mr. Peng's throwing up again.

161
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:13,956
We have to turn around.

162
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:15,916
What? Why do we have to...

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,710
We don't. You misunderstood.

164
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:20,295
Dr. Cuddy just meant
that he might
feel less nauseous

165
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,006
if he was facing
in a different direction.

166
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,966
She didn't mean to panic
a planeload of people.

167
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:25,926
We're about to head
over the North Pole.

168
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,804
We don't turn back now,
the next ER's 15 hours away.

169
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:30,889
He'll be fine.
I'm a doctor, too.

170
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,016
You haven't examined him.

171
00:10:32,057 --> 00:10:35,144
Korean male, mid 30s,
5'9", 160, bald,

172
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:38,188
scar on the right side
of his jaw, medic alert
bracelet on his left wrist

173
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:40,649
indicating that
he's allergic to,
at least, penicillin.

174
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,777
Without any way to do an LP
or rule out meningococcus,

175
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:45,487
our only choice
is to assume the worst.

176
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:46,739
Good point.

177
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,659
On the other hand, I am
a board-certified specialist
in infectious disease.

178
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:53,329
She assigns parking spaces.

179
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:57,750
Please let me know
if he gets any worse.

180
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:15,934
Think we should feed the cat?

181
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:17,019
Bowl's full.

182
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,522
If he wants it, he can get it.
Cadmium yellow?

183
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:23,150
Heavy metal poisoning
would explain the
ataxia and the seizures.

184
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,319
Not unless
she was painting
with her tongue.

185
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:26,904
Was Foreman right?

186
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:30,032
Did you agree with me
because of our relationship?

187
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:32,284
"Relationship"?
You know what I mean.

188
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:35,245
You mean because of
our lack of a relationship.

189
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:37,539
I mean, because
we're having sex.

190
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:39,333
Yes. Foreman's right.

191
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,460
I thought you were
completely wrong
about the medicine,

192
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:42,753
but agreed with you anyway

193
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:45,965
because I figured then
you'd do me
in some old lady's home.

194
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:48,300
Then well played.

195
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:52,304
Come on, we're supposed to be
looking for toxins.

196
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,183
We agreed
it was a brain tumor. What?

197
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,230
He's watching.

198
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:02,940
Haven't you had
anybody watch before?

199
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,127
Is that guy really sick?
No.

200
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,421
He's all better.
I don't believe you.

201
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,925
Look that way.
Why?

202
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,345
Because you're gonna throw up
and I don't want it on me.

203
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:46,817
I'll get some towels.

204
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:51,238
Give her a banana.
Monkey see, monkey barf.
You smell vomit...

205
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:59,121
Okay. Wasn't expecting that.

206
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:07,880
I need help.

207
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,381
Who doesn't?

208
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:10,674
I need someone to talk to.

209
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:18,140
Can you say, "Crikey, mate"?

210
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,184
Crikey, mate.
Perfect.

211
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,771
Now no matter what I say,
you agree with me, okay?

212
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:26,148
Okay.
Nicely done.

213
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:30,027
And you disagree
with everything I say.

214
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:32,071
Sorry. Not understanding.

215
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:33,572
That's close enough.

216
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:36,575
And you get morally outraged
at everything I say.

217
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:38,661
That's a permanent marker,
you know.

218
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,245
Wow.

219
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:41,955
You guys are good.

220
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:46,502
We are looking for
the simplest way
to explain these symptoms.

221
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:53,342
Organophosphate poisoning.
Some international flights
spray pesticides.

222
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:56,303
Could be.

223
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:57,972
Sorry, English not so nice.

224
00:13:58,472 --> 00:13:59,640
Is this a joke?

225
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,141
Just passed the halfway mark.

226
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:02,726
Can't turn around. Nice call.

227
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,936
No worries.

228
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,437
We think it's
pesticide poisoning.

229
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:06,897
We don't spray these flights.

230
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:08,023
Dramamine overdose.

231
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:09,233
CUDDY: Wouldn't
explain the fever.

232
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:11,318
Jet lag.
Wouldn't explain
the abdominal pain.

233
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:13,570
Deep vein thrombosis.
Wouldn't explain the nausea.

234
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,197
Food poisoning.
What was on the menu?

235
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,368
Steak and sea bass
in First Class. Fettuccine
and seafood kebabs in Economy.

236
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:21,578
Since when does food poisoning
cause a rash?

237
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,540
Sea bass, seafood kebabs?
He had the sea bass.

238
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,667
Please tell me
she had the kebabs.

239
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:28,460
I think so.

240
00:14:28,544 --> 00:14:29,795
Ciguatera poisoning.

241
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:32,339
It's an instant-onset toxin.

242
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:34,883
Symptoms include...
E. All of the above.

243
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:38,345
It's only found in
certain kinds of tropical
game fish such as...

244
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,014
Sea bass?

245
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:41,557
Make sure you get
a resume from him.

246
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,355
<i>Hello?
Excuse me.</i>

247
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:52,192
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a brief announcement
concerning your meals.</i>

248
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:54,820
<i>If you ate the sea bass
or the seafood kebabs,</i>

249
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,488
<i>you have ingested
a dangerous toxin.</i>

250
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:59,700
<i>However, if you proceed
to the restrooms
both on your left and right</i>

251
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:02,119
<i>at the rear of the plane
and vomit as soon as possible,</i>

252
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,580
<i>the toxic effect
should be minimal.
What?</i>

253
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,252
<i>Thank you, and have
a pleasant flight.</i>

254
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:14,381
Meningococcus makes
just as much sense.

255
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:15,633
I know.

256
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,019
What did you find?

257
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:28,979
Nothing in her house.
Big waste of time.

258
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:30,022
Medically.

259
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:31,774
CT was a complete waste.

260
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:34,109
She was negative for tumors,
her blood was negative
for drugs,

261
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:37,738
heavy metals,
tropical diseases,
food poisoning, and STDs.

262
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,907
Also no sign of
lead poisoning or sepsis.

263
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,285
Apparently Venezuelan
tattoo parlors
have standards after all.

264
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:44,912
Good to know.

265
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:46,664
We sure she's even sick?

266
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,499
Two more seizures
in the last two hours.

267
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,378
Which is slower than she was
having them before
you put the patch back on.

268
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:59,009
I'm an idiot. She's exposed
herself to so much crap
I just assumed it was a zebra.

269
00:15:59,843 --> 00:16:01,136
It's breast cancer.

270
00:16:01,178 --> 00:16:04,014
Since when is breast cancer
treatable by
motion sickness meds?

271
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:07,309
It's not. But the inflammation
caused by the paraneoplastic
syndrome

272
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:10,813
caused by the cancer
can be reduced
by anticholinergics.

273
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:19,697
Hey, here you go.

274
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,948
Is he gonna die?

275
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,995
We're doing all we can.
We don't know what's
wrong with him yet.

276
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:27,287
Am I gonna die?

277
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:28,455
No.

278
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:30,416
Here, chew on these.

279
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:40,843
Good news is all the pilots
are red meat men.

280
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:44,430
Although I was kind of
looking forward to
landing this puppy myself.

281
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:46,098
Peng's getting worse.

282
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,391
That makes sense.

283
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:49,810
First Class ate before Coach.

284
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,854
He digested more of his food
before he threw up.

285
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:55,357
Or you're wrong and we're
gonna start seeing
neurological symptoms soon.

286
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:57,818
Seizures, paralysis, ataxia.

287
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:01,488
We're not gonna see ataxia.

288
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,741
You're so sure you're right.
No.

289
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:07,911
It's just hard to show
clumsiness when you're lying
moaning in a fetal position.

290
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:14,835
Hey, stand up.

291
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:17,963
Does nobody
speak Korean on this flight?

292
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:19,131
I assumed you did.

293
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:21,133
I know how to ask him
if his sister's over 18,

294
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:22,301
I just don't think
that's gonna help.

295
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:25,804
Hey, stand up. Stand up.

296
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:30,392
Don't play the cripple card
with me.

297
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:52,539
Oh, hi. I'm leaving.

298
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:54,833
Work.

299
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:55,960
Okay.

300
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:58,003
Important client.
Sure.

301
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:05,511
Listen.

302
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,265
Are you close?

303
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,433
Why?

304
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:16,188
She needs a mammogram.

305
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:18,607
Oh, God.

306
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:23,070
I know I'm throwing
a lot at you. She just
has no family in town.

307
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:27,574
And I really think
she could use a friend
right now.

308
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,920
Okay. Put your hand here.

309
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,301
You don't have to stay.

310
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,721
No, it's no problem.

311
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:49,805
But why?

312
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:52,683
You don't even know me.

313
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,394
You gotta be scared.

314
00:18:58,063 --> 00:19:00,649
I almost hope
it's breast cancer.
No.

315
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,109
Then it wouldn't be my fault.

316
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,236
Whatever it is,
it's not your fault.

317
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:08,240
That's not true.
You can control things.

318
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:10,284
Not everything.

319
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:13,787
But you don't have to
take stupid risks.
I was being an idiot.

320
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:15,289
You were having fun.

321
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,293
You have regrets?

322
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:23,172
Yeah.

323
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:24,381
<i>CAMERON.: Robin?</i>

324
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:37,019
Hold still.

325
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:42,941
Good.

326
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:48,030
Okay, we're gonna get
just one more.
I'm sorry, I know it hurts.

327
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:49,531
It's not that.

328
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:53,869
It's my eye. My right eye.

329
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:56,664
I can't see.

330
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,211
It's definitely ataxia.
And it's definitely a rash.

331
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:05,714
You gonna look at it for five
more minutes before concluding
it's also definitely a leg?

332
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:06,799
Thin leg.

333
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,300
It's been in a cast.
So?

334
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:09,635
So it could be
radiation poisoning.

335
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:10,844
From a broken leg?

336
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:12,179
From the x-rays
they took of it.

337
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:13,555
He could break
every bone in his body

338
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,849
and still not have
enough x-rays to cause
radiation sickness.

339
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:19,186
Unless those x-rays
were performed in Wankoff,
North Korea,

340
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,772
by a third-grade dropout
with a 50-year-old imager.

341
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,565
Which accounts
for the absence of fur.

342
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,734
Radiation poisoning accounts
for all his symptoms.

343
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:29,321
I have hair.
I haven't had an x-ray since
I got my teeth whitened.

344
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:30,864
You're pregnant.

345
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:31,949
I'm what?

346
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:34,952
Explains the nausea,
abdominal pains, fever,

347
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,288
and why you're stuffing
your 36Cs into a 34B bra.

348
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:39,498
CUDDY: And her rash?

349
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,500
PUPPPs. Common pregnancy rash.

350
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,501
I can't be pregnant.

351
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:43,794
You a virgin?

352
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:44,837
No, but...

353
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,422
You're pregnant. Mazel tov.

354
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:48,549
Let's get him into the chair.

355
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:51,635
Two different diagnoses.

356
00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:53,387
I thought you didn't
believe in coincidences.

357
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,139
I believe in statistics.

358
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:59,184
Two hundred passengers
on the plane,
10 should be gay,

359
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:02,730
two should be with child,
and one should be
incredibly annoying

360
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:04,648
with an extra ass chromosome.
House.

361
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:07,818
Get him some iodized salt
to protect his thyroid.
I'm going back...

362
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,944
House.

363
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:11,947
You're wrong.

364
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:33,552
I said we should have
turned back. You should
have listened to me.

365
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:35,304
Now we're eight miles
over the Arctic...

366
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:38,098
I'm trying to listen
to you now, so shut up.

367
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:42,102
Heart's fine.

368
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,897
Breasts are firm.

369
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,065
Is it contagious?

370
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:47,983
A lot of the passengers
are scared.

371
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:49,276
Tell them there's
nothing to worry about.

372
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:51,987
Is there something
to worry about?
Yeah.

373
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:57,409
Tell them there's
nothing to worry about.
And get me a flashlight.

374
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:03,207
Cover your left eye with this.

375
00:22:13,092 --> 00:22:14,468
Photophobia.

376
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:17,513
Symptom of meningitis.
We need antibiotics.

377
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,848
I'll call down
to the pharmacy.

378
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:24,979
You're creeping me out.

379
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,188
Then get me a lab.

380
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:30,067
Pseudomonas smell yeasty,
staph smells musty,

381
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:33,112
and some liver disease
smell of ammonia.

382
00:22:33,862 --> 00:22:35,739
House. I'm not in heat.

383
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:39,702
Citrus-y on the nose
with a blush of
toasted coconut.

384
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:52,798
I need to get a better look
at your rash.

385
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,133
Use your imagination.

386
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:57,970
Fine, should I go with
Lifeguard Cuddy
or Mother Superior Cuddy?

387
00:22:58,012 --> 00:23:00,014
Three more passengers
are sick.

388
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:03,934
If we don't get drugs,
we're gonna have
a lot of dead passengers.

389
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:14,403
Blindness in her right eye
indicates it's not
breast cancer.

390
00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:15,571
It's likely neurological.

391
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:17,364
I just met her today.

392
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:29,752
You should go.

393
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,295
She needs someone here.

394
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:33,047
That's not your job.

395
00:23:55,194 --> 00:23:57,488
Please let me know
that she's okay.

396
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:04,787
It's just sex.

397
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,121
There's no such thing.

398
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:08,540
Other eye.

399
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:11,168
Are you saying women
can't separate the physical
from the emotional?

400
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:13,295
No one does it well,
women do it worse.

401
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:15,464
You just want us to stop
because you think
it's affecting...

402
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,007
Me. Yeah.

403
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,553
Polyspikes are over 01 and 02.

404
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:23,138
That's her left eye.

405
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:25,265
Burst suppression
on every lead.

406
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,561
Fran?

407
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:34,650
She's comatose.

408
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:40,614
HOUSE: Nothing. Nothing.

409
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:42,241
Nothing.

410
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:44,910
Come on, nobody has no meds!

411
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:50,082
Excuse me.
Open your mouth.

412
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,460
Where's the acyclovir?

413
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:54,837
I'm not on any meds.

414
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,007
Well, you better get some.
You've got herpes.

415
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:10,811
What do you know?
He's got some.
This must be your lucky day.

416
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:14,481
This is for real.
People are sick.

417
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,485
Some of us will be
deplaning in body bags
unless you cough up.

418
00:25:19,028 --> 00:25:21,613
MAN: Here. Over here.
Thank you. Thank you.

419
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:23,949
Thank you.

420
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:26,952
God bless you.

421
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:29,997
Her brain is shutting down
because of
intracranial pressure.

422
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,248
Or her nerves are dying.

423
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:32,666
Because of
the increased pressure.

424
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,751
She has a bleed in her brain.

425
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:34,960
You said the CT showed...

426
00:25:35,044 --> 00:25:37,921
No tumors. But if she has
an AVM leading to
a cerebral hemorrhage,

427
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:40,090
we could've missed it.
She needs a burr hole
to relieve...

428
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:44,136
You wanna drill into her brain
because of an invisible bleed
the CT couldn't see?

429
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:46,555
We should do an LP
to confirm the presence
of red blood cells.

430
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,974
And her brain herniates
and then she dies.

431
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:50,976
Right. Better to kill her
in the OR.

432
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,186
Chase, what do you think?

433
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:53,687
Here's a cliffhanger.

434
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:59,526
I think it would help to know
what she has before we
start digging into her brain.

435
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,281
Might be better to
play it safe to start.
Do an LP.

436
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:07,826
Sex better be damn good.

437
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:18,253
Lot of apples,
not many candy bars.

438
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:19,630
Any antibiotics?

439
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:22,091
Three caps of Augmentin.

440
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:23,300
For six patients.

441
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,512
Give them to Peng.

442
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:28,013
He's allergic to penicillin.

443
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:30,099
The First Aid kit
has two epi pens.

444
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,559
If he has a severe reaction,
10 epi pens won't save him.

445
00:26:32,643 --> 00:26:34,812
You take the pills.
He's worse.

446
00:26:34,853 --> 00:26:36,230
He's a guy who doesn't
speak English.

447
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:37,564
Give him the meds.

448
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:41,110
If it's not meningitis,
we're risking his life and
flushing meds down the toilet.

449
00:26:41,193 --> 00:26:44,488
Then do an LP on him.
If it's clear, you win.

450
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:49,076
If it's cloudy he gets
the Augmentin.
And we risk a reaction.

451
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,539
Sounds like a plan.
All except for the part where
we don't have an LP needle.

452
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,834
And the shaking of the plane
means I'll probably pierce
his spinal cord

453
00:26:56,917 --> 00:27:00,713
and cripple him for life.
But, I mean,
it totally sounds like a plan.

454
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:06,510
You're right. Let him die.
Give me the meds.

455
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:26,840
Got it.
Damn.

456
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,426
What is it?

457
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:31,512
Shut up. Don't get hysterical.

458
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:33,722
Just tell me
what the hell it is.

459
00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:36,809
House. We should have
turned back.

460
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:39,019
We should have turned back.

461
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:41,563
House.

462
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:48,445
Hold this.

463
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,537
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

464
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,457
<i>we have a passenger with
a confirmed case
of bacterial meningitis.</i>

465
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:04,670
<i>Unless we land
as soon as possible, the
passenger will not survive.</i>

466
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,923
<i>It's very likely that
some of you have been
infected as well.</i>

467
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:12,803
<i>As soon as you start feeling
symptoms, we need to isolate
you in First Class cabin.</i>

468
00:29:12,845 --> 00:29:15,639
<i>Fever, rash, nausea,</i>

469
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:20,102
<i>and in the late stages
tremor in the left hand.</i>

470
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:25,107
I've got that.
Oh, God.

471
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,822
What do we do?
WOMAN: It's really bad.

472
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:33,407
Break out the bubbly.

473
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:35,492
Yo, listen up.

474
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:42,875
<i>The bad news is, you have
an illness. The good news is
it's not meningitis.</i>

475
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:47,087
<i>It's not fatal,
it's just embarrassing.</i>

476
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:50,507
<i>It's conversion disorder,
more commonly known
as mass hysteria.</i>

477
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:55,179
<i>It happens often in
high-anxiety situations,
especially to women.</i>

478
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,266
<i>I know it sounds sexist,
but science says you're weak
and soft. What can I do?</i>

479
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,268
CUDDY: House, you're wrong.

480
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,603
Look at my hand.

481
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:04,521
Yeah. Look at her hand.

482
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:06,940
Shaking left hand.
What is that a symptom of?

483
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,610
Not meningitis. It's basically
a symptom of nothing.

484
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:11,987
I put the idea
into their heads
and watched it happen.

485
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,948
Same thing Peng cruelly did
with the puking and the rash.

486
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:16,283
The rash is in my head?

487
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:18,327
Your mind controls your body.

488
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,829
If it thinks you're sick,
it makes you sick.

489
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,415
It just started.

490
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:28,504
<i>If you'll all just calm down,
your symptoms
will soon go away.</i>

491
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:30,047
<i>And to facilitate
this process,</i>

492
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,176
<i>your flight crew will move
through the cabin with
a complimentary bar service.</i>

493
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:37,471
<i>Thank you and, as always,
have a pleasant flight.</i>

494
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:47,398
Still feel like puking?
No.

495
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,619
How did you know?

496
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:01,787
LP was negative.

497
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:05,207
I came up with
an alternate theory
and I tested it.

498
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,878
Couldn't have done it
without you. Rage is
a symptom of mass hysteria.

499
00:31:10,254 --> 00:31:14,216
Just one more thing
to clean up. Peng set off
the mass hysteria.

500
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:16,719
What set off Peng?

501
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:21,390
He really is dying.
Yeah.

502
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:23,767
I haven't the
faintest idea why.

503
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:35,154
What's extension pasturing?

504
00:31:35,237 --> 00:31:38,615
It's when you're molested
by a priest's cousin.

505
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:43,454
Do we really need these three?

506
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:45,039
Worried they'll make you
look bad?

507
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,542
Could be symptomatic
of head trauma,
cerebral infarction,

508
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:51,754
or intracranial hemorrhage.
Thoughts?

509
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:53,380
How long until we land?

510
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,465
Too long to wait.

511
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:56,884
His head's as smooth
as a baby's bottom, no bumps.

512
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:58,218
So I think we can
rule out head trauma.

513
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,430
But you gotta choose between
what's left, a clog or a leak?

514
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:03,140
You're talking of toilet?

515
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:05,809
House, is this
actually helpful?

516
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:08,228
Not so far.

517
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:11,023
What about syphilis?

518
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:14,652
Well, first of all, he
apparently speaks a language
no one else speaks,

519
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:16,987
which makes talking up
the ladies a little rough.

520
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:18,155
We're flying out of Singapore.

521
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:21,742
If he has a credit card
and a condom,
he can get anything he wants.

522
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:24,912
What?

523
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:27,456
Condoms.

524
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:33,921
He has focal limb paralysis.

525
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:36,173
His legs got paralyzed
by a condom?

526
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,716
No, by cocaine.

527
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,259
It was inside the condom.

528
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:41,887
It's now spreading
through his digestive tract.

529
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:43,847
You think he's a mule.

530
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:45,474
I think he's a jackass.

531
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:48,560
We're gonna have to operate.
Cool!

532
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,749
They're gonna kill her.
We were wrong.

533
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,668
Which means Foreman was right.

534
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:17,339
Maybe Foreman's
right about us, too. Maybe
we should just stop all this.

535
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:18,674
I mean, if it's
affecting our jobs.

536
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,592
It's not affecting our jobs.

537
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:24,805
We had sex in a patient's
bedroom. A bedroom
we were examining for toxins.

538
00:33:24,888 --> 00:33:26,682
Yeah, our judgment's right
on the mark.

539
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:29,727
All right. No more sex
in patient's homes, no more
sex with cats watching.

540
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:32,187
Anywhere else you wanna
cross off the list?

541
00:33:32,688 --> 00:33:34,356
The bowl.
What?

542
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:38,027
Has she eaten
since she's been here?

543
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,778
She's been sick
since she's been here.

544
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,613
What if it's a symptom?
Well, why would you think...

545
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:43,324
The bowl was full.

546
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:57,421
You're gonna need to
hold him down.
He's not gonna like this.

547
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:01,091
Do you really think
he's a mule?

548
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:02,468
Fits the symptoms.

549
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:05,596
You sure he's not contagious?

550
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:06,722
Pretty much.

551
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:09,600
You can't be pretty much sure.
Means you're not sure.

552
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:11,310
Oh, aren't you clever?

553
00:34:13,604 --> 00:34:14,855
Come on.

554
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,859
I know you're pretty much
unconscious,

555
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:22,321
but as has been pointed out
to me, pretty much
doesn't mean squat.

556
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,011
Okay, hold him tight.

557
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:31,849
The faster we do this,
the less likely he is
to die of shock.

558
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:42,067
Tighter.

559
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:52,036
Sorry.
Do that again.

560
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:55,205
Ease off and then press down.

561
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:18,437
Pressure on his joints
relieves his pain.

562
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,564
Okay.
Wrong again.

563
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:23,108
Where's his wallet?

564
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:26,797
Scuba certification card.

565
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:31,343
Big deal. I have one of these.
Yeah.

566
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:35,973
But do you also have a receipt
from Tekong's Scuba Rental
dated yesterday?

567
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:41,186
Tell the Captain to
drop as low as he can,
under 5,000 feet.

568
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,480
We're at 38,000...
Peng's got the bends.

569
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:44,606
He went diving yesterday.

570
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,443
Like an idiot,
he surfaced too quickly,
and like a bigger idiot,

571
00:37:47,484 --> 00:37:50,612
he boarded a flight which is
pressurized to 8,000 feet
above sea level.

572
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:52,197
Low pressure is killing him.

573
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:55,993
Tell the pilot to dive until
we can club baby seals
out of the window.

574
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,454
And get him some oxygen.

575
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:13,177
Fifty years ago, it was
one estate. The two homes
shared an electrical system.

576
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,262
Unfortunately,
the exterminator
didn't know that,

577
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:17,056
so when they fumigated
next door,

578
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:19,767
the poison gas flowed
through the old pipe
and into your house.

579
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,811
The scopolamine patch
was masking the effects
of the poison.

580
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:26,982
You'll have to stay here
for a few more days, but
after that you should be fine.

581
00:38:28,734 --> 00:38:30,361
I'm sorry about your cat.

582
00:38:31,236 --> 00:38:32,446
And your hair.

583
00:38:34,406 --> 00:38:37,368
For 12 years, Harrington
never left the property.

584
00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:42,122
I thought I was being punished
for going away,

585
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:48,420
but really I was being
punished for coming home.

586
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:16,532
Thank you.
I saved your life. You owe me.

587
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:17,574
I wasn't sick.

588
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,785
But you didn't know that.
You owe me.

589
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:21,245
I know it now.

590
00:39:21,578 --> 00:39:25,749
Your mind convinced your body
to get a rash, photophobia,
vomit.

591
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:29,670
How do you know it wouldn't
have shut down your cold,
cold heart next?

592
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:33,799
I don't owe you.

593
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,469
You're mean.

594
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:42,349
That's how I compensate
for being weak and soft.

595
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:49,231
I just wanted to
say thank you.

596
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:50,816
You're extremely welcome.

597
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:52,526
And I'm in New York
every Monday.

598
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,237
Are you handicap accessible?

599
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,625
Hi, Robin?

600
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,462
This is Dr. Wilson.

601
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:14,214
Fran's doctor. James.

602
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:20,638
It was a toxin.
We caught it in time,
and she's gonna be fine.

603
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:23,307
Yeah, it is.

604
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:31,982
Listen, I was just wondering
if you were coming back in
again to visit.

605
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,611
Nice catch.

606
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:36,654
Thanks.

607
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:38,030
Think even House
would be impressed.

608
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:39,740
I don't know about that.

609
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:41,784
Any idea how
you wanna celebrate?

610
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:45,120
What?

611
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:47,498
I want more.

612
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,917
I thought
you were getting a little
worn out by...

613
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,752
No, that's not what I meant.

614
00:40:52,962 --> 00:40:54,046
I know.

615
00:40:54,463 --> 00:40:58,133
I was just hoping you'd
take the hint and pretend
you never said that.

616
00:40:58,884 --> 00:41:01,011
I want this to be
more than it is.

617
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:02,721
I thought we were clear.

618
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:04,807
In the beginning,
but you can't tell me...

619
00:41:04,848 --> 00:41:08,018
Yes, I can. And I don't.

620
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,940
It was fun. That's it.

621
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:18,737
And now it's over.
