1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,280
Hey. Thanks.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,160
No, no, no... Here.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,160
You got this whole thing
wrong, Em.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,640
It's the rock star that's
supposed to be late, not
the rock-star photographer.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,720
Sorry. Morning sickness.
Touch the belly.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,840
It's the first time
I've been asked to do that.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,360
Come on. It's good luck.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,840
Okay.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,560
Hit the Kinos behind the drop.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,400
So what do you think?

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,120
I think people
aren't gonna get it.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,320
Come on.
"All-American Rejects."

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,880
Juxtaposing a classic image
of Americana with
modern pop culture youth.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,120
Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
Everyone loves
a good juxtaposition.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,160
My fans were born in the '90s.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,640
You know what?
You do this picture,
you'll gain 40 years of fans.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,280
Yeah?
Yeah.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,600
I love the Rockwell thing.
I thought so.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,440
Okay. Kill the house lights.
Let's go!

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,200
Hang on. Hey, who's in charge
of the backdrop?

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,800
Naomi?
Yeah?

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,800
What's wrong with it?

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,360
Well, the words are
completely jumbled.

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,920
What, you can read that?

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,440
Of course.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,040
You okay?
No. Oh, God.

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,000
I could be having a...

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,360
What's the mnemonic?

30
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,280
"F" is for face.
Is my smile crooked?

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,520
What are you doing?

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,080
"A" is for arms.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,200
Arms.

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,520
You should really sit down.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,040
Can someone
get her some water?

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,520
"S" is speech.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm slurring? I'm slurring?

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,360
"F-A-S-T."

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,680
"T" is for time.

40
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,080
Hurry. Somebody, call 911.
Tell them I'm having a stroke.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,800
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,720
My boss says you're important.

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
Personally I don't get
what's so hard about

44
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,520
making Scarlett Johansson
look pretty.

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
Arms out in front of you.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,280
Palms up like
you're holding a pizza.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,120
Close your eyes.

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,360
It's so easy you should
consider a career change.

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,920
Probably make
a lot more money.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,320
Dr. Mackman tell you
the clot was clear?

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,480
Yes.

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,480
And he said that you
and the fetus are fine?

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,600
Yeah.

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,720
He didn't mention
your pronator drift?

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,520
What's that mean?

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Means Mackman is an idiot.

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,520
May I?
Yeah.

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,240
So,

59
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
you take thousands
of photos of someone,

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,680
but only one has to look good.

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,960
Kind of the opposite
of my business.

62
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,400
It's not about looking good.

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,520
People are always
hiding things.

64
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,880
I just keep shooting
until I can see what's
really inside them.

65
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
My eyes okay?

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,080
Eyes are gorgeous.

67
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,200
The vessels don't look so hot.

68
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,840
Microaneurysms predict
further strokes.

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,000
This is gonna happen again?

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,520
Unless I can figure out
the underlying cause.

71
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,280
Puff up your cheeks.

72
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
You should be able to
keep the air in. Means there's
weakness around the mouth.

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
So where'd you learn
to self-diagnose a stroke?

74
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,560
Oh, my baby's biological
father is a neurologist.

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,240
He once told me the FAST
mnemonic could
save my life one day. So...

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,720
Interesting pet name.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,960
Most people go with
"husband" or "pookie."

78
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,560
He's gay.

79
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,360
Just a sperm donor.
So when you...

80
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,080
You turned him
for a night?

81
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,840
Just straight for one date?

82
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,680
Okay.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,520
He took a magazine and a cup
into my bathroom.

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,400
A man after my own heart.

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,280
Different magazine obviously.

86
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,080
I'm rescinding Mackman's
discharge order.

87
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,200
My lackeys will be in
to do some tests,

88
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,080
take some more blood
and empty your catheter bag.

89
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,360
Not a moment you'll
want to cherish.

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,440
This is definitely different.

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,560
It looks almost like...

92
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,400
He's caring.

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,360
Find anything else
in the patient's folder?
Like a diagnosis?

94
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,680
Urinalysis revealed
excessive protein
and red blood cells.

95
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,320
Chem panel showed
a creatinine level over 2.5.

96
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,800
So first she strokes,
now her kidneys
are shutting down. Why?

97
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,640
Ultrasound showed
no tumors or stones.

98
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,320
No signs of fetal distress.
No urinary tract obstructions.

99
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
BP is fine. No pre-eclampsia.

100
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,360
Any of you guys
ever been to the Galápagos?

101
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
Was our patient there?

102
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,680
Dengue fever, avian pox,
even West Nile.

103
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,800
No.

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,440
I'm looking for
a vacation spot.

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,680
That mean we get vacation?

106
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,240
How would that differ
from your current status?

107
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,560
You're gonna do what? Relax?

108
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
Visiting family.

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,160
My uncle's a giant turtle.

110
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
What if the kidney failure
came first?

111
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
Kidneys could've
caused the stroke
not the other way around.

112
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
Kidneys don't often
get stuck in the brain.

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
I'm saying it threw a clot.

114
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,040
Early symptoms
of kidney failure are nausea,
vomiting, ankle swelling.

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,640
She would've mistaken it
for morning sickness.

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
Heart's way more likely
to throw a clot than a kidney.

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Echo was normal.
The history indicates
no sign of cardiac problems.

118
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,160
No, but if one were to read
the history closely,

119
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
one would notice
that she had six cases
of strep.

120
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,400
In her throat.
That's the one about
10 inches above her heart.

121
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
Let me rephrase,
six cases of untreated strep.

122
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,440
She was
prescribed antibiotics.

123
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,640
No one takes them all.

124
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,760
They stop when they
start feeling better.
All strep is untreated strep.

125
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,360
What happens when
strep goes untreated?

126
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,640
Leads to rheumatic fever.

127
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,960
Which leads to... Cameron?

128
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,160
Mitral valve stenosis.

129
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,080
Which is a thickening
in the valve of the... Kidney?

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,200
No.

131
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
The kidney doesn't have
a mitral valve.

132
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
We'll go look at her heart.

133
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,960
Be easy to find.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,400
It's the big red pumping thing
about 10 inches
below her throat.

135
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,560
That was weird.

136
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,680
He was the way he always is.

137
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,160
Which is weird.

138
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,240
Very still, Emma.
Sorry.

139
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,480
No problem.

140
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,440
He caught us with your hand
up my shirt. He's gotta have
a reaction to that.

141
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,920
You think that's what
the vacation is?

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,960
Yes.

143
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,360
The pain of losing you
is obviously forcing him away.

144
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,800
Coronal slice appears normal.

145
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,920
There's no way House
just lets this slide.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,480
He's gotta be
planning something.

147
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Maybe he just
doesn't give a crap.

148
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,840
Sagittal slice is clean.

149
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,440
You think he just
stumbled into that closet?

150
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,640
He knew we were there
and he wanted us to know
that he knew.

151
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
Or you wanted him to know.

152
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,400
Now he does and you're annoyed
because he doesn't care.

153
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,840
Right there.

154
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,880
Trans-axial slice.
Calcified mitral valve.
Barely.

155
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,600
That's not big enough
to throw a clot.

156
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,880
Obviously it is,
because it did.

157
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,240
House was right.

158
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,440
A valve in your heart
is narrowed.

159
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,160
It caused the clot
which lead to your stroke,

160
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,640
and the reduced circulation
caused the problem
with your kidneys.

161
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,240
And this will fix it?

162
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,520
The balloon will
force the valve back open
and you'll be fine.

163
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,120
EMMA: Can we do this without
a sedative?

164
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,040
It's very mild.
There really is no risk
to the fetus.

165
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,640
We'll monitor your baby's
heart rate separately.

166
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,920
We won't allow it to
decrease anywhere
near dangerous levels.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,080
Thank you.

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,200
You're both gonna be fine.

169
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,480
Go ahead, Dr. Cameron.

170
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Listen to that heartbeat.
It sounds so...

171
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,440
Start threading the catheter.

172
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,040
No, I don't want a layover
in Frankfurt, Taipei,
Singapore or London, Ontario.

173
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,400
That's why I asked
for a direct flight to
Phnom Penh.

174
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,680
How hard is it to not land?
Does it matter what I answer?

175
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,080
Well, then fine.
I'd be delighted to hold.

176
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,120
What's new?
Can you tell Cuddy
to stop interfering?

177
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,360
It's her job. What's new?

178
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,840
Good news is
Emma's heart is fixed.

179
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,080
Bad news is it's not her
underlying problem.
Her kidneys are still failing.

180
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,040
You're vacationing
in Cambodia?

181
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,040
You gonna unwind
in the Killing Fields?
Nope.

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,880
Gonna catch me
a fish this big.

183
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
Mekong giant catfish.
Weighs over 600 pounds.

184
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,920
Aren't those catfish
critically endangered?

185
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,600
That's why it's my last chance
to catch one.

186
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
<i>All of our operators
are currently...</i>

187
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,920
If the mitral valve had been
properly fixed the kidney
should be getting better,

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,480
which leads us to
the conclusion that you
screwed up the procedure.

189
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,880
Or you screwed up
the diagnosis.

190
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,560
The mitral valve thickening
was so insignificant

191
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,680
it probably wasn't the cause
of the kidneys or the stroke.

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
Probably never would've
been a problem.

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,520
She needs dialysis
and we need a new theory.

194
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,320
CHASE: There are only
a few possibilities.

195
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,480
Patient's pregnant,
could be pre-eclampsia.

196
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,840
We eliminated it
before because...

197
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,120
Re-check for proteinuria
and low platelets. What else?

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,240
Hypoperfusion.

199
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,560
The fetus is basically
a parasite stealing nutrients,
minerals, blood.

200
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,680
Put her on telemetry.

201
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,000
Or the pregnancy
is irrelevant.

202
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,680
Could be infection,
sepsis, HUSITTP.

203
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
CHASE: A cholesterol embolism
is just as likely.

204
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,000
Tiny particles of cholesterol
rain down, clog up the small
vessels of the kidneys.

205
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,200
Get a smear and ultrasound
her vessels for plaque.

206
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,840
That's it.
Has to be one of those five.

207
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,960
You know what would be
even better? If we'd narrow it
all the way down to one.

208
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,640
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

209
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,200
<i>We are experiencing
extremely high call volume.</i>

210
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,320
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

211
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
She's 0 for five.

212
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,360
Either the differential
was wrong or she's faking it.

213
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,560
Kidney failure has to be
precipitated by...

214
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,040
One of the five
we've already ruled out.

215
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,520
The body only has so many ways
of screwing with the kidneys.

216
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,120
The labs must be wrong.
We did the labs.

217
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,760
No one else had access.

218
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,280
That's not quite true.

219
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,760
You put all your patients
through this many tests
or just the important ones?

220
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,160
We wanted to explore
all possibilities.

221
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,560
And?

222
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
We've eliminated
all the possibilities.

223
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,640
You telling me I'm dying
and you have no idea why?

224
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
Your body is
functioning properly.

225
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
So why are my kidneys failing?

226
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,800
The other body isn't.

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,600
There's something wrong
with the fetus.

228
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,120
Welcome to the world
of maternal mirror syndrome.

229
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,040
Mom's body is like

230
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,160
an intricate
German metro system.

231
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,960
All the trains run on time.

232
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,000
When she gets pregnant,
it's like a new station
opening in Düsseldorf.

233
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,800
Bunch or rookies
running things.
Bound to be mistakes.

234
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,040
Kids play on the tracks,
get electrocuted.

235
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,440
Before you know it,
the trains are backed up
all the way to Berlin

236
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
and you've got
a bunch of angry Germans
with nowhere to go.

237
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
And we all know
that ain't good for the Jews.

238
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,640
Who are the Jews
in this metaphor?

239
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,600
A few things can happen
to a fetus in distress.

240
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,840
It can become a miscarriage,
stillbirth,

241
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,040
a very sick baby
or on rare occasion
a time bomb

242
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,200
that kills mom
while it's dying.

243
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,240
Good news is,
we fix the fetus,
mom gets better.

244
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,320
It's the diagnostic equivalent
of a two-for-one sale.

245
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,520
I have read the outcome
of mirror syndrome
is almost always unfavorable.

246
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,320
"Unfavorable."
Is that doctor speak
for "dead baby"?

247
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,040
You think she'll be less upset
if you phrase it nicely?

248
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,200
We can tell her the truth,
that she'll be fine

249
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,880
as soon as we diagnose
a person who weighs
about one pound.

250
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,520
Can't touch it,
can't ask where it hurts,
can't see it.

251
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,360
If only there existed
giant machines that could
look through human skin.

252
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,840
Mirror syndrome
has a limited number
of known causes.

253
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Tachyarrhythmia, fetal anemia,
placental chorioangioma.

254
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,640
All of which are fixable.

255
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,400
Which would be
un-unfavorable, right?

256
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
Could also be trisomy 13.

257
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,920
Ebstein's anomaly,
an aneurysm of Galen's vein.

258
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,480
And Dr. Storm Cloud
rained all over
the differential

259
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
and killed
the beautiful little baby.

260
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,440
Heart's easiest to see,
easiest to fix.
So let's start there.

261
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,920
When you did Mom's MRI,
did you get a look
at the fetus's heart?

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,280
It was in the range
but blurry. The fetus
was moving all over the place.

263
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,040
So we need another scan.
Yeah.

264
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,680
We'll just ask the fetus
to lie very, very still.

265
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,400
No need. I'm going to
paralyze it.

266
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,320
You wanna paralyze
Emma Sloan's baby?

267
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,320
Let me guess. Cameron?

268
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Cameron and Chase
both had their concerns.

269
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,040
No, Cameron had concerns.

270
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,120
Chase just agreed with her

271
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,040
because he didn't want to lose
his all-access pass
to her love rug.

272
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,320
They're sleeping together?

273
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,520
If by "sleeping together"
you mean having sex
in the janitor's closet.

274
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,680
Here?

275
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
No, the janitor's closet
at the local high school.

276
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,000
Go, Tiger Cats!

277
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,920
Do you have one of those
camera phones? 'Cause I got
a MySpace account.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I will deal with them
after I deal with you.

279
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,640
Oh, come on.
Let's gossip some more.

280
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,280
I'm sure she's into bondage.

281
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,640
Paralyzing a one-pound baby
risks damaging...

282
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,000
Not paralyzing the thing
risks not getting
a clean MRI of its heart,

283
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,840
which we need to
save its life, which we need
to do to save Emma's life.

284
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,200
You're gonna need to
get her consent.

285
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,880
Well, that shouldn't be
too hard.

286
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,360
"Sign here or you
and your baby both die."

287
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,880
I'm going with you.

288
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,040
Oh, good.

289
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,760
You said sedation was risky.
This sounds insane.

290
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,680
The injection goes into
the umbilical cord.

291
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,080
The baby won't feel a thing.

292
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,880
Fetus.

293
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm lowering expectations.
It works here and on dates.

294
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,960
The benefits outweigh
the risks

295
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,720
and the paralytic will
wear off in an hour, okay?

296
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,800
Must be easier to hear
you might die
than your baby might die.

297
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,160
But if there's anyone
I would trust to save my baby,

298
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,640
it would be Dr. House.

299
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,200
Fetus.

300
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,960
Hold this.

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,960
Dr. Cameron.
The MRI results back?

302
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,480
The fetus's heart
is structurally sound.

303
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,640
The problem's
with the bladder.
It's four times normal size.

304
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,640
Let me see.

305
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,600
The bladder's so engorged
it's taking up
the whole torso,

306
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,080
squeezing
all the other organs.

307
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,480
There's no room
for the lungs to develop.

308
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,360
The baby has a lower
urinary tract obstruction.

309
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,000
We can fix that
by inserting a shunt.

310
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,200
I'll give Emma the news.

311
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,000
Are you taking over the case?

312
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,520
House won't care.
He has his diagnosis.

313
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,280
Doctor Cameron.

314
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,200
Dating Chase can only end
in one of two ways.

315
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,240
House told you?

316
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,560
You get married
and live happily ever after,

317
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,320
or somebody gets hurt
and you two
can't work together,

318
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,640
and I have to fire somebody.

319
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
I would hate to see
my personal life become
such a burden to you.

320
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,120
I'm telling you this
for your own good.

321
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,920
I assume you're gonna have
this same conversation
with Chase for his own good.

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,560
Chase isn't the one
that's gonna get hurt here.

323
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,560
There's only room for one
but I could skooch over.

324
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,600
My social life
is my social life.

325
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,920
Couldn't agree more.

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,200
What goes on in the privacy
of a janitor's closet
is nobody's business except...

327
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,160
She told me to end it.
Is that what you want?

328
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,920
I was actually hoping
she'd fire one of you.

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,160
What are you doing?

330
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,600
Trying to avoid
altitude sickness.

331
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,280
Couldn't score a direct flight
to Cambodia,

332
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,680
so I've decided to scale
Argentina's infamous
Mount Aconcagua.

333
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,440
Perfect except for the fact
that you can't walk.

334
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,560
There's a tribe of
Mocoví Indians who actually
carry the elders up...

335
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,920
You're insane.

336
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,560
I'm an insane genius.

337
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,840
I set the chamber
for low pressure
instead of high.

338
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,200
Thinner air builds up
the extra red blood cells,

339
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,520
creates new capillaries.

340
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,720
Few more days in here,
I can save myself six weeks
at base camp.

341
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,040
Where's my MRI?

342
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,000
There's a blockage
in the urinary tract.

343
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,000
Simple terms,
your baby can't pee.

344
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,560
His bladder is swollen
and it's crushing his lungs.

345
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,880
Can you fix it?

346
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,520
We can insert a small tube
in the baby's bladder

347
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,560
that makes the urine
come out straight through
his belly

348
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,280
for the duration
of the pregnancy.

349
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,440
The bladder decompresses
and the lungs will be able to
develop normally.

350
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,120
When the baby gets better,
you should get better.

351
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,240
First we just have to
do a test

352
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,000
to determine whether
the baby's kidneys
are functioning properly.

353
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,680
And what if they're not?

354
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,400
If they're already
too damaged, then there's
really nothing we can do.

355
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,480
If this doesn't work out
you can always try again.

356
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
I miscarried twice
when I was married.

357
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,440
After the divorce,
I tried in vitro like
four times before this.

358
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,040
I'm 42. Maybe it's
just not meant to be.

359
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,960
What are you doing?

360
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,400
You're trying to be me,
so I thought
I'd try to be you.

361
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,880
You don't have
the cleavage for it.

362
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,600
But I have a much tighter ass.

363
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,040
Think every day should be
naked Thursday
or is that an oxymoron?

364
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,320
Let me see the results
from the bladder tap.

365
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,120
They aren't back yet.

366
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,480
They're gonna be inconclusive.

367
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,160
You think my diagnosis
is wrong?

368
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,640
Fetus doesn't pee,
amniotic fluid should be low.

369
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,800
Mom's level is fine.

370
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,960
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

371
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,800
Could just mean
we caught the obstruction
early.

372
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,560
Either way your test
will be inconclusive.

373
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,560
The urine you've collected
has been sitting in that
fetus's bladder for weeks.

374
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,000
As my pappy always said,
"Stale pee is useless pee."

375
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,600
Fine. I'll do another tap.

376
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,720
Just as useless.

377
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,120
Old urine drops down
from the kidney
right after the first tap

378
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,200
'cause it's so backed up.

379
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,680
Bladder tap number three
will give you
the freshest pee.

380
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,360
That's when you'll find out
if this fetus has even
a fighting chance.

381
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,640
Thank you.

382
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,640
I'll run two more taps.

383
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,520
Since when does
the Dean of Medicine
run bladder taps?

384
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,880
She's an important patient.

385
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,200
Because she takes pictures
or because she's you?

386
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
Woman in her 40s, single,

387
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,320
using a turkey baster
as a last gasp at motherhood.

388
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,000
Maybe you want to
make sure she succeeds
so you'll still have hope.

389
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,680
You can't be a good doctor
if you're not objective.

390
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,920
It's your file.
I don't want it.

391
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Then why did you just
say all that stuff?

392
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,400
To humiliate you.

393
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,680
You're taking the case back.
I don't want it.

394
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,640
Your diagnosis is right.
I want to go on vacation.

395
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,240
You can go on vacation
after you've cured her.

396
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
CHASE: Good news.

397
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,520
The fetus's urine
had appropriate levels
of protein and electrolytes,

398
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
so its kidneys aren't damaged.

399
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,440
Oh, wow.

400
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,360
We're gonna put the shunt in.

401
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160
Your baby's lungs
should have more room to grow

402
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,560
and your symptoms
should go away.

403
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,400
But he'll still need surgery,
after he's born?

404
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,880
That's when we'll
remove the blockage
in the ureter.

405
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,360
You'll be the only mother
on the planet who appreciates
the value of a wet diaper.

406
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,040
Hey, could you hand me that?

407
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,480
I'm keeping
a visual memory book

408
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,920
of this entire surreal process
and this is the best part
of the story so far.

409
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,720
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks.

410
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,040
When'd you take this?

411
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,600
She did the
second bladder tap.

412
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,760
You should keep it.

413
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,440
Oh, I see her all day at work.
I don't need it.

414
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,800
Maybe you want to see her
after work.

415
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm right, right?

416
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,840
I saw the way you look at her.

417
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,800
Thanks.

418
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,920
The shunt is
in the right position.

419
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,760
Bladder is starting
to decompress.

420
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,960
No infection.

421
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,760
Did House say anything else?
About us?

422
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,560
I thought you didn't
care about his reaction.
Trying to make him jealous?

423
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,840
I like my job.

424
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,840
He can't fire you
just because we're together.

425
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,880
We're not "together,"
and House can do
whatever he wants.

426
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
How's my baby?
Doing just fine, Emma.

427
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
So are you.

428
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,720
My stomach's killing me.

429
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,280
That's not her stomach.

430
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,840
Can you open your eyes, Emma?
I just need to take a look.

431
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,120
What is it?

432
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,160
Emma's jaundiced.
Her liver's shutting down.

433
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,800
Figures.
Just booked my trip
to Johnston Strait.

434
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,760
I thought you were
climbing Mount Whatever
in Argentina.

435
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,440
Apparently I'd have to live
with the Mocoví Indians
for 20 years

436
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,240
before they'd consider me
an elder.

437
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,600
Decided to go kayaking
with orca instead.
No legs required.

438
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,800
Can't leave yet.
Liver failure puts her case
back into the unsolved pile.

439
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,920
Increased AST, ALT
and her bilirubin's
off the charts.

440
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,920
Even fetuses lie.

441
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,320
We diagnosed a lower
urinary tract obstruction
because we saw one.

442
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,680
What if that's not
the whole story?

443
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,240
What if the little bugger
is hiding something?

444
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,120
The real reason
for the mirror syndrome.

445
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,560
Have we looked under its bed?

446
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,760
We checked its diary?

447
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
If it's not GU,
could be the heart.

448
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,640
Hypoplastic
left heart syndrome.

449
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,320
There were no
structural problems.
The lungs.

450
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,160
We won't be able to
get a good look
until they develop.

451
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,120
It'll be weeks...
She's not gonna last weeks.

452
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
What do you want to do?

453
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,400
Maternal mirror syndrome
has one sure fire cure.

454
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,280
Deliver the fetus.

455
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
That's not viable at 21 weeks.
You'll kill the baby.

456
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,800
Fetus.
Semantics
make you feel better?

457
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Pretend it's not a person?

458
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,920
Can it play catch? Can it eat?

459
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,880
Can it take pretty pictures?

460
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
Who wants to tell her?

461
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,560
The swollen bladder
was not the only problem.

462
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,280
We can't leave it inside you.
We have to terminate.

463
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,160
Well, can't you deliver him?

464
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,280
Put him on a respiratory
machine till you
figure out what's wrong?

465
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,480
We can. And it won't matter.

466
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,280
The fetus is still at least
two weeks away
from being viable.

467
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,080
Well, I'll suffer through this
for two more weeks then.

468
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,640
You're on dialysis
for your kidneys.
Your kidneys can wait.

469
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,880
They don't make dialysis
for your liver.

470
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
You're not gonna make it
two more days.

471
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm not gonna let you
kill my baby.

472
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,920
It's killing you.

473
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm not having an abortion.

474
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,760
It's not a baby. It's a tumor.

475
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,800
I understand
dying for a cause.

476
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,960
Sacrificing your life so
your child might live. But
that's not the choice here.

477
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,400
Either it dies
or you both die.

478
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,360
Or you fix him
and we both live.

479
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,920
I can't fix it.

480
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,920
I'm scheduling a D&C.

481
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
I won't consent.

482
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,880
So I guess
you have two days
to figure it out.

483
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,080
Her kidneys are
almost irreparable.

484
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,240
She's developed severe DIC.
You have to force her
to terminate.

485
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,880
Did you give corticosteroids
to speed up the baby's
lung development?

486
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,520
No. I dropped an anvil
on its chest to prevent
lung development.

487
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,800
I'm trying to extinguish
the human race
one fetus at a time.

488
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,600
Give the lungs more time
to expand so you can
see inside them.

489
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,800
See if they're the problem.

490
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,680
My real patient is dying.

491
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,160
Very quickly. Like I wouldn't
advise her to buy
any green bananas.

492
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,280
The fetus is nothing more
than a parasite at this point.

493
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,760
Removing it
is an instant cure.

494
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,520
You're not gonna get Emma
to see it that way.

495
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,680
She's probably already
named the baby,

496
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,720
read him books,
had conversations with him.

497
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,360
See, you get it.
She'll listen to you.
No.

498
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,480
If you let this woman refuse
to terminate, you're helping
her commit suicide.

499
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,920
As her doctor
my recommendation is
against suicide.

500
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,360
If the baby had a doctor,

501
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,240
I think she would recommend
exhausting all possibilities
before taking its life.

502
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Then she'd be an idiot.

503
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,040
Too bad she's your boss!

504
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,640
What if our original
assumption is wrong?

505
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,920
It isn't.

506
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
If we assume
she doesn't have
mirror syndrome,

507
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,080
then terminating her pregnancy
isn't gonna
help her liver at all.

508
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,160
We eliminated
all other possibilities.

509
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,440
The fetus is hydropic
and in distress.

510
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,480
Emma's kidneys and liver
are failing.
The diagnosis is solid.

511
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,320
Wow! The ass-kisser
won't agree with you.

512
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,200
You must be even wronger
than I thought.

513
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,320
Fine.

514
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,160
Let's assume she had
mirror syndrome

515
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,920
but we fixed it when we fixed
the baby's bladder.

516
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,760
That means that
her failing liver would be
completely unrelated.

517
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,160
If it is, we can fix it and
we don't have to terminate.

518
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,120
So her theory is
that our patient's
liver problems

519
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,280
were just a giant coincidence.

520
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
It's not a surprising
coincidence.

521
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,760
Pregnant women
can develop liver problems.

522
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,520
If this is the case,
we can actually
do something here.

523
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,080
Don't you guys
think that's worth exploring?

524
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
would have the same symptoms.

525
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,560
Thank you.
Brownnoser.

526
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,520
Viral hepatitis,
HELLP syndrome.
Oh, look.

527
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,600
Sticking up
for your girlfriend.
Who says chivalry's dead?

528
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,280
He's not joking?

529
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,960
Be patient. She's going
through all of us. She'll get
that jungle fever eventually.

530
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm not going through anyone.
You love him?

531
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,960
This can probably wait until
after you biopsy Emma's liver,
right?

532
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,880
We can't.
Her platelets are too low.

533
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,440
Once we pierce her liver,
it'll be next to impossible
to stop the bleeding.

534
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,880
Come in from above.

535
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,840
Instead of going straight in
through her abdomen,

536
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,280
go in through the veins
in her neck.

537
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,120
Transjugular hepatic biopsy.

538
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,880
If the liver starts to bleed,
it'll bleed right back
into her own veins.

539
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,040
Why don't you start
your vacation now?

540
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,280
Threading the guide wire
through the right
internal jugular vein.

541
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,840
So, the sleep lab...

542
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,400
You and Cameron not sleeping.

543
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,920
How serious is it?

544
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,080
It's nothing.

545
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,520
She's only doing it
to make House jealous.

546
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,760
Then why are you doing it?
You kidding?

547
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,680
You're approaching
the inferior vena cava.
Slow down.

548
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,600
You better not hurt her.

549
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,720
She already has a big brother.
She does?

550
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,680
You obviously care
very deeply about her.

551
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,320
I'm not protecting her.
I'm protecting myself.

552
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,960
A heartbroken,
lovesick Cameron

553
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,560
would be even more unbearable
than she is now.

554
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,800
You're through
the hepatic vein.

555
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,280
(MACHINE BEEPING)
I'm firing the needle.

556
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,600
Heart rate and BP spiking.
Get that out of her.

557
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,360
Fetus's heart rate
just dropped to 50.

558
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,320
We've got contractions.
Pre-term labor.

559
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,160
Start a terbutaline drip!

560
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,520
We were able to control
the pre-term labor
with tocolytics.

561
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,440
The contractions
have subsided for now.

562
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,320
And the liver biopsy
was negative. This is
definitely mirror syndrome.

563
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,360
Her baby's doing this to her.

564
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,400
We're out of options.

565
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,080
Did the biopsy cause
the pre-term labor
or did it happen on its own?

566
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,320
It doesn't make a difference.

567
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,760
Pre-term labor
can be a new symptom.

568
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,400
New information gives us
new theories.
Isn't that how it works?

569
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
Not in this case.

570
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,920
Her body's trying to do
what you refuse to, get the
baby out and save itself.

571
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,160
Patient's transaminases
are 10 times normal.

572
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,040
Her liver is on the verge
of shutting down completely.

573
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,160
A torch test could...

574
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,000
We don't have time
for more tests.

575
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,160
We have to terminate
or she'll die.

576
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,160
Then let's work faster.

577
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,280
Medicine doesn't work faster
just because you
hope real hard.

578
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,320
But it could help to see
what the baby's been hiding.

579
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,280
The only organ we haven't
been able to look inside
is its lungs.

580
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,400
The problem must be in there.

581
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,240
We haven't been able to
see inside because
they're underdeveloped.

582
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,040
We've already got her
on corticosteroids, but it'll
take weeks for them...

583
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,960
Then let's drown them
in corticosteroids,
multiple courses.

584
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,080
Speed up their development.

585
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,000
Giving the baby more than one
course will suppress
adrenal gland function.

586
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,160
Have long-term adverse effects
on fetal organ development.

587
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,240
Worse than death?
Emma's already on tocolytics.

588
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,120
The combination could put her
into pulmonary edema.

589
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,480
You'll just kill her faster.

590
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,880
It's the only chance we have
to see inside those lungs.

591
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,920
We're just gonna have to
make the baby better faster
than we make Emma worse.

592
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,480
Come on! This is the kind
of thing House does every day.

593
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,160
House thought we should
terminate six hours ago.

594
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,680
I'll do it myself.

595
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,720
Anybody gonna stop her?

596
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,280
Stopping the madness
is her job.

597
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,720
Somebody's got to be
Cuddy's Cuddy.

598
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,560
Nurse!

599
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,760
Pulmonary edema?
Who tattled?
It doesn't matter.

600
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,720
There's a reason we don't give
multiple courses
of corticosteroids.

601
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,200
Gee, thanks.

602
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,520
It's time to terminate.

603
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,680
That's not what she wants.

604
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,920
Look at her.

605
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,160
She didn't want to be
an incubator for a dead baby,
but that's what you've done.

606
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,880
Either get me a laryngoscope
or get out!

607
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
You were right.

608
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,440
You were all right.

609
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,920
Now the mom's lungs
are shutting down.

610
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,800
She's dying faster
than the baby's lungs
are developing.

611
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,760
I had to stop
the corticosteroids.

612
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,480
Have you spoken to the family?

613
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,800
The only family she's got
is that baby.

614
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,320
Well, he's biased.

615
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,320
What do you think
House would do?

616
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,680
House wants to terminate.

617
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,880
I mean if he didn't.

618
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,640
If he shared my position,
what do you think he would do?

619
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,680
He wouldn't share your pain.

620
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,800
He'd be objective.

621
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,920
Right.

622
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,440
He would prioritize
his problems.

623
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,680
He'd terminate.

624
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,680
He wouldn't be afraid
of screwing with her lungs
if there was a bigger issue.

625
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,720
There is no bigger issue.

626
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,680
She needs her lungs.
Not right now.

627
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,560
She's already on a respirator.

628
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,000
The machine is
breathing for her.

629
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,560
I can do whatever
I want to her lungs.

630
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,520
If you're playing catch in
the living room and you break
your mother's vase,

631
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,920
you may as well
keep playing catch.
The vase is already broken.

632
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,400
Yeah, except that room
can't breathe
without that vase.

633
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,800
I'm putting her back on
corticosteroids.

634
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,720
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

635
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,240
It worked.
What worked?

636
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,000
I got the baby's lungs
to expand.

637
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,800
We should be able to figure...
Cab's on its way.

638
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,800
I have to finish packing.

639
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,400
I have a whole new
appreciation for what you do.

640
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,800
How hard it is to believe
when everyone around you

641
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,800
is telling you
that you're wrong.

642
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
Helps to know they're idiots.

643
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,240
Do you think I'm an idiot?

644
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,480
You're not objective.

645
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,680
But you're not an idiot.

646
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,800
These lungs are still
two weeks away
from being viable.

647
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,360
But big enough
for a diagnosis.

648
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,960
These tissue buds are new.

649
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,400
Could indicate
bronchopulmonary sequestration

650
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,240
or diaphragmatic eventration.

651
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,080
I was thinking bronchogenic
cyst or bronchial atresia.

652
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,880
Could be lung lesions, CCAM.

653
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,000
What about...

654
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,560
Move.

655
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,800
Thought you
started your vacation.

656
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,760
Somebody had to save
our boss's rotundous ass.

657
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,040
Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.

658
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,280
Small buds in the lungs
could indicate...
Thanks.

659
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,880
Got the multiple choice
all worked out.

660
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,080
Question is, how do we pick
between A, B, C, D,
and none of the above?

661
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,480
Portable MRI is in her room.
We could get a current image.

662
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,400
The fetal lungs are so tiny
the MRI won't give us
the detail we need.

663
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,440
What would we do
if this patient were
not just a tadpole?

664
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,920
Say it was an actual person.

665
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,240
He is a person.

666
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,920
Thanks for playing along.

667
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,680
Pretend it's
a one-pound adult.

668
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,360
Forget the mom,
forget the womb, the placenta.

669
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,840
How would we get a better look
at what's in the lungs?

670
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,120
Transesophageal echo.

671
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,440
Can't access his esophagus.

672
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,080
High resolution CT
could give us a clearer...

673
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,600
Too much radiation
for a one-pound person.

674
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,840
You can't just shoot
everything down, Chase.

675
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,120
You're not me. Collaborate.

676
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,520
A ventilation perfusion scan
would be next.

677
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,200
How do we get a fetus
to breathe in
a radioactive isotope, idiot?

678
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,440
If it were really a person
and we had no other options

679
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,080
we'd do an
exploratory surgery.

680
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,480
Cut into its chest
and have a look around.

681
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,760
Let's do that.

682
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,240
You're the one who insists
we treat it like a person.

683
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,200
I'll put it back
when I'm done.

684
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,560
Me again.

685
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,240
It's your friendly
neighborhood belly squirter.

686
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
We're gonna do
open fetal surgery.

687
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,360
Open the uterus,
cut out the fetus
so we can look around.

688
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,720
I know you can't talk so
I need you to look petrified
if you consent.

689
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
The umbilical cord
won't be cut.

690
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,560
During surgery, your body
will basically serve as
the baby's heartllung machine.

691
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,960
We find what's wrong
and we fix it.

692
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
If we can.

693
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,320
Don't lower expectations
if you want them
to do something.

694
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,400
She should know
what she's facing.

695
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
This is incredibly dangerous.

696
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,520
It risks both your lives.

697
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,720
The only reason why
we're suggesting

698
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,360
it is because there's
nothing else we can do.

699
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,440
You all here
for the fetal surgery?

700
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,520
'Cause we're
way over capacity.

701
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,520
Mind each other's
personal space.

702
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,800
There are sharp implements
in the room.

703
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,120
Like this one.

704
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,600
Uterus is fully exposed.

705
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,520
And we're in.

706
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,600
Start draining
the amniotic fluid.

707
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,680
Have you never sucked beer
out of the bottom of a keg?

708
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,920
Where'd you go to college?
Give me that.

709
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,320
Affix the pulse ox
to the palm.

710
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,960
House?

711
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,880
Sorry.

712
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,000
<i>Just realized
I forgot to TiVo Alien.</i>

713
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,720
Fetal heart rate good.
Stats are stable.

714
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,560
Position him for the incision.

715
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,080
I see three well-defined
lesions.

716
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,320
It's definitely CCAM.
I should be able to
resect them.

717
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,360
(MONITOR BEEPING)

718
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,880
It's the mom. She's in V-fib.

719
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,680
Charging.

720
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,440
Clear!
I'm clear.

721
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,840
Looks like asystole.
Paddling isn't
going to do anything.

722
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,200
It's fine V-fib.
I'm going again. Clear!

723
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,840
We're gonna lose them both.
Clamp!

724
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,080
The surgery's not
doing this to her.
The fetus is.

725
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,640
Step away, House.
I'm going again.

726
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,040
The only way to save her
is to cut away the anchor
holding her down.

727
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,600
You keep going,
you're gonna get electrocuted.

728
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,080
Clear!

729
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Going again. Clear!

730
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,720
(MONITOR BEEPING)

731
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,360
Heart rate's returning
to normal.

732
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,920
Continue with the lobectomy.

733
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,320
So my kidneys, liver and lungs
are all fine just like that?

734
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,680
Just like that.
That's amazing.

735
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,560
What's amazing
is how blonde your
baby's hair is.

736
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,080
My baby?

737
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,240
The thing in your belly
that tried to kill you.

738
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,520
You've never called him
a baby before.

739
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,000
Any pain?

740
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,600
Nothing I can't deal with.

741
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,160
You can only get out of bed
to pee, pooh or shower.

742
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,400
And absolutely no sex.
So stop flirting with me.

743
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,080
Sorry.

744
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,680
So this really worked?
He'll be normal?

745
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,000
Well, if you call
being born twice normal.

746
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,480
Hey, thank you.

747
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,000
Don't thank me.
I would've killed the kid.

748
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,200
Wanna grab a bite?
In a minute.

749
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Emma asked me to
bring up her camera.

750
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,760
I'll walk with you.

751
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,240
When'd she take
this picture of you?

752
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,240
You look so...

753
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,880
I'm smiling.

754
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,480
I have a nice smile.

755
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,760
No, I've never
seen you like this.

756
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,480
She got you to glow.

757
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,120
What were you doing?

758
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,720
What did she say to you?

759
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,520
I always glow.

760
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,280
House.

761
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,800
Need you to take
a look at something.

762
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,120
I'm off the clock.
Just open it.

763
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,880
A first-class ticket
to Vancouver Island.

764
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,680
Shoot! The wrong envelope.

765
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,280
I think it's great.
Yeah.

766
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,280
Who doesn't like Canadians?
It's big.

767
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,600
You're trying to have a life.
You're trying to
enjoy yourself.

768
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,440
You didn't need to apologize.

769
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,800
I'm not. I told you why I...

770
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,960
Screwed up.

771
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
I saved a life.
I saved two lives.

772
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,200
You

773
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,680
let your maternal instinct
get the best of you
and nearly kill two people.

774
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,320
Case like this, you terminate,
mom lives 10 times out of 10.

775
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
You do what you did

776
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,360
mom and baby both die
9.9 times out of 10.

777
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,080
Sometimes point one
is bigger than 9.9.

778
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,040
No, it's smaller.

779
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,720
Exactly 9.8 smaller.
Always is. Always will be.

780
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,960
Well, not for Emma.
And not for her son.

781
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,080
Now go away and be happy.
