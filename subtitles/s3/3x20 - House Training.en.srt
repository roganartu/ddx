1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
step around. Step around.
Come on. Gather around.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,280
We'll show you
a little way to make
a little easy money today.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,800
You understand
what I'm saying?
These are the blacks.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,720
Don't follow the blacks.
You wanna follow the queen.
Know why?

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,600
'Cause she's red
and that means she is hot.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,720
You gotta find the queen.
Find the queen.

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,920
The first of the day
is free to play.
Who wants to play?

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,320
You look interested, my man.
You wanna step on up?
Come on now.

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,000
Who wants to play?
Oh, what about you, sweetie?

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,040
You're cute.
Come on up.
All right.

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,440
Come on here and play.
Cute girls win money.
You look lucky.

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,560
Now, you look lucky.
Now, follow the queen.

13
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,720
Here we go,
ladies and gentlemen.
Follow the queen.

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Follow the queen.

15
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,120
Ain't no Helen Mirren,
but this queen is for you!

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,600
Which one? Which one?
Which one is it?
Which one is it?

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,680
It's right there.
Right there?

18
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,960
(WHOOPS)

19
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,320
Beginner's luck.
Beginner's luck.
I'll tell you what.

20
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,480
It takes a woman
to know a woman.

21
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,920
It takes a lady
to find a queen.

22
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,320
There you go...
Wanna double up?

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,720
All right.
All right,
we've got a chancer.

24
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,120
We got a chancer.
We got a chancer.

25
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,240
All right. Here we go.
Here we go.

26
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,560
All you gotta do
is find your queen.

27
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,440
You will not win again.
You will not win again.
All right.

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,480
Here we go. Here we go.
Find your queen.
Find your queen.

29
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,280
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?

30
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,720
Can you find her?

31
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,160
Right there.
This one? Oh, my...

32
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,600
She is killing me here.
Taking all my money.

33
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,560
Anybody else wanna get behind
the good-luck girl?

34
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,640
I can do it.

35
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,960
You can do it?
All right. You're next.

36
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,480
Just give me a chance
to recover and
get my money back

37
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,200
or else I'm gonna be out here
sleeping on the street.

38
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,400
Here we go.
All right? Ready?

39
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,880
This is the last time.
I'm not messing
with you no more.

40
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
You're taking
all my money, girl.

41
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
I'm not messing
with you no more.

42
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,640
Here we go. One more chance.
This is your last chance.

43
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,640
You're gonna follow
the queen, baby.

44
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,840
Follow the queen.
Where's she at?
Where's she at?

45
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,800
Just one time.
I'll show you one time
and there she is.

46
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,160
Boom. Boom. Boom.
Pick a card.

47
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,680
I can't decide.

48
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,600
What do you mean?
Just pick a card.
Just make a decision.

49
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,640
I can't decide.

50
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,840
Come on. Any card will do.
Left? Right? Center?

51
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
I don't know.

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,320
Do you want the right?
I don't know.

53
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,080
I...
The left?

54
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,640
The center?
I don't know. I...

55
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,960
Move out the way and just
let somebody else play then?

56
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,960
I can't decide. I can't.

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You wanna flip
a coin for it?

58
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,760
What's wrong with me?

59
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
MAN: Is she okay?

60
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,680
Scariest 30 seconds
of my life.

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,000
I couldn't do anything.

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
It's like I couldn't
move inside my head.

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,840
It's called abulia.

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,920
The inability to
make a decision
or exercise will.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,280
Is it going to happen again?

66
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,800
It's part of a TIA.
A transient ischemic attack.

67
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,040
Blood was cut off to a section
of your frontal lobe.

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,600
Is it like a stroke
or something?

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,600
A little.

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,360
What drugs have you
taken recently?

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,440
No drugs.

72
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,200
Toxins are
another possibility.

73
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,520
You might have been exposed
to something at work,
for instance.

74
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,400
No real job right now.

75
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,320
Exposure can build up
over time

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,760
and lie dormant for a while.

77
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,200
What was your last job?
Pet store.

78
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,520
Exotic pets?

79
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,840
Tropical fish.

80
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
And before that?

81
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,920
Unemployment.

82
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,920
And before that,

83
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,360
I sold subscriptions
on the phone.

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,400
And before that,
unemployment.

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,600
Before that,
I worked at Jeans Gone Wild.

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,360
Before that, unemployment.
Before that, I walked dogs.

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
And before that...

88
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,440
Loss of free will. I like it.

89
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,920
Maybe we can get
Thomas Aquinas
in for a consult.

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,920
What caused the TIA?

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
Arteries are clear.
No sign of a clot.

92
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,840
Could have dissolved.
Most likely came
from her heart.

93
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,960
We should do a bubble study.

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,480
Clots are unlikely
in a 28-year-old
who's not on the pill.

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
It's probably a vasospasm
caused by drugs.

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,880
I don't think so.
She goes from job to job.

97
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,160
Maybe there's some kind
of ADD here.

98
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,480
Help us pinpoint
where the neurological...

99
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,080
She goes from job to job
because she's a scam artist.

100
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,360
She works just long enough
to qualify for unemployment,

101
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,200
then gets fired
and gets high.

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,120
I still don't think
it's drugs.

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,440
Did you check
for infection?

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,920
LP showed nothing.
No fever.

105
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
White blood count is normal.

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,160
Could be toxic exposure.

107
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,080
You're the one always saying
it must be drugs.

108
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,400
You figure she's a minority,
she must be stoned?

109
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,360
You know that's what I...
She seems like a nice girl.

110
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,520
FOREMAN:
You haven't met her!

111
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,440
She was pregnant at 15,
dropped out of high school.

112
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,760
She's a real overachiever.

113
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,800
CHASE: Come on.
Cut her some slack.
Her baby died of SIDS.

114
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,200
This isn't some
romantic story

115
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,880
about a nice girl
scarred by tragedy.

116
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,200
She's a drug-using scam artist
scarred by tragedy.

117
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,800
On the other hand,
the tox screen just came back.

118
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,000
She's clean.

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,040
You're wasting my time.
He's wasting...

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,160
Second ex-Mrs. Wilson
want money?

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,480
I am no longer
paying alimony.

122
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,880
She wanted
her independence,

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,360
so she got her
realtor's license.

124
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,160
Market's doing badly.
She wants money.

125
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,480
Market's doing badly.

126
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,040
She's moving into a condo.

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,200
She wants...
She wants me
to take Hector.

128
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,800
Pool boy?

129
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Dog.

130
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,520
No longer interested.

131
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
We got him
on our honeymoon.

132
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,640
So I'm like
the other parent.

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120
But I can't take him.

134
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,120
My hotel doesn't allow dogs.
Besides, I'm always here.

135
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,040
I asked Cuddy
to a play Thursday.

136
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,520
(CHUCKLES)

137
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,440
Oh, you... Okay.

138
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,960
She said she was busy.

139
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,560
And you didn't believe her,
so you bribed a janitor,

140
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,880
broke into her computer,
checked her appointments...

141
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,680
I asked her as a test.

142
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,680
What would you have learned
if she'd said yes?

143
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,160
A lot about bondage.

144
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
She was busy for me
but not for you.

145
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
<i>She's not interested
in play qua play.</i>

146
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,920
She's interested in you.

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,440
No. I'm not getting
sucked into the vortex
of your insanity again.

148
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
Don't pass me
notes in class.

149
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,080
Don't tell me to
ask her to the prom.

150
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,640
You cannot
see her socially.

151
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,680
You're leading her on.

152
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,520
I'll consider that.
After I take her
to the Hockney exhibit.

153
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,400
On Thursday.

154
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,200
See, she is busy.
It's not a date.

155
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,000
She enjoyed the play.
I enjoyed her
enjoying the play.

156
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,720
The woman works hard.
It's nice to see her relax.

157
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,960
So all this enjoying
is an act of charity.

158
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,240
I'm keeping the receipts
for tax purposes.

159
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,120
What's life
without the ability
to make stupid choices?

160
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,640
She needs her free will.

161
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,680
Find out why her brain froze
before she can't decide
to take her next breath.

162
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,560
You find the toxins.
You run your bubble study.

163
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,960
You won't find anything but
I'll get the office to myself.

164
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,640
There's a lot of porn
piling up on the Internet.

165
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
Doesn't download itself.

166
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,880
Eric? Eric!

167
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,600
Hello, Mr. Foreman.

168
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
Dr. Chase. How are you?
Good.

169
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,320
You're lucky
you caught us, actually...

170
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,400
I'll meet you outside.

171
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,680
Hey, Dad. I've got to go.
Why are you here?

172
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,600
Everything okay?

173
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,560
Good as ever.

174
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,040
We're staying at a hotel
down the street.

175
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,920
You didn't bring Mom with you?

176
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,320
It's gonna be her
60th birthday in a few days.

177
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,360
I know. We talked
about it on the phone.

178
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,080
You said you couldn't
come home.

179
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
You didn't have to come.

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,240
You haven't been home
in eight years.

181
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,480
She should see you,

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,960
while she still
knows who you are.

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Dad. I've talked to her
on the phone.

184
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,760
She only knows
who I am sometimes.

185
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,880
Sometimes

186
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,800
is important.

187
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,960
So what's up with your dad?
Didn't know he was
gonna be in town?

188
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,000
No.

189
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Building this old, could be
toxic exposure anywhere.

190
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,320
Asbestos, mold,
the coloring agents
in the old wallpaper.

191
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,720
Or it could be drugs.

192
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,240
I thought we ruled out...

193
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,320
Clean tox screen means
drugs didn't cause the TIA.

194
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,200
Drugs can be laced
with toxic substances.

195
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,760
Arsenic, rat poison.

196
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,160
The drugs wash out
of her system,

197
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
the toxins stick around.

198
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,240
Exposure could come about
any number of ways.

199
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,400
There's no reason to assume
it was through drug use.

200
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,600
Absolutely.
Except for the crack pipe.

201
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
I'll test her blood
for arsenic and rat poison.

202
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,520
Yeah. Yeah.
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

203
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,480
And your dad asked you out
for dinner?

204
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll do the tests.
You're stuck with your family.

205
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
You like Hockney?

206
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,640
You heard about that.

207
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,920
The pop stuff or
the Venezuelan pictures?

208
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,440
That's a trick question.

209
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Yes. But you have no idea
how it's a trick.

210
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,400
I like art.
I'm open to new things.
What's the problem?

211
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,600
You're going to a gallery
to see Venezuelan pictures
that don't exist.

212
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,400
But you won't go
to a play with me. Why?

213
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,520
House, why is my social life
suddenly red hot?

214
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,120
One minute I'm mushing along
with the huskies as usual

215
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,240
and suddenly
it's global warming.

216
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,560
You think you saw
somebody else pick up
a toy from the sandbox

217
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,440
and suddenly you want it.

218
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,240
Is that why you said no?

219
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,040
Maybe I just want a friend
and I thought Wilson
was a safe choice.

220
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm not safe? Cool.

221
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,840
James Wilson is never
the safe choice.

222
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,280
We're going to a gallery.
We're not getting married.

223
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,960
Sure, you say that now.

224
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,560
He always marries them
in the end.

225
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Is that Eric? Eric!

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,440
Oh!

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,120
Oh, baby. Baby!

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,320
I wanted to find that
picture I took at your
high school graduation.

229
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,560
I had it reframed.

230
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,240
It's in one of these
suitcases, but I don't know...

231
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,720
You can show it to me later.

232
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,560
Your father wants to know
if you've been praying.

233
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,440
You don't have to just
come out with it like that.

234
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,760
But I only want to know
if you're happy.

235
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
Sure. I'm okay.

236
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,640
You like it here?
You have friends?

237
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,800
Yeah.
Everything is great, Mom.

238
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,760
That's why I brought
the picture for you.

239
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,320
I remember
when you were little

240
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,360
you liked to look in
the back of the math book
because you knew

241
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
even though it made
no sense then,

242
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,160
by the end of the year
you'd understand it all.

243
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,800
That's why
you brought the picture?

244
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,480
You wanted to look ahead,
to see how far you'd go.

245
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,760
Now you're a grown man,
I thought you might
like to look back

246
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,760
to see how far you've come.

247
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,720
It all makes sense now.
Doesn't it?

248
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,720
(CHUCKLES)

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,080
That isn't mine.

250
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,640
(COUGHING)
It was in your closet.

251
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,560
It belongs to this guy
who used to live with me.

252
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,920
You might want to let him know
he's got arsenic poisoning.

253
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
We should get
a sample of his hair

254
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,520
so we can see
the extent of it.

255
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,200
But I don't do...
I don't do drugs.

256
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,640
(COUGHING)

257
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,840
Get a crash cart in here!
Respiratory arrest!

258
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,720
Are you sure
it isn't from the arsenic?

259
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,080
Dr. Foreman said
I was poisoned.

260
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,080
<i>Your hair showed
only a trace amount.</i>

261
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,680
<i>Not enough to damage
your lungs like this.</i>

262
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,280
<i>We need you
to stay still now.</i>

263
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,600
Six-millimeter cuts
starting at the apices.

264
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,760
Also, I just wanted
to let you know

265
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,160
should you change your mind,
I'll be available.

266
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,200
Aren't you getting tired
of hearing me say it?

267
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,120
I have no intention
of going out with you,

268
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
of having sex with you,
of doing anything with you.

269
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,600
Except work.

270
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
We don't have to make
a big deal about it.

271
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,840
I just thought
I'd let you know.

272
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,960
I decided Tuesdays would be
a good day to do that.

273
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
You did not suddenly
fall in love with me.

274
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,560
You were looking for something
and I happened to be
standing...

275
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,240
Cameron, it's fine.

276
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,240
No need to go on about it.

277
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,680
Advancing through
the lung bases.

278
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
We need to put this
behind us.

279
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Understood.

280
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,840
But you keep bringing it up.

281
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,440
You're the one
who's still talking.

282
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,280
Look, I'm not demanding
anything from you.

283
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm not following you home.
I've got no expectations.

284
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,880
A gentle, polite reminder
once a week
is hardly stalking.

285
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,840
There's a mass.
Just outside the lingula.

286
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,880
Biopsy shows
there are white blood cells

287
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,280
in the walls
of the blood vessels.

288
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,560
They're not supposed
to get past the bouncers.

289
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,400
Got to be autoimmune,
something lymphocytic.

290
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,240
White blood cells
are attacking her own body.

291
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,200
Only question is,
what kind of autoimmune?

292
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,280
Doesn't matter what kind.

293
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,000
It always matters what kind.

294
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,160
Treatment's always steroids.

295
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,640
Treatment is always boring.

296
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,840
Diagnosis...
Okay.

297
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
It's affecting
the larger blood vessels.

298
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,160
Gotta be giant cell arteritis.
I'll start her on steroids.

299
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,880
It's affecting
the smaller blood vessels.

300
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,080
Gotta be lupus vasculitis.

301
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,640
I'll start her on steroids.

302
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,800
It's affecting...
Yeah. Got it.

303
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
Start her on steroids.

304
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,360
Good idea.

305
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,080
Told you. That was boring.

306
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,400
I gotta go out.
Why?

307
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,200
Wilson's got a date.

308
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,200
<i>BONNIE.: It's got
15-foot ceilings.</i>

309
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
It's got an open floor plan.

310
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,040
(CHUCKLES)

311
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,040
You know, I can't believe
you called me.

312
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,960
Hey. I need a condo.

313
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,080
Didn't you and Wilson have
your first date around here?

314
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Wow! You remember
where our first date was?

315
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,800
I didn't think
you were paying attention.

316
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,080
Really? He's my best friend.

317
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,320
Our first date was in Boston.

318
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,440
Oh.

319
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
Not quite as close
to here as I remember.

320
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,400
But we're not here
to talk about him.

321
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,760
Absolutely not.

322
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,120
Wait till you see the kitchen.

323
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,160
All-granite countertops.

324
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,120
Since I wasn't paying
attention back then,

325
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,240
what was it like dating him?

326
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,280
So this is Hockney?
No.

327
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,400
I don't know what happened.

328
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
I'm sure you don't.

329
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,360
I never knew your tastes
were so eclectic.

330
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,320
Oh, the Hockney exhibit
finished on April 20th.

331
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,800
I thought it was May 20th.

332
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,680
Okay. My bad.

333
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,160
This is not somewhere
I'd bring someone on a date.

334
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,080
Not that this is a date.
Obviously.

335
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,600
I was just thinking...

336
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,080
He's doing landscapes
on multiple canvases now.

337
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,800
And they're kind of peaceful
and you're always so busy...

338
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,080
Wow.

339
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,320
(CHUCKLES)

340
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,920
I don't think I've ever
seen you embarrassed before.

341
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,240
Oh, it was never a date.

342
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,400
I was coming off
a bad relationship

343
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
and he said we could
go out as friends.

344
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,480
You know, just go see plays,
go to a museum.

345
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,520
I didn't think
you liked Trenton.

346
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Love it.

347
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,080
So he'd say it's not a date
but then he'd jump you.

348
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,560
Oh, no. He meant it.

349
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,960
James Wilson,
carefully calibrating

350
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,440
his level of protectiveness
for your individual needs.

351
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,360
Did you just compare
Wilson to a tampon?

352
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,520
(CHUCKLES) No.

353
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,560
It was very endearing.
He really just wanted
to be a friend.

354
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,480
So I jumped him.

355
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,760
The bedroom's through here.

356
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,120
CUDDY: That's such a bad idea.

357
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,120
There's no way that
won't cause damage
to the large intestine.

358
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Are you keeping us here
to torture me?

359
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,960
Is that a bicycle pump?

360
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
That's what I'm saying.

361
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,360
It's like walking
into a sticky trap.

362
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,840
And once you're the focus
of all that attention,
it's addictive.

363
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,600
This unit's kitchen's
got a chef's oven.

364
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,200
I cook a lot. Go on.

365
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,320
But it's the emotional stuff
that really sucks you in.

366
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,240
He's just so
knight-in-shining-armor,
you know?

367
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,080
Always there to support you,
until one day he's not.

368
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,800
But by then you're hooked.

369
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,080
Hey, do you think that
you could talk to him
about taking the dog?

370
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,320
He's the only one
that Hector really
gets along with.

371
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,320
Hey, we're here to talk
real estate, not Wilson.

372
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
So you're saying
if you'd actually had sex

373
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,080
before you connected
emotionally, you'd have
gotten over him.

374
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,680
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah.
Seems weird, right?

375
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,920
'Cause sex with James
is fantastic.

376
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,680
Nobody works harder
to give a woman
what she wants.

377
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,440
It's got six burners.

378
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,160
The chef's oven.

379
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,200
Right.

380
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,560
(LUPE COUGHING)

381
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,800
How you feeling?

382
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,400
That wasn't my crack pipe.

383
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,040
You told me. Are you tired?

384
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,680
I just took a hit off it
a couple of times.

385
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,600
What's wrong with
having a little fun?

386
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,560
Your personal life
is none of my business.

387
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,720
You don't like me though,
do you?

388
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,320
That's your imagination.

389
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,880
I've seen every kind
of drug abuse.

390
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,400
No offense,
but you don't even
stand out of the pack.

391
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,920
I'm betting you got money
in the same place
you got attitude.

392
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,480
You know,
people who quit drinking
and people who lose weight.

393
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,160
They think they're better
than the people that couldn't

394
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,120
and because you got
out of the projects,

395
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,720
you think that
anybody who didn't

396
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,400
is weak and stupid.

397
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,040
I'm not judging you.
Now take a breath.

398
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,960
The only difference
between me and you

399
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,000
is that I made
some bad decisions

400
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,240
and you made some good ones.

401
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,240
You make bad decisions
every day of your life.

402
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,040
Stop doing drugs.
Stop having fun.

403
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,640
Go back to school
and get your GED.

404
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,520
Yeah, where's the money
coming from?

405
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,960
The system's not set up
for people like me.

406
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,920
What are you staring at?

407
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,960
Your eyes.

408
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,240
There's yellow in the sclera.

409
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,720
Her liver's failing.

410
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,440
Without a transplant,
she'll be dead
in the next 48 hours.

411
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,200
We should increase
her immunosuppressants
and target more specifically.

412
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Add methotrexate.

413
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,760
Yeah, let's do more
of what's not working.

414
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,520
This isn't an
autoimmune disease.

415
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,360
Her white blood cells
are attacking her body.

416
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,400
That's autoimmune.

417
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,240
FOREMAN: First brain,
then lungs, now liver.

418
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,200
All getting worse
and all in two days.

419
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,640
It's moving too fast.

420
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
It's gotta be cancer.
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

421
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,360
It's rare even
by our standards
but it fits her symptoms.

422
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,920
Explains why the steroids
aren't working,
poor fingernail growth.

423
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,400
A lot of people
have bad fingernails.

424
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,760
A lot of people don't have
three organ systems
shutting down.

425
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,960
Her blood vessels are
taking this thing everywhere.

426
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,240
She needs total
body radiation.

427
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
We can't do anything
until we can confirm...

428
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,960
Running those
immunochemistries
could take a week.

429
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,960
She'll be dead by the time...

430
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,760
That doesn't make
radiation any safer.

431
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Okay.

432
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Suppose Chase
and Cameron are right.

433
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
Suppose it's an
autoimmune disease.

434
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,680
What's the biggest danger
of total body radiation?

435
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,200
It suppresses
the immune system,

436
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,080
which is what
we're trying to do
with the steroids anyway.

437
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,640
I don't usually
put out on my first date

438
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,120
but I gotta say
that is a rad move.

439
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,000
Get her consent.
Start the radiation.

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,360
The patient's
not too thrilled with me.

441
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,880
I'll get her consent.

442
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,560

personality issues,

443
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,520
so you're gonna step in?

444
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,280
Patient doesn't like Foreman.
I'm interested.

445
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,920
Fatigue, hair loss,
possibility of damage
to the lungs, infertility.

446
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,640
All possible side effects
of radiation.

447
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,960
Why don't you like
Dr. Foreman?

than he is.

How good is he?

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
I don't know.

452
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,480
Can we get back
to what's wrong with me?

453
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,840
There's a small
possibility of leukemia
at some time in the future.

454
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,880
Hardly worth mentioning.

455
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,960
You can't say he thinks
he's better than he is

456
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,920
if you don't know
how good he is.

457
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,880
No one's as good
as he thinks he is.

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
I am.

where you keep going wrong,

Yes. I was worried there was

Huh?

496
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,880
Yeah. She also said

497
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,120
that if she'd slept with you
before she liked you

498
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,320

easier to handle

(SHUSHING)

514
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,360
I'm getting a murmur.

515
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,600
Oh, my arm! It's hurting me!

516
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
Take it off! Take it off!

517
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,640
(SCREAMING)

518
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,960
Oh, my God!

519
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,760
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

520
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,120
CAMERON: Pain is the issue.

521
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,320
Just the pressure
of the BP cuff

522
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,960
was enough
to start her screaming.

523
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,280
That's not cancer.

524
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,120
It sounds like...

525
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,120
Sounds like she's septic.

526
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,120
A lot of things
can cause pain.

527
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,000
How much pain?

528
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,800
Too much.

529
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,160
It's not cancer.
It's not autoimmune.

530
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,720
It's an infection and
we fried her immune system.

531
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,120
CHASE: But she had no fever.
Her LP was clear.

532
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,920
Do an echo.
Confirm it's in the heart.

533
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,280
And then I'll tell our patient
that we just killed her.

534
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,360
I'll tell her.

535
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,800
(DOOR OPENS)

536
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,280
Hi. You haven't been
returning my phone calls.

537
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,600
I'm busy.

538
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,960
Well, but if you
have half an hour

539
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,200
a little later this afternoon,

540
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,880
I just found this unit
ten minutes from here.

541
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,360
It hasn't been
on the market yet.

542
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm off the market for condos.

543
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,880
James was right?

544
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,360
I never had
the teeniest chance
of selling you anything?

545
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,720
Of course he was right.

546
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,240
Wilson doesn't stop
giving good advice
just 'cause you're divorced.

547
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,360
He's compulsive about
remaining on good terms
with his exes.

548
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,360
Do you wanna know why
I named that dog Hector?

549
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,560
No. Let's keep it a mystery.

550
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,640
Because even when
he was a puppy,

551
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,000
he was the worst-tempered dog
we'd ever seen.

552
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,640
He was supposed
to be house-trained.

553
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,000
He'd pee on the carpet
every morning.

554
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,960
When we had people over,
he had to nip at their ankles.

555
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,080
"Hector does go rug"
is an anagram
for "Doctor Greg House".

556
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,200
That's how early
in the marriage
I resented you.

557
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,880
Wow. Did I ever waste money
on that place setting.

558
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,520
James at least
had the decency

559
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,920
to feel guilty
when he hurt me.

560
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,560
Whereas I didn't hurt you.

561
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,680
I didn't even marry you,
cleverly hoping to avoid
moments like this one.

562
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,760
You always needed him and
he was always there for you.

563
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,480
If you keep yelling,
I'll think you'll owe me sex.

564
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,080
You knew he had a wife
waiting at home.
You didn't care.

565
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,480
Now, I'm not saying
you broke up the marriage,
but you didn't help.

566
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,480
First, "Hector does go rug"
is a lame anagram.

567
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,920
You want a better one
for Gregory House?
"Huge ego. Sorry."

568
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,520
Second, find a new career.

569
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
You're never gonna
sell anybody

570
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,280
if you let them
control the agenda.

571
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,760
And third,
I don't owe you anything.

572
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,120
I'm not Wilson.
I'm not gonna buy a condo
just to make you feel better.

573
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,120
WILSON: You okay?

574
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,160
Yeah.

575
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
Tell me how to do this.

576
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,640
House says
people thank you after.

577
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,800
It's not typical.

578
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,920
I already killed this woman.

579
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,360
All I can do now
is not make
any more mistakes.

580
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,240
First of all, stop thinking
you can minimize the hurt.

581
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,800
A lot of people are afraid
of the word "dying."

582
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,400
If you pussyfoot around it,
she's not going to
read your mind.

583
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,440
Okay.
No, it's not.

584
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
When you look in her face,

585
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
you're gonna feel
the instinct to temporize.

586
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,840
Crush it.

587
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah.

588
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,640
Then wait.

589
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,880
Give her time
to process the news.

590
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,200
Let her know
you'll be with her
through all of it.

591
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,440
Wait till she's
done thinking,

592
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,920
till she meets
your eyes again.

593
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,080
Then if you feel
it's appropriate,
you can touch her.

594
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,680
Maybe put your hand
on her arm like this.

595
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,240
Let her know
she's still connected
to another human being.

596
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,760
You've got this down
to a science.

597
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,600
You're freaking out.

598
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,400
I told you...
Give her what she needs.

599
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,240
What she doesn't need
is a doctor who's
not there with her

600
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,400
because he made
the wrong call.

601
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,520
You are freaking out.
You should be freaking out.

602
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,680
I won't let her see it.

603
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,960
Let her see it.

604
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,920
Hey.

605
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,760
How come no mask?

606
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,960
We think...

607
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,960
You have an infection.

608
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,280
Didn't the radiation work?

609
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,680
It did what it was
supposed to do.

610
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,680
You're dying.

611
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,200
What do you mean?
Like things are bad and
that someday I'm gonna...

612
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
How much time?

613
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,800
How much time?

614
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,000
We can't know exactly.

615
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,240
A year?

616
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,560
Less than a year?

617
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,200
Less than 24 hours.

618
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
I don't understand.

619
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,400
Why are you saying this to me?
You're trying to scare me?

620
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
Why would you do that?

621
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,880
I'm sorry.

622
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,040
It's true.

623
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,720
How bad is this cancer?
Yesterday you thought
I had a chance.

624
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,000
You don't have cancer.

625
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,600
You came in with an infection.

626
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
We didn't catch it.

627
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,280
What kind of infection?

628
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,680
Doesn't matter.

(SIGHS)

630
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,280
Radiation was the worst thing
we could have done.

631
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,280
We destroyed
the part of your body
that was fighting it off.

632
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,240
It's spread to your heart.

633
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,960
Then give me drugs.

634
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,400
They have drugs
for infections.

635
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,920
Antibiotics work
with the immune system,

636
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,880
but your immune system
is nonexistent
because of the radiation.

637
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,200
If it's my heart,
you can get me a new heart.

638
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,560
People have heart transplants
all the time!

639
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,760
It wouldn't help.

640
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,040
The infection's everywhere.

641
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,760
There's nothing
anybody can do.

We'll call your grandparents.

645
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,120
Get the hell away from me!
Get out!

646
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,240
Get out!

648
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,720
CAMERON: I think it's broken.

649
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Nothing like a melodramatic
gesture to solve everything.

650
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,040
We were wrong, too.
Steroids wouldn't
have helped her.

651
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,080
I didn't not help her.
I actually pulled the trigger.

652
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,280
There's nothing left
for you to do.

653

One of us could
go home with...

654
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,000
You're trying to
make me feel better?

655
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,960
Yeah.
I killed a woman.

656
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,080
Don't you think
it's appropriate

657
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,800
I feel like crap
for at least a little while?

658
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,800
It won't help her.

659
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,040
Where is he?

660
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,480
He went to the ICU.

We still don't know
what infection...

664
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,760
It's not gonna help her.

665
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,000
It's not gonna hurt her.

666
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,360
Well, it is gonna hurt her
but it's not gonna...

667
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,600
No.

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,080
This'll just take
a few minutes.

669

I'll grab a piece
of an abscess,

00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,760
some pus...
You really don't care.

671
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,640
You really don't care
why she's gonna be dead.

672

have to stay in ICU.

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,760
Want to see
if I'm dying on schedule?

683

Or do you want me
to tell you it's all right,

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,880
'Cause this isn't like you
ran your cart into mine
at the supermarket.

688
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,680
No.

689
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,440
Your grandparents
haven't arrived yet.

690
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,400
If they don't make it on time,

691
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,080
is there anything
you'd like me to tell them?

692
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
I never really knew them.

693
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,960
You got any friends
you want me to call?

694
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,800
It's the middle of the night.

695
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,960
They're not the kind
of friends you ask
to help you move,

696
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,320
never mind watch you die.

697
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,800
I never did much.

698
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
No kid to leave behind.

699
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,480
When I go, the world's
not gonna be any different.

700
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,480
Kind of a relief for you, huh?

701
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,160
You were right about me.

702
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,040
Yeah? Which time?

703
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,240
I had a problem with you.

704
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,040
But you were wrong, too.

705
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,560
I've made some bad decisions.

706
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,440
Stole cars. Robbed houses.

707
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,640
Killed a woman.

708
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,680
(CLEARS THROAT)

709
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,840
But then I got another chance.

710
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,920
Left home, went to college,
entered a whole other world.

711
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,480
And there's some part of me
I can't get rid of,
always thinks,

712
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,560
if I'm not the smartest,
if I'm not the first,
everywhere I go

713
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,280
they'll figure out
I'm not supposed to be here.

714
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,600
They'll send me back.

715
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,200
You know that's
not gonna happen.

716
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,800
You're out.

717
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,240
I'll never be out of there.

718
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,960
When I came home
that last Christmas
I was in college,

719
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,640
it was like the rooms

720
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,000
felt so small.

721
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,360
It was suffocating.

722
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,360
But when I was standing
on the stoop saying goodbye,

723
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,680
my mom put her arms around me.

724
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,880
That was...

725
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,880
That was the last time
I ever felt at home.

726
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,720
I only put distance

727
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,240
between you and me
because I know
there isn't any.

728
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,400
You were right about me, too.

729
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,360
That stuff about
the system being
against people like me...

730
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,680
I know it's crap.

731
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,240
I mean, it's true
but it's also crap.

732
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,280
I just wasn't ready
to try again.

733
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,520
But I always thought
I was young.

734
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,280
I had time.

735
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,240
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

736
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,360
Aren't you ever gonna leave?

737
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,240
No.

738
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,640
(RINGING)

739
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,640
Yeah?

740
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,280
Time of death, 3:35.

741
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,240
Do whatever you want.

742
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,920
<i>(FOLLOW THE LEADER PLAYING)</i>

743
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,000
You wanna go and get drunk?

744
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,120
No, thanks.

745
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,120
I've got paperwork.

746
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,040
Listen, I don't...

747
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,960
I don't know what I believe
but sometimes I need to think

748
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,120
there's something out there
paying attention.

749
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,600
So when I can't
talk to anybody,

750
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,480
I talk to God and pretend
somebody's listening.

751
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,560
We were all wrong. You know?

752
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,840
Even House was wrong.

753
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,320
I know.

754
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,480
<i>(FOLLOW THE LEADER

755
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,600
(INAUDIBLE)

756
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,680
I got your consent.

757
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,680
Her bra hook.

758
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,800
What?

759
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,200
She scratched herself
with her bra hook.

760
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
That's how
the infection got in.

761
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,520
Staph aureus.

762
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,760
She died from a simple
staph infection?

763
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,400
That and some bad decisions.

764
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,520
I'll be outside.

765
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,840
Go home.
Have a few drinks.
Go to sleep.

766
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,200
Get up tomorrow.
And do it all over.

767
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,240
Only better.

768
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,200
If you need absolution,
go to a priest

769
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,240
or give alms to the poor.

770
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Whatever ritual comforts you.

771
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,960
I killed her.

772
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,520
Yeah. Me, too.

773
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,680
This wasn't,
"Oh, I should've thought
of that idea sooner."

774
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,680
This wasn't messing up
a dosage!

775
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,440
We see a disease rushing down
on someone like a train,

776
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,560
we can't always get them
out of the way!

777
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,240
But this wasn't that.

778
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,520
No.

779
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,160
And you'll do it again.

780
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,280
For a lot of doctors,

781
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,120
this would be
a once-in-a-lifetime mistake.

782
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,000
But we're not
a lot of doctors.

783
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,760
And we'll save more patients
than the guy down the street

784
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,560
but a few of the ones
that he'd save

785
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,080
by doing what
everyone else does,
we will lose.

786
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,360
So you're giving me numbers.

787
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,400
Because they don't lie.

788
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,240
I can't forgive you, Foreman.

789
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,480
Because there's
nothing to forgive.

What did you tell him?

792
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,560
That guilt is irrelevant.

You wanna get
something to eat?

794
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,320
Can't.

I did something bad, Mom.

799
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,680
I hurt somebody.

800
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,280
It wasn't your fault.

801
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,160
It was.

802
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,680
Then I forgive you.

803
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,320
I forgive you.

804
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,480
I can see from your face

805
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,880
you'd never hurt anybody
on purpose.

806
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,200
Do you know who I am, Mom?

807
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,520
It's Eric.

808
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,360
Of course.

809
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,880
My little boy's name is Eric.
