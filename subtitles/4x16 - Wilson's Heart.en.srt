1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,094
<i>Previously on House.</i>

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,260
<i>I don't know how I got here.</i>

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,429
<i>I saw a symptom before the crash.</i>

4
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:06,732
Why was I taking a bus?

5
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:10,239
<i>Medical hypnosis can bring the
brain to a Class 2 Theta state.</i>

6
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,208
You're taxing an already injured brain.

7
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,610
Someone's dying because
I can't remember...

8
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,742
It was Amber.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,112
She was on the bus with me.

10
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,446
She's the one who's dying.

11
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,716
Her heart won't stop racing.
No idea what's causing it.

12
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,782
Sure it wasn't the
bus that landed on her?

13
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:27,824
It's not trauma.

14
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,328
She was stable post-op. This
didn't start until an hour ago.

15
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,865
My God. Delayed reaction to the trauma.

16
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,695
She lost both kidneys in the bus crash,

17
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,167
ripped up her femoral artery.

18
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,467
We fixed the artery, got her
on dialysis for the kidneys.

19
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,870
Whatever's doing this to her
heart, it isn't from the crash.

20
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,135
Check her potassium? Of course.

21
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,369
Why didn't you call me?

22
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,674
She's been under the
whole time. She had no ID.

23
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,373
Pushed adenosine? And verapamil.

24
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,938
And floated a Swan an hour ago.

25
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,415
Coronary angiography?

26
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,951
Three critical patients ahead of her.

27
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,419
We'll have her in within the hour.

28
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,082
We're fifteen minutes away from
Princeton-Plainsboro by ambulance.

29
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,251
You want to move her?
Her heart rate is 130.

30
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,317
She's hemodynamically
stable. We're moving her.

31
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,795
You're not her doctor, you
can't make that decision.

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,794
Her husband can.

33
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,062
Right?

34
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,267
Move her.

35
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,567
If the trauma didn't damage her heart...

36
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,942
Why was she on the bus?

37
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,139
I don't know.

38
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,578
If she had any underlying condition,

39
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,116
the accident could have exacerbated it.

40
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,276
Why were you with her?

41
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,375
I don't know.

42
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,353
I'm not hiding anything,
I just don't remember.

43
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,013
What else could damage her heart?

44
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,448
Wilson. Don't get lost.

45
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,017
I'm barely coherent. I
need your help right now.

46
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,625
V
- fib.

47
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,795
Charging.

48
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,030
Okay. Okay.

49
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,501
Clear! Wait. Wait! Wait!

50
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,131
Protective hypothermia.

51
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,267
You want to freeze her?
Her heart's not beating.

52
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,676
Her heart's already damaged.

53
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,077
You restart it, it'll keep racing,

54
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,116
shoot off free radicals
and kill her brain.

55
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,778
We ice her down, put her on
bypass until you've diagnosed her.

56
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,153
This is not a solution. All
you're doing is pressing pause.

57
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,659
It gives you more time
to find the diagnosis.

58
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,194
House. This is Amber.

59
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,393
Please.

60
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,569
Cold saline solution.

61
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,540
Core temperature down to 90.

62
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,876
Bypass circulating.

63
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,817
She's stable.

64
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,191
Why are we doing this?

65
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,389
Bought us time to think.

66
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,873
The trauma must have stimulated
a pre-existing heart condition.

67
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,705
Auto-immune, congenital anomaly,

68
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,711
blood-clotting disorder,
lead poisoning...

69
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,803
Could be anything.

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,575
Great. Let's explore that.

71
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,013
Quick, get her on panacea.

72
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,746
We can narrow it down by
looking for arterial blockages.

73
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,514
How? On an echo?

74
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,112
Can't see wall motion
when there's no motion.

75
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,589
EKG? Nope, heart's in the off position.

76
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,523
Thallium uptake scan?
Useless on a cold heart.

77
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,562
Yeah, we get it. Her
heart's not beating.

78
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,892
It's gonna make it harder to diagnose.

79
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,432
On the other hand, she's not gonna
die while you're whining about it.

80
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,522
What else?

81
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,569
There is another way to narrow it down.

82
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,606
If you really did see a symptom
in Amber before the crash,

83
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,573
physostigmine helped
your memory last time.

84
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,578
Why not cyanide? He's a
mess, he needs to sleep.

85
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,847
I had a heart attack this morning.

86
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,541
I can't do any more drugs till lunch.

87
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,380
Get her an angiogram. It could
show damage even in a stopped heart.

88
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,942
Rest of you, search her apartment.

89
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,921
Toxins, heavy metals, drugs...

90
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,321
Anything that might make her heart race.

91
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,908
I need to know if there's
anything medically relevant

92
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,845
that you couldn't share publicly.

93
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,616
Is this a Philanderers
Anonymous intervention?

94
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,278
You were obviously drinking last night.

95
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,288
Maybe you took Amber to a bar?

96
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,449
I left here on my motorcycle. Alone.

97
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,085
You ended up drunk on a bus. Together.

98
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,961
Maybe you met Amber in the bar?

99
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,860
I was not having an affair with her.

100
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,263
You can't really say that
if you don't remember.

101
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,325
I lost four hours, not four months.

102
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,495
Maybe it was the first time.

103
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:43,335
If you drank together, any
chance you did any drugs?

104
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,948
I'll run a tox screen.

105
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,523
You coming?

106
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,801
Correspondence. Letters to patients.

107
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,896
She could have caught
something from one of them.

108
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,998
Copy it to a thumb drive.
Let's get out of here.

109
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,101
Travel. Do you know if she's
been out of the country recently?

110
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,306
It's just video clips. Maybe
she narrates where they are.

111
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,082
<i>And action!</i>

112
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,343
Looks like she didn't travel very far.

113
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,485
<i>You look beautiful. You look nervous.</i>

114
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,854
<i>I've never done this before.</i>

115
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,359
<i>I have. Trust me. You'll love it.</i>

116
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,393
Hey. Not even close to relevant.

117
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,241
As long as we don't know what's wrong,

118
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,675
we don't know what's relevant.

119
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,714
Yeah, maybe they're having
sex on a pile of asbestos.

120
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,113
Go watch it.

121
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,172
If we were in a stranger's house,

122
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,377
you'd be watching the video.

123
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,943
You altered your behavior
because you're friends with her.

124
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:03,814
Are you okay?

125
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,790
We shouldn't be treating her at all.

126
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,420
I'm gonna search her bathroom.

127
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,615
Are you okay?

128
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,157
Can't really say "yes" when
it's a hallucination asking.

129
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,421
Don't worry, you're just dreaming.

130
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,459
What symptom did I see in you?

131
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,131
A myoclonic jerk. Boring.

132
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,736
An incredibly rare
neurological symptom is boring?

133
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,774
Am I in someone else's subconscious?

134
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,073
What did we do last night?

135
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,285
Was I meeting you for a drink?

136
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,690
Is that all it was?

137
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,030
A man thinks a woman is beautiful,

138
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,166
admires her intelligence,

139
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,832
admires the way she has
to get whatever she wants.

140
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,935
The things he likes about himself.

141
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:39,182
And maybe she always had
a little thing for him.

142
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,820
His mind, his blue eyes.

143
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,358
But someone gets between them.

144
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,493
So they decide to meet one night

145
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,692
at an out-of-the-way
little bar...

146
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,401
Does that sound familiar?

147
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,073
Do I feel familiar?

148
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,247
What do you feel?

149
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,745
Electricity.

150
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,289
Electricity.

151
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,124
I know I saw the symptom.

152
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,358
I know the memory is locked in my
brain, now I know how to get it.

153
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,793
No.

154
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,696
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

155
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,363
You need to rest.

156
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,432
I have yet to hear about any
study linking electricity and rest.

157
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,238
Deep brain stimulation.

158
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,279
It's been proven.

159
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,507
Electrical impulses applied
directly to the hypothalamus

160
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,708
can evoke detailed memories.

161
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,909
My mistake.

162
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,951
Drilling a hole

163
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,454
and shooting lightning bolts into an
already cracked skull is very restful.

164
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,954
It's not fatal at all.

165
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,081
She's right. You need to sleep.

166
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,724
Brain activity spiked.

167
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,425
Amber?

168
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,956
Amber? It's me.

169
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,033
Random spikes are common.

170
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,262
Shut up.

171
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,073
It's gonna be okay.

172
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,674
I'm here with you.

173
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,913
The team has found something.

174
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,343
Can you ask her if we can be excused?

175
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,515
What?

176
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,087
The coronary angio was negative.

177
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,631
So was the tox screen.

178
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,960
That's what you found? Negative tests?

179
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,367
I could have told you
she doesn't do drugs.

180
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,633
I found these in her apartment. Sorry.

181
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,939
Prescription diet pills,
SSRIs, amphetamines.

182
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,879
Diet pills cause structural
damage to the mitral valve,

183
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,505
could explain the tachycardia.

184
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,983
She'd have to be an addict to take enough
for her to damage her heart. I'd know.

185
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,351
Did you know she was
hiding them in her vitamins?

186
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,686
We have to warm her back up, get her
heart beating so we can do a CT to confirm.

187
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,383
No. We've been over this.

188
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,188
Starting her heart
could cause brain damage,

189
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,662
could burn out the heart muscle.

190
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,695
Test her heart without starting it.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,628
Crack her chest open. Reach a
finger inside the pulmonary vein,

192
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,330
run it across the valve.

193
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,236
That's the safer course?

194
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,466
It is if we're wrong.

195
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,634
When did we start assuming we're wrong?

196
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,740
If this were any other patient...

197
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,077
If the valve is calcified,
that's our answer,

198
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,843
that's our cure. Go.

199
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,550
Thirteen.

200
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,956
Who found the diet pills?

201
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,222
Kutner.

202
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,198
You didn't even go in
the bathroom, did you?

203
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,130
You're suddenly mute
in the differentials.

204
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,099
A blow-up doll would be more useful.

205
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,297
And yes, that's the first time

206
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,307
I've ever implied something
negative about a blow-up doll.

207
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,736
It's Amber. I don't...

208
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,902
Normally, I'd be fascinated.

209
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,478
Today, don't care.

210
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,140
Get over whatever it is and do your job.

211
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,493
Wait. Look at her eye.

212
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,723
She's jaundiced.

213
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,995
Her liver's not working.

214
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,094
Diet pills don't kill the liver.

215
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,029
Put her back in ICU.

216
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,109
Liver failure means whatever
this thing is, it's spreading.

217
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,579
Despite the fact that she's frozen.

218
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,616
Hepatic and heart failure could
mean anti-trypsinase deficiency.

219
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,549
We can stick a needle in her liver.

220
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,917
We see fibrosis, she's right.

221
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,455
Does Amber drink sherry?

222
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,382
Nocardia fits just as well,

223
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,051
but there's no way we can tell,

224
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,720
since we can't take her temperature.

225
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,822
I had a dream she was
pouring me a glass.

226
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,095
And since I'm a scotch,
beer, gin and rum man...

227
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,400
If we warm her back up, we should be
able to tell if she's got an infection.

228
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,939
Yes, we can get a diagnosis

229
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,942
by letting the disease run
rampant until it kills her.

230
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,410
If it's spreading, we need
to slow this even more.

231
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,572
We've got to cool her down further.

232
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,978
I know you love her and you're
scared she's going to die.

233
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,081
But just making her colder
and colder isn't a cure.

234
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,685
It's not dealing with the reality.

235
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,457
Sherry means something.

236
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,227
Amber doesn't even drink sherry.

237
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,268
House, can we get back to...

238
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,168
If she did drink sherry, it would
mean nothing, but since she doesn't,

239
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,763
my subconscious is obviously
trying to make some other point.

240
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,772
There's a Sharrie's Bar on
Third, right off the bus route.

241
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,444
Wilson's right. We
need to make her colder.

242
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,919
Putting more ice on her is
just delaying the diagnosis.

243
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,289
Not on, in. Fill her lungs with slurry.

244
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,452
Where are you going?

245
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,155
Taking Wilson out for a drink.

246
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,634
Is this the place?

247
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,697
Maybe.

248
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:09,710
Hey. I assume you are here for these.

249
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,952
Did you see me here with
a tall, blonde woman?

250
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,787
Yeah, I think she joined you
after scotch number seven.

251
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,186
Did she seem sick?

252
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,659
She sneezed.

253
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,493
I gave her a napkin.

254
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,053
Did you see the color of the sputum?

255
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,860
I assume sputum means snot.

256
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,191
Look, I see lots of
drunk chicks in here.

257
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,965
I didn't have time to stop and analyze
the color of your girlfriend's boogers.

258
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,904
She's not my girlfriend, genius.

259
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,442
She was hot, you seemed into her

260
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,068
and she bought you drinks.

261
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,010
Last night, she was your girlfriend.

262
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,752
Blood in her sputum. It could
mean parasites. Any recent travel?

263
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,757
You seemed into her?

264
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,089
If he had a brain, he
wouldn't be tending bar.

265
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,960
Sneezing's a new symptom.

266
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,521
Let's assume the runny
nose means an infection.

267
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,327
What did House have to say?

268
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,428
He told me I was raised by wolves,

269
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,200
and that's why I use the same
hand for my fork and knife.

270
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,799
Whoa.

271
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,037
Not that one. The slurry tube.

272
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,276
I know this is different. But it's not.

273
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,246
Everyone dies.

274
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,214
She's not dead.

275
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,354
You're reacting this way
because she might be soon.

276
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,553
Yeah. I am. Why aren't you?

277
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,264
I'm an Indian guy named Kutner.

278
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,090
Ever wonder what happened to my parents?

279
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,430
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I was six years old.

280
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,232
I used to like helping out in
my parent's store after school.

281
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,039
A guy walks in to rob the place,

282
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,574
ends up shooting them both.

283
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,802
Wasn't fair.

284
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:49,247
Took years, but I had to accept
that's just the way it was.

285
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,607
So, you gonna help me
fill her lungs up, or not?

286
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:09,590
Tell me the liver biopsy showed
infiltrates, minor inflammation.

287
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,169
Yeah. How...

288
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,397
Snot on a napkin.

289
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,406
Add the heart, the infiltrates...

290
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,634
Hep B.

291
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,640
Start her on IV interferon.
I'll go tell Wilson.

292
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,838
Good idea.

293
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,542
And I'll go nap, because
I was concussed last night

294
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,243
and had a heart attack this morning.

295
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,286
I'll tell Wilson. You go sleep.

296
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,566
Hepatitis B is a lame diagnosis.

297
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,838
Oh, God, I get less
rest when I'm asleep.

298
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,480
I rise from the dead and
that's reaction I get?

299
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,743
I'm sorry. If I had known,

300
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,115
I would have started a
breakaway Jewish sect.

301
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,448
Hep B fits.

302
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,883
Why are you doing that?

303
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,949
Because Hep B doesn't fit.

304
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,862
Turn her over.

305
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,265
We're about to start her
second course of interferon.

306
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,106
Which she might not need
once you turn her over.

307
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,950
The small of her back.

308
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,247
She's bruised. Why is that significant?

309
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,721
Look closer.

310
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,618
A rash.

311
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,025
How'd you know what was
on the small of her back?

312
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,689
Well, either I'm still asleep,
or I'm starting to remember.

313
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,870
Looks like an influenza rash.

314
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,876
The flu wouldn't be killing
the organs one by one.

315
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,343
Dermatomyositis.

316
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,778
Wouldn't speed up her heart.

317
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,510
Maybe it's an allergic
reaction to the interferon?

318
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,577
Yes, the symptom I saw on the
bus was a rare interferon allergy

319
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,747
that flares up two
days before you take it.

320
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,290
How'd you see the rash down there?

321
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,921
I don't know. Maybe she leaned over.

322
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,261
Maybe it's not a rash at
all. Could be an abscess.

323
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,798
Thirteen, stick a needle in there.

324
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,063
If there's pus, Foreman's right.

325
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,568
Ultrasound is safer.

326
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,764
I'm not asking you to stick a
needle all the way through her.

327
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,774
Taub, you do it. No. Wait, I can do it.

328
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,844
No, apparently, you can't.

329
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,050
It's not fluctuant.

330
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,190
Clear, it's not pus.

331
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,725
Means it's vesicular.

332
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,027
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

333
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,221
We had dinner with a friend
last week. We walked their dogs.

334
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,699
I guess she could've gotten a tick.

335
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,633
It's treatable, doxycycline.

336
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,228
Allow eight hours for the
antibiotics to take effect,

337
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,297
then we warm her up, shock her heart.

338
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,636
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

339
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,711
If we're wrong, restarting
her heart could kill her.

340
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,177
Run blood cultures first.

341
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,737
Fastest way to test is to treat.

342
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,442
If we're wrong, still should give
us time to try something else.

343
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,681
We are not starting her heart
until we're 100% certain.

344
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,848
We're never 100% certain.

345
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,828
Run the blood cultures.

346
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,298
After we get confirmation,
we'll restart her heart.

347
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,865
He's wrong. And you know he's wrong.

348
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,271
You can't change your mind just
because a family member starts crying.

349
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,603
They're always scared.

350
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,270
I said run the blood cultures.

351
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,493
Sorry. Wide stance.

352
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,628
You're right.

353
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,003
I'm screwing up.

354
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,572
Why are you screwing up?

355
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,039
I didn't even like her.

356
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,507
Did you hate her?

357
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,010
Not enough to want her dead.

358
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,945
So it's not guilt.
That just leaves fear.

359
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,546
A young woman dying.

360
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,985
A young doctor dying, in
fact. That sound familiar?

361
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,552
Yeah, I'm at risk for Huntington's.

362
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:31,987
I've dealt with it.

363
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,588
By not getting tested.

364
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,331
Dealing with it by not dealing with it.

365
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,766
It's clearly working beautifully.

366
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,361
You're the champion of not
dealing with your problems.

367
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,497
My grandson gave me
a mug that says that.

368
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,643
Okay. Enough hand-holding.

369
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,803
Deal with it, get back in
there, or pack up your stuff.

370
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,473
You're screwing up this
case worse than I am.

371
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,675
House is gonna kill the patient.

372
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,483
What are you... What are you doing?

373
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,519
She's up to 80 degrees.

374
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,923
We're gonna restart her heart.

375
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,016
No, you're not.

376
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,529
There's still time to undo
this. Cool her back down.

377
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,928
You weren't taking the safe approach.

378
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,023
We've got to know if the
antibiotics are working.

379
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,693
Her EEG's slowed.

380
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,730
Amber.

381
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,332
Amber.

382
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,368
Well done.

383
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,503
We still don't know what it is,

384
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,444
but you've just let
it spread to her brain!

385
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,350
This is exactly what I said would
happen. It's in her brain now.

386
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,354
The brain involvement
gives us a new symptom.

387
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,185
That wouldn't be there if you hadn't...

388
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,656
It's where the disease was going.

389
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,715
We needed to know that.

390
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,090
This was not your decision to make!

391
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,322
You went behind my back.
You went behind House's back.

392
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,864
Inside voices.

393
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,297
House wanted to warm her up.

394
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,336
You just guilted him
into changing his mind.

395
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,269
Heart, liver, rash and now her brain.

396
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,936
Auto-immune fits best. Crash
trauma could've set it off.

397
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,209
Start her on prednisone,
then we'll warm her up again.

398
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,682
House, if this is some other infection,

399
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,687
the steroids will
trash her immune system.

400
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,024
He's the attending. You're the family.

401
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,028
Go spend more time with the patient.

402
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,739
You can't do this.

403
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,141
That's not a good argument.

404
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,041
It's not an argument at all. I'm sorry.

405
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:04,301
Cuddy's right. I was
afraid to do anything.

406
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:08,072
I thought if everything just
stopped, it would be okay.

407
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,273
And it's gonna be.

408
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,077
Taub's starting treatment,
we're doing everything...

409
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,310
Not everything.

410
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,482
Before you warm her up...

411
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,959
You said you wanted to
try deep brain stimulation.

412
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,255
But there's no reason.

413
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,823
We know the symptom. We know what I saw.

414
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,090
What if it's not the rash?

415
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,359
What if you saw the
rash in the ambulance,

416
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,991
or when we were putting her on bypass?

417
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:33,969
What if there is still something
else stuck inside your head?

418
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,681
You think I should risk
my life to save Amber's.

419
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,649
I'm inserting the IPG probe
into your ventral hypothalamus.

420
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,015
Give me 3 volts.

421
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,056
<i>I can't hear him. Can't hear who?</i>

422
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,095
Everything's in black and white.

423
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,931
Who was talking? Is Amber there?

424
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,438
You're supposed to be jolting
my hypothalamus. Not petting it.

425
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,701
We don't want to overload it.

426
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,901
As long as I'm risking my life,

427
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,705
I might as well be watching a talkie.

428
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,040
Increasing from 3 to 5 volts.

429
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,051
Sending impulse.

430
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,055
You're not getting them back.

431
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,961
Hey! You take my keys, you
gotta give me a phone call.

432
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,409
Who are you calling?

433
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,782
Dial-a-Wilson.

434
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,256
I was on call.

435
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,227
Amber was home.

436
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,496
I told her to find you,
have you pick me up.

437
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,589
I said to find Wilson.

438
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,749
He's working.

439
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,350
And I'm willing to suffer
this indignity on his behalf.

440
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,657
Does she seem sick?

441
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,358
Not yet.

442
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,592
Come on, time to go.

443
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:21,606
Need another round and a drink for
what passes for a lady around here.

444
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,502
What's your poison?
Nothing. We're leaving.

445
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,272
We're leaving, leaving, leaving. Cosmos.

446
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,005
I remember Wilson
buying cranberry juice.

447
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,144
I'll have another, and
she'll have a Cosmopolitan.

448
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,346
The obstinate drunk
thing is not flattering.

449
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,785
Come on, you called for a ride.

450
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,853
Drink your drink, or
I'll drink them both.

451
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,655
One, and you leave voluntarily.

452
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,764
Let's go.

453
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,969
Hey! Need another Cosmo, here.

454
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,676
She sneezed.

455
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:05,673
What color is it?

456
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,477
Thanks.

457
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,422
Looks like snot. Seems like a cold.

458
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,830
Nothing else?

459
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,560
No.

460
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,238
Where are you going?

461
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,710
You think I paid?

462
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,441
House, what are you
doing? You can barely walk.

463
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,043
Go home. I'll take the bus.

464
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,679
Hey, someone's gotta pay for this.

465
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,122
Hi.

466
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,127
You forgot something.

467
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,636
Boy, you don't give up, do you?

468
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,638
Yeah, I'm an idiot that way.

469
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,433
You doing this for me, or for Wilson?

470
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,875
For Wilson.

471
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,381
Well, then, it's even more impressive.

472
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,784
Damn. Do you have a Kleenex?

473
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,221
I got a sleeve.

474
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,782
I got two, actually.

475
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,293
Gonna need more than that.
I'm getting that nasty flu.

476
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,928
Is that it? The flu? Is
there any rare complication?

477
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:37,171
No. It'll explain the
rash, but nothing else.

478
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,104
Unless...

479
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,939
What?

480
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,157
Don't do it.

481
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,963
It wasn't the flu.

482
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,501
It's what she did for it.
She has amantadine poisoning.

483
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,803
The crash destroyed her kidneys,

484
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,469
her body couldn't filter the drugs,

485
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:18,107
she ODs on amantadine,
explains the heart, the liver...

486
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,778
We just need to start on her
dialysis and flush the drugs out.

487
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,687
What? What's wrong?

488
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,455
Amantadine binds with proteins.

489
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,054
Dialysis can't clear
it out of the blood.

490
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,898
There's nothing we can do.

491
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,075
I'm so sorry.

492
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,846
Amber.

493
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,387
Amber.

494
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,193
He's seizing. Wilson! I need help, here.

495
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,540
House suffered a
complex partial seizure.

496
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:21,540
The violent shaking widened his
skull fracture, causing a brain bleed.

497
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,137
<i>We won't know if there's
any cognitive impairment</i>

498
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,682
<i>until he's out of the coma.</i>

499
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,851
<i>He was right about the amantadine.</i>

500
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,989
<i>Amber's body couldn't filter it out.</i>

501
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,818
<i>That's what caused her heart
to beat too fast for too long.</i>

502
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,724
<i>It caused irreparable structural damage.</i>

503
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,026
<i>Didn't matter if they
shocked her or froze her or...</i>

504
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,467
<i>Her heart was dead once it
stopped in that ambulance.</i>

505
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,497
What about a new heart? Transplant?

506
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,804
All of her organs are
damaged. She can't qualify.

507
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,575
There's nothing we can do.
Nothing we could have done.

508
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,722
We should call time of death.

509
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,791
Technically, she's still alive.

510
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,597
Could probably survive a
few more hours on bypass.

511
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,564
We could wean her off
anesthesia. Wake her up.

512
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,663
Give you a chance to...

513
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,538
It'd be cruel. Don't...

514
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,912
Wake Amber up. See her again.

515
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,608
Tell her what she means to you.

516
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,779
Wake her up to tell her that she's...

517
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:47,789
You are waking her up so that you
can both say goodbye to each other.

518
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,398
She would want it.

519
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,512
Hey.

520
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,491
You're in the hospital.

521
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,656
I'm on bypass.

522
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,126
Yeah.

523
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,733
Do you remember what happened?

524
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,501
I got on the bus.

525
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,117
I shouldn't have gotten on the bus.

526
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,881
No. No. It's not your fault.

527
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,517
It's not your fault.

528
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,784
How bad?

529
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:27,493
You had tachycardia, complicated
by complete renal failure.

530
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:36,039
The tachycardia degenerated into
V-fib, followed by hepatic failure.

531
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,718
The flu pills...

532
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,086
Yeah.

533
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,259
I'm dead.

534
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,564
I love you.

535
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,076
I love you, too.

536
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,421
We should say goodbye.

537
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,758
She didn't even like us.

538
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:32,921
We liked her.

539
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,059
Did we?

540
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,395
We do now.

541
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,995
What do we say?

542
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,267
We don't need to say anything.

543
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,681
I'm tired.

544
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,555
I think it's time to go to sleep.

545
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,485
Just a little longer.

546
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:44,825
We're always gonna want
just a little longer.

547
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,996
I don't think I can do it.

548
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,838
It's okay.

549
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:57,938
It's not okay.

550
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,246
Why is it okay with you?
Why aren't you angry?

551
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:09,919
That's not the last feeling

552
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,156
I want to experience.

553
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,283
BP stable.

554
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,516
Still non-responsive.

555
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,587
Pupils are equal, round and reactive.

556
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,819
Heart rate's normal.

557
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,629
<i>Respiratory rate is...</i>

558
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,143
You're dead.

559
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,383
Everybody dies.

560
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,247
Am I dead?

561
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,588
Not yet.

562
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,289
I should be.

563
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,388
Why?

564
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,799
Because life shouldn't be random.

565
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:03,433
Because lonely, misanthropic drug
addicts should die in bus crashes,

566
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,170
and young do-gooders in love who
get dragged out of their apartment

567
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,803
in the middle of the night
should walk away clean.

568
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,482
Self-pity isn't like you.

569
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,916
I'm branching out from
self-loathing and self-destruction.

570
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,152
Wilson is going to hate me.

571
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,154
You kind of deserve it.

572
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,999
He's my best friend.

573
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,263
I know.

574
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,640
What now?

575
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,708
I stay here with you.

576
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,609
Get off the bus.

577
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:47,912
I can't. Why not?

578
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,052
Because...

579
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,960
Because it doesn't hurt here.

580
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,394
I lied.

581
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:08,031
I don't want to be in pain and
I don't want to be miserable.

582
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,166
And I don't want him to hate me.

583
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,677
Well... You can't
always get what you want.

584
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,881
Hey. I'm here.

585
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,751
Blink if you can hear me.

586
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,219
No. Don't try to talk.

587
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,426
Just rest.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
