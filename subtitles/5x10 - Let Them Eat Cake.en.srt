1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,771
Do you want a lean body for summer?

2
00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:04,656
Well, the time to start is now.

3
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:08,228
No gimmicks, no crash diets,
and absolutely no drugs.

4
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:11,608
Think healthy and be healthy.
You can start now.

5
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:15,059
Just pick up the phone
and become the best you, you can be.

6
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:17,558
Cut! Going again.

7
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:19,393
Sorry, did I mess up the commercial?

8
00:00:19,563 --> 00:00:21,993
- No, it's fine. Are you okay?
- I think it's cramps.

9
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:23,606
Oh, I have burning on my side.

10
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,108
Sit down, take a few minutes,
and catch your breath.

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:28,507
- Everybody else keep running!
- We're not filming.

12
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:30,988
We don't do this for the cameras.
We do it for ourselves.

13
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:34,450
- We can't go with him sitting there.
- Fine, but that felt phony.

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,243
At least let me get
a little workout.

15
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,371
Maybe if I'm breathing
as hard as they are,

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,551
I won't seem
like such an evil task master.

17
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:41,832
OK, take five, guys.

18
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,046
- How you feeling?
- I think I'm ready to do this.

19
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,466
You sure? That's it.
That's the way to fight through.

20
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,343
Concentrate on those knees.

21
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,345
Lean into it. And lift.

22
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:57,348
- Lifting.
- Come on, push it!

23
00:00:58,022 --> 00:00:59,892
Come on, you're almost at the top.

24
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:03,104
Those eight steps are the difference
between fat and thin.

25
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:04,522
Seven, six,

26
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:05,856
five, four!

27
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:07,120
One more!

28
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,618
Nice job!

29
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,404
You feel that burn?

30
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,406
That's your body carving out
its new shape.

31
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,157
- New shape
- Don't sit.

32
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:16,826
Just take it slow on the way down.

33
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:18,703
Oh, boy.

34
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:24,750
Are you OK?

35
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,011
You okay?

36
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:41,684
House - Season 05 Episode 10
"Let Them Eat Cake"

37
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,762
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak

38
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,042
www.house-fr.com

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,048
Any idea why we're getting
half as many requests for you as usual?

40
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,222
Democrats'health care plan?

41
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:24,815
At least we have one case
that looks intriguing.

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,229
30-year-old fitness trainer
suddenly can't breathe.

43
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:28,898
Collapses and breaks her ankle.

44
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:30,537
That's it?

45
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:33,091
You're not gonna argue
why this case is beneath you?

46
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:35,737
No point. I'm in an elevator.
Can't run away.

47
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:37,698
You can't run away anyway.

48
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,200
That's just mean.

49
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,621
Why are we still together?

50
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:49,449
We are going to our office.

51
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,712
Pronoun confusion.

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,294
Starts kicking in once you pass
child-bearing age.

53
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,760
Well, that's just mean.
My office was recently destroyed.

54
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,429
I thought I'd use the office
of the doctor directly responsible.

55
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:03,891
The patient holding the gun to my head
was the one directly responsible.

56
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:06,215
My desk won't fit in his cell.

57
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,145
You can use our outer office.

58
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,490
Where's Foreman and Thirteen?

59
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,202
Down in the GRC.

60
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:26,205
- She started her clinical trials today.
- What's Cuddy doing in your office?

61
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:29,260
Other than throwing off
the feng shui with her ass

62
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:31,752
that faces all eight sides
of the bagua at once?

63
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:33,447
These walls aren't soundproof.

64
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:34,797
I'm well aware.

65
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,868
Normal CT means
that her lung problem

66
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:39,260
has the distinction of having
nothing to do with her lungs.

67
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,179
Steroids... No one looks this fit
without cheating.

68
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,630
Anabolic steroids hack away
at the immune system,

69
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:46,745
left her open
to a pulmonary infection.

70
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:49,436
Muscles and curves.

71
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,105
My penis is so confused.

72
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,675
She's not on steroids.
Her program's all about getting

73
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,985
in shape naturally,
exercising, eating right.

74
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,736
And you know this because?

75
00:03:57,907 --> 00:03:59,738
She has infomercials
to sell her dvds.

76
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:01,740
What? I'm up late a lot.

77
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:03,949
And you actually believe
what you see on tv.

78
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:06,245
- Go run the labs.
- The labs are back.

79
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:08,080
And there's no sign of steroid use.

80
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:10,165
Can someone please read her file?

81
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:13,023
Can someone please stop
backseat differentialating?

82
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:14,378
What about allergies?

83
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,381
She goes jogging every morning.
Inhales car fumes during rush hour.

84
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,343
Perfect, except that she was jogging
half a mile from the nearest road.

85
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,346
In the cold.

86
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:27,308
Cold air hits the lungs,
sets off an attack.

87
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,060
- Exercise-induced asthma.
- Nice try.

88
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,605
Except EIA doesn't account
for the elevated BP,

89
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:34,398
if you'd read the file.

90
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:35,900
Come on.

91
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,152
Before the shrieking harpy
melts my brain.

92
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,005
- Her BP's fine.
- I know.

93
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,058
Exercise-induced asthma
actually fits.

94
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:47,871
I know. You know. She can't know.

95
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,589
The only good way to test for EIA

96
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:51,934
is to recreate the conditions
in which the attack occurred.

97
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,835
But we can't exactly make her
run out in the cold on a broken ankle.

98
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,670
Get creative.

99
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:31,497
It's gonna be okay.

100
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,603
Any shortness of breath?
Tightness in your chest?

101
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:43,969
- Feeling pretty good actually.
- Not even breathing hard.

102
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,303
O2 stats and lung capacity
are well within range.

103
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:48,302
Your cuff's slipping down.
You want to stop?

104
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:50,749
I'd rather not.
Haven't had any exercise in two days.

105
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,018
Take it you don't get
a lot of fat in your diet.

106
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,279
I take it from your tone
you think that's a bad thing.

107
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:58,111
- Do you ever indulge?
- There's more to life than indulging

108
00:05:58,236 --> 00:06:00,109
- your every whim.
- I didn't say every.

109
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,778
But a whim every now and then
can make life a little...

110
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:04,363
You okay? Trouble breathing?

111
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:06,115
No, I feel fine. Why?

112
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:12,338
No pulse.

113
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,325
This isn't asthma.

114
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,006
There a lot of other people
in the trial?

115
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,550
I'm taking over the people
that already started it at mercy.

116
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,040
So pretty full.

117
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,055
Stop.

118
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:31,564
One more time. No talking.

119
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,937
I shouldn't be here.

120
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:38,731
It's nepotism.

121
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:41,925
I know the guy running
the drug trials, so I get a spot.

122
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,653
You have huntington's,
so you get a spot.

123
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:48,612
One more time.

124
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:50,826
Just the fingers. No mouth.

125
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:56,457
The point of this thing
is to improve neural cell longevity.

126
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,876
Which doesn't matter before symptoms.
You should give my...

127
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,085
Shut up.

128
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,176
You can stop feeling guilty.

129
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,764
Your best tapping rate
was 004 taps per millisecond.

130
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,642
Means your nerves
have started degenerating.

131
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:33,893
You wanna work in here?

132
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:35,412
Fine.

133
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:36,667
Me too.

134
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:39,458
We'll split the desk, 50-50.

135
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,251
That side's yours.
This side's mine.

136
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,275
You're right.

137
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:46,507
There's plenty of space here.
Neither one of us needs all of it.

138
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:49,489
So that's your strategy.
Taking the high road.

139
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:51,345
It's not gonna work.

140
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:53,300
Did you say something?

141
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:56,141
I couldn't hear you from all the way
over here on my side of the desk.

142
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,261
- Patient's heart stopped.
- We shocked her back to sinus rhythm.

143
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:03,445
She's stable. Test didn't set it off.
Her EKG was normal.

144
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:07,736
She's consistent.

145
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,489
The lung problems had nothing
to do with her lungs.

146
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,908
A heart problem that has
nothing do with her heart.

147
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:14,618
Something is strangling her system.

148
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:16,141
Carcinoid tumor?

149
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,258
Find it, cut it out.

150
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,121
Can a leaking breast implant
cause joint pain?

151
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,011
No.

152
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:35,402
And she clearly
doesn't have implants.

153
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,224
Or joint pain. What's going on?

154
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:39,198
Got another patient.

155
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:42,504
I set up an online
second opinion clinic.

156
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:45,571
People who don't like
or trust their doctorse mail symptoms.

157
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:48,050
I can knock off four
or five cases over lunch.

158
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,127
Clear two grand
by emailing them back.

159
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,947
Ascending colon's clean.

160
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:54,356
- That's got to be illegal.
- Only in 9 states,

161
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:55,964
and this isn't one of them.

162
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,627
Legal notice spells out
it doesn't replace doctor's visits,

163
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:00,664
so there's no opportunity
for malpractice.

164
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:03,131
- How come you haven't said anything?
- It's no big secret.

165
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:04,418
I'm not very chatty.

166
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,799
You told us when you renewed your
subscription to national geographic.

167
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:10,746
Small intestine looks clean.
Moving into the pylorus.

168
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:12,801
So you don't mind if I tell House?

169
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:15,543
Actually House may sort
of mind because I

170
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:18,161
because I sort of set it up
in House's name.

171
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,350
Nothing in the bile duct.

172
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:23,251
And by "set it up in his name,"
you mean?

173
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:26,455
I mean, it's Dr. Gregory House's
second opinion clinic

174
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,193
with medical advice direct
from Dr. Gregory House.

175
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:31,524
You're insane.

176
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:33,389
With two days to live.

177
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:36,571
- House is never gonna find out.
- He will if I tell him.

178
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,483
Or you cut me in for 30%
and I keep your secret safe.

179
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:43,090
- That's blackmail.
- Yes.

180
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,932
Moving into the...

181
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,048
That's her stomach?

182
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,883
It's the size of a shot glass.

183
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,055
Because our patient's
a big, fat cheater.

184
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:03,313
Subtle.

185
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:06,021
No way you geniuses
could've spotted this.

186
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:09,024
Gastric bypass surgery.
She had her stomach stapled.

187
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:11,388
Then had the records
from her files pulled

188
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:13,465
So it wouldn't ruin their dvd sales.

189
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,168
Can you do this outside?

190
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,158
I could, but that would defeat
the purpose of doing it here.

191
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:22,676
- Where are the smart guys?
- If you mean Foreman and Thirteen,

192
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:25,582
apparently the first appointment
of the drug trial's an all-day thing.

193
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,292
I said yes to this?

194
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,280
Her gastric bypass procedure
could...

195
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:31,838
Forget the bypass.
Treat her like a fat girl.

196
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,501
Should we treat her like
a 60-year-old asian man too?

197
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:36,979
- She's not fat.
- Not on the outside.

198
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,846
But on the inside,
she's still tons of fun.

199
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:44,097
When she was obese, she probably had
type two diabetes.

200
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:45,769
Could've left her with nerve damage.

201
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,926
Ten points for doing what I said.

202
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:50,238
Minus ten points for doing it badly.

203
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:53,986
If this was diabetes-induced nerve
damage, it would've kicked in years ago.

204
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,120
Have you seen my balls?

205
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,027
Can you hold on a second?

206
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:02,411
My balls. Have you seen my balls?

207
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:04,563
Giant one and the red one.

208
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:07,013
- Your plan isn't gonna work.
- Of course it is.

209
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:09,207
I try to make you miserable
to make you leave.

210
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:10,405
You deny that.

211
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,046
You try to make me miserable,
I'll stop making you miserable.

212
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:14,589
Eventually you will leave,

213
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,957
citing reasons that have
nothing to do with misery.

214
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:18,642
You're not bothering me.

215
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:20,470
Step one complete.

216
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,045
I'm gonna call you from my cell.

217
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,552
And then I will come back in here.

218
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,897
Yeah, I just had to explain
to him that I had his balls

219
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,628
and he's not getting them back.

220
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,038
'Scuse me.

221
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,929
Sleep apnea explains...

222
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:37,821
Apnea would've disappeared
when she shrank.

223
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:40,324
Not if it destroyed the musculature
of her trachea.

224
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,320
Apnea cuts off oxygen to the brain.

225
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:44,453
- The resulting neurological...
- She been snoring?

226
00:11:44,714 --> 00:11:47,404
- She didn't mention it.
- Did she mention feeling tired

227
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,374
- after a full night's sleep?
- No, but...

228
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:50,913
This isn't apnea.

229
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:54,755
And this is a stupid room
to be doing a ddx in.

230
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:01,553
Cliff notes.

231
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,308
Gastric bypass only makes
her skinny on the outside.

232
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,728
Inside, we have heart and lung issues
not caused by heart and lung issues.

233
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:12,282
Private area, House. It can wait.

234
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,865
You need to consider side effects
from her gastric surgery.

235
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,903
- Forget the bypass.
- Let the dying girl finish.

236
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,534
You said forget the...

237
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:22,440
Dr. Thirteen has the floor.

238
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:24,593
Bypass could create
malabsorption issues.

239
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:26,536
- Leads to low potassium.
- Very stupid.

240
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,498
Her potassium's fine.

241
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:30,922
But her intestines aren't.

242
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:32,962
Gastric bypass
could cause malabsorption

243
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,859
by creating a blind loop of bowel.

244
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:37,506
It ulcerates during exercise.
Bacteria get loose in the bloodstream.

245
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,050
- Migrate to the heart and lungs.
- Very not stupid.

246
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:44,262
Bacteria in the bowels means
there's bacteria in the poop.

247
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:45,963
Get some and test it.

248
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:48,558
He could've come up with sibo
anywhere else in the hospital.

249
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,560
You didn't need to come
and screw with us.

250
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,027
But her wrong idea
led to his right one.

251
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,708
It was vital screwing.

252
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,242
We think your surgery might've caused
an infection called sibo.

253
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,279
Stool tests will help us to confirm.

254
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,629
Put some of what
you're full of in here.

255
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:08,954
If surgery could somehow
make you taller,

256
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:10,896
wouldn't you do it?

257
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:12,763
Sure.

258
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:15,620
But I wouldn't call a meeting
of the lollipop guild

259
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:18,403
and tell them they can grow
if they work real hard at it.

260
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:20,672
I don't tell anyone
not to get gastric bypass.

261
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:23,635
I tell them how to get healthy.
How to improve their lives.

262
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:26,585
Yeah, by telling them to do what
you were unwilling to.

263
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,265
I was willing to do anything.

264
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,184
Thyroid, hormones, crash diets...
None of it worked.

265
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,228
My body was like a prison.

266
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:36,178
When I got the surgery,
I got healthy.

267
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,067
And when I got healthy, I got happy.

268
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,321
I'm not sure you're happy.
But if you are,

269
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,365
being healthy didn't do it.
Being pretty did.

270
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:47,348
Poop in the bedpan.

271
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:50,315
House's office?

272
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:51,466
Really?

273
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:53,719
Did he send you here
to beg for it back?

274
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,668
There are dozens of other doctors...

275
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,674
Other doctors actually use
their offices

276
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,450
for crazy stuff
like seeing patients.

277
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:02,020
Not throwing a ball against the wall
and calling it work.

278
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,183
It's his process.
That ball saves lives.

279
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:06,055
Did he give you talking points?

280
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,929
Yeah, but I added one of my own.

281
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,671
Don't take his office and pretend

282
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:12,541
like all you're doing
is taking his office.

283
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,965
You chose his room
because you want to be there.

284
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,117
But sitting near him and hoping
isn't gonna get it done.

285
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:24,035
Leave here now,
or I'll take your office.

286
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:26,375
No, you won't.

287
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:34,250
The boob lady emailed me again
complaining of chronic fatigue now.

288
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,458
She's convinced the implants
are responsible.

289
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:38,239
- They're not.
- I told her.

290
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:40,383
She says something is,
and if I don't find out what

291
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:42,736
she's gonna complain
to the licensing board.

292
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,278
- It's not funny.
- It is.

293
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:47,385
You just can't appreciate it
because it's gonna destroy your career.

294
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:49,534
What happened?

295
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,806
He call Foreman
"clean and articulate" again?

296
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:53,485
This is surprising.

297
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,477
Clinic patients just whining.

298
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,103
What's the poop?

299
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:59,364
It's gonna take about an hour
to spin down the sample.

300
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,900
- What are we looking for?
- You don't know?

301
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:05,153
I'm doing my famous
Socrates impression.

302
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,168
- Think I really nailed the accent.
- High fat content indicates sibo.

303
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:11,450
And what does fat do in water?

304
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:12,744
It floats.

305
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,579
What else floats in water?

306
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:20,001
Correct answer is a duck.

307
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:23,450
If it doesn't float,

308
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,382
Kutner missed the boat.

309
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,316
Looks like I was wrong
to dismiss apnea.

310
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:39,396
You guys can stay up all night
gloating in the sleep lab.

311
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:48,796
What about all that scar tissue
around the implant? Could that be...

312
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,807
That amount of encapsulation's
normal.

313
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:53,436
- I gotta tell her something.
- Tell to find a decent plastic surgeon

314
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,939
- who can correct the placement...
- That's what she wants,

315
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:58,729
- she's sick and she's lopsided.
- Tell her it's a virus.

316
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:01,308
It probably is, and it'll get her
off your back for a few...

317
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,049
Emmy's EEG is flatlining.

318
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,299
Where is she?

319
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,593
I looked for you guys
in the control room,

320
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,556
- but you seemed busy.
- Get off there.

321
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:17,703
Last time you exercised,
you had a cardiac incident.

322
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,751
- I feel fine.
- You felt fine last time.

323
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:21,999
I only slept a couple hours,
but I feel great.

324
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:24,657
- Can I get one of those machines?
- You're running on a broken ankle.

325
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:27,027
- It doesn't hurt.
- And your leg is bleeding.

326
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,319
You feel that?

327
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:36,568
What does that mean?

328
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:44,075
Numbness in her left foot
is ascending into her leg.

329
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,398
How did she manage
to sneak out for a run?

330
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:48,564
She said she needed to use
the bathroom.

331
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,650
You two get the results
of the sleep apnea test,

332
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,515
or did those need to use
the bathroom too?

333
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,526
Alpha waves on the EEG ruled it out.

334
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,393
I was mixing some hydrogen sulfide

335
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:03,507
for good and valid reasons
and must've spilled some on my side.

336
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:05,982
- Did it waft over to your side?
- Cunning plan.

337
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,194
You do realize it's gonna stink
for hours on both sides.

338
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,821
Would you look at the time?

339
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,004
I hope your patient
isn't still sick...

340
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,741
Forcing you to stay here all night.

341
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,191
Numbness means
her nerves are breaking down.

342
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:24,249
- Or her brain.
- Or both.

343
00:17:24,706 --> 00:17:27,127
- We've gotta go.
- Let me finish. I'll meet you there.

344
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,507
You were 15 minutes late yesterday.
I don't want you to develop bad habits.

345
00:17:30,904 --> 00:17:33,422
Appreciate the life lesson,
but 15 minutes give or take

346
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:36,005
isn't gonna make a difference.
Get started on your other patients.

347
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,097
I'll be down there
when we're done here.

348
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,882
Way to know where
your bread is buttered, sister.

349
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:41,768
Up high!

350
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,770
If the problem's in brain,
it could be MS.

351
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:45,349
Or early onset Parkinson's.

352
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:47,774
If it's her nerves,
it could be transverse myelitis.

353
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:49,690
Or a million other things.

354
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:52,287
We're gonna stay in the dark
until we can figure out

355
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:53,747
if her electrical problem

356
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,877
is in her power station
or in the high-tension wires.

357
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,023
Power station's the brain.
Wires are the nerves.

358
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,435
Go run an NCV test.

359
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:12,161
The test will measure the time
it'll take this electrical impulse

360
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:13,633
to travel along your nerves.

361
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:15,815
- Will it hurt?
- No. Give me your arm.

362
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,512
You can ask nicely.

363
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:23,309
I learned at med school
you don't actually cure with kindness.

364
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:25,896
You're right.

365
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,975
I'm a hypocrite.

366
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,763
But I don't have a choice.

367
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:32,957
Not really interested
in your rationalizations.

368
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:36,531
If I'm open about the gastric bypass,
no one would listen to me anymore.

369
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,566
- You mean no one would buy your dvds.
- It's not about the dvd sales.

370
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,205
I'm helping people.

371
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,379
My clients
are making themselves healthy.

372
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:46,158
They're living better lives.

373
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:50,240
Can you honestly tell me
you've never done anything hypocritical?

374
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:54,834
I'm sure you had good reasons.

375
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:00,513
Give me your arm...

376
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:01,639
please?

377
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:09,712
Keep your arm raised.

378
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:14,109
Does this mean something
is wrong with my nerves?

379
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,261
It's your muscles.

380
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,115
We don't need to run this test.

381
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:20,992
It's not what we thought.

382
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:46,475
She has muscle weakness.
Could indicate myasthenia gravis.

383
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:49,293
Could be some kind of toxin.

384
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,687
Excuse me, are you going up
to the personnel floors?

385
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:53,107
I'm going to see Dr. House.

386
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:56,635
- Do you have an appointment with him?
- We've been emailing.

387
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,734
Joint pain and fatigue
thanks to these.

388
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,906
I'm sure it's nothing.
Oh, and now this.

389
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:08,121
- He's actually downstairs.
- Gone. Gone for the day.

390
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,376
But, we work for him.
We can set you up in the E.R.

391
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:17,607
The antibiotics will make her
feel better. She's out here by morning.

392
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:19,615
- If it is a staph infection.
- It's gotta be.

393
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,882
She has sleeves of tattoos
and piercings from God knows where.

394
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,676
She has muscle weakness.
Could indicate myasthenia gravis.

395
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,182
I had the weirdest dream.

396
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:33,104
You guys did the test

397
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:35,857
in a reasonable amount of time
and came back here

398
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,998
before I had time to fall asleep.

399
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:40,613
You still smell that?

400
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,491
Maybe you should just let her
have your office.

401
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:45,604
Or...

402
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,039
She sends one of yours to the hospital,
send one of hers to the morgue.

403
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,383
It's not myasthenia gravis.

404
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:56,462
Her breathing's improving
and the weakness is in her extremities.

405
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:01,294
Could be a botulinum reaction.

406
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,901
I don't think sabotaging
your boss'office

407
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,390
is a wise counterattack.

408
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,725
All that is needed
for evil to succeed

409
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,462
is for good men to do nothing.

410
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:11,756
She probably used a lot of botox
to tighten up her skin.

411
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:12,763
True.

412
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,649
Could also be any kind
of heavy metal toxicity.

413
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,775
PPS or arsenic
from eating too much seafood.

414
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,933
Cadmium from bad bottled water.

415
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:24,103
Lead or nickel from canned
fruits or natural grains.

416
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,987
I don't think replacing that
was part of the renovation plans.

417
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:32,168
It is now.

418
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,603
Lucky for us, we can treat
all those toxins

419
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,840
with the same thing: chelation.

420
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:49,055
You never showed up.

421
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,167
Get out of my house.

422
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,499
I wanted to find proof
that you were slipping back

423
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,353
into your self-destructive pattern.

424
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,063
Confirm you weren't worth my time.

425
00:21:58,035 --> 00:21:59,051
Instead,

426
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:00,704
I found this.

427
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:05,114
You followed all of my instructions
to the letter.

428
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:07,615
Probably better
than any patient I have.

429
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:10,578
Why are you the only one
who can't show up for appointments?

430
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:13,283
I came down right after
I was finished with House.

431
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:15,442
You were in your office
with another patient.

432
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,925
And there was another patient
in the waiting room.

433
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:20,818
Janice.

434
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:24,841
I'm well-aware of what's gonna happen
to my body over the next 8 to 10 years.

435
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:28,441
I do not need a visual reminder
every time I walk into that place.

436
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,408
That's understandable.

437
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:38,040
It's human.

438
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,222
And you need to get over it.

439
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:44,944
Now you show up on time tomorrow,

440
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,529
or you don't show up at all.

441
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:54,671
Your mom is leaving.

442
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:57,637
You're gonna regret this
the rest of your life.

443
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:04,839
The chelation didn't work.
Her muscles are still deteriorating.

444
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,005
Rules out toxins

445
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,804
So what else can go wrong
when the hindenburg deflates?

446
00:23:10,128 --> 00:23:11,931
Why aren't we doing this
in your office?

447
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,351
Obviously because it would be stupid
to do it in an office with no furniture.

448
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:17,061
Cuddy...

449
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:19,270
Overreacted to my overreaction.

450
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,590
Coronaro-cardiac fistula.

451
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:24,155
- Even a small hole could cause...
- This started in the lungs,

452
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,487
not the heart.

453
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:29,572
And why are you leaning
on a 45-degree angle away from Foreman?

454
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:33,369
- I'm sitting straight.
- Trouble in the land of false hope?

455
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:36,871
Everything's fine.
Austrian syndrome.

456
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:38,886
Nice deflection.

457
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:41,649
But our patient doesn't drink.
She's a health nut.

458
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:44,505
And even if I was a cynical guy
and thought that she was a liar,

459
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,918
I'd have done a tox screen which
would've come back negative for alcohol.

460
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,919
You should come
to these gatherings more often.

461
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:51,761
Keep you from looking like an idiot.

462
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:59,137
Are you making book, or did something
else happen to our patient?

463
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,412
Personal.
I'll put it on vibrate.

464
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:03,728
Guillain-barre.

465
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:06,086
Usually starts as a muscle pain

466
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,960
patients compare to the pain
of over-exercising.

467
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:11,317
So who's paging you?
Your wife?

468
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,715
Does it worry you
that she paged Kutner first?

469
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,420
Guillain-barre fits.

470
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:17,411
Patient didn't notice
the initial symptoms

471
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,747
because it's no different
than how she feels every day.

472
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,953
Her muscle weakness is the precursor
to full paralysis.

473
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,811
Gastric bypass probably set it off.

474
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:30,013
Oh, at what price beauty?

475
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:32,437
Go start her on plasmapheresis.

476
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:51,529
- Can you stop singing?
- Musical automatism.

477
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,930
She could be having
a partial seizure right now.

478
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:56,380
- You need to get House.
- Dee dee!

479
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:59,078
Yelling is not going
to be an effective treatment.

480
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,291
She's faking.
It's a cry for attention.

481
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:03,181
Her brain could be misfiring.

482
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:07,089
A rare neurological disorder is far
more likely than a cry for attention.

483
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,503
I mean, nothing about this woman
screams "look at me."

484
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:11,673
On the other hand, look at her.

485
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:16,221
She needs
a full neurological work-up.

486
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,592
Get House!

487
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,176
Ultimate irony.

488
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,482
Killed myself
trying to make myself healthy.

489
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,897
You're not dying.

490
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:29,902
Okay?
This disease is manageable.

491
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:34,073
Better start getting used
to that wheelchair.

492
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,084
- Self-pity doesn't suit you.
- Just take me down to the...

493
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:41,996
You're strong enough to walk.
Come on, get your ass out of bed

494
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:43,332
and walk.

495
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,680
Could be an aneurysm.

496
00:25:57,922 --> 00:26:01,058
We've got to control her blood pressure.
Start her on a calcium channel blocker.

497
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,002
Or...

498
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:04,937
- you could tell House.
- We can't tell House.

499
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:06,807
You'll be in trouble.

500
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,817
- On the other hand, she's sick.
- She's singing.

501
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:12,731
And bleeding out of her ears,
and losing her hair.

502
00:26:12,992 --> 00:26:14,697
Aneurysm doesn't explain joint pain.

503
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,241
- Wilson's disease does.
- No kayser-fleischer rings.

504
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,200
- Anorexia.
- Now you're just desperate.

505
00:26:19,856 --> 00:26:22,538
Biliary tumor causing
pareneoplastic syndrome.

506
00:26:24,595 --> 00:26:26,289
That might actually fit.

507
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:28,729
I'll scan to confirm.

508
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:31,047
- You'd do that for me?
- You don't have time.

509
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:34,142
Which means I can ask
for 25% of your income

510
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,977
and you'll give it to me.

511
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:46,428
You going over the fence?

512
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,502
Took three visits,

513
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:52,310
but I finally convinced the contractor
that I'm Cuddy's boss.

514
00:26:52,435 --> 00:26:54,902
And all the office renovation plans
need to go through me.

515
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,164
You did do the math on this, right?

516
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:59,668
Screwing with her office means
her renovation'll take longer.

517
00:26:59,793 --> 00:27:01,659
Means she will be
in your office longer.

518
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,933
See there?

519
00:27:03,782 --> 00:27:06,457
I'm having a bidet put in
instead of a toilet.

520
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:09,301
Not in addition to.
Instead of.

521
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,502
You know what happened
to the old toilet?

522
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:15,178
She'll be with you
where you claim to not want her.

523
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:18,652
I smashed it with a sledgehammer.

524
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,509
I think in some ancient cultures

525
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:23,891
that was actually considered
a proposal of marriage.

526
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,800
Is this fun for you?

527
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,521
Analyzing everyone else's fun away?

528
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,767
Ask her out.

529
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:33,484
It'll cost the hospital a lot less.

530
00:27:38,404 --> 00:27:39,861
I brought some visitors.

531
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:41,249
Cheer you up.

532
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:44,385
It's okay.
Come on in, guys.

533
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:47,538
We're all staying on your plan.
Nobody's cheating.

534
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:49,625
That's great.

535
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,718
You're on my arm.

536
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:54,153
We found out
about your gastric bypass.

537
00:27:54,764 --> 00:27:56,130
How could you lie to us?

538
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,901
The doctors told you?

539
00:27:58,198 --> 00:28:00,856
- You're really hurting my arm.
- You're not the best you

540
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:02,493
you can be.

541
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:04,200
You're a fraud.

542
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,140
You're a self-hating fat person.

543
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,722
You're really hurting me.

544
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:09,122
Feel the burn.

545
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,185
Help!

546
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:20,938
Get off of me!

547
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:22,279
Get off of me!

548
00:28:22,404 --> 00:28:23,407
Get off of me!

549
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:32,580
Mood congruent hallucinations.

550
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,269
Means it's not guillain-barre.

551
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:36,679
Which means whatever it is,
it's now in her brain.

552
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:42,343
- Where are you going?
- Sorry. Treatment.

553
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:45,514
Does Foreman schedule
your appointments by

554
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,381
numbers on the clock or just by when
I'm in the middle of something?

555
00:28:48,506 --> 00:28:50,768
Sorry if I'm dying
at a bad time for you.

556
00:28:50,893 --> 00:28:52,188
Could be cns lymphoma.

557
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,857
So losing the 200 pounds
was just a coincidence?

558
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,540
What about a prion disease?

559
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,418
If her brain is slowly turning into
a swiss cheese,

560
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,869
there's not a lot we can do.

561
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:09,872
There are some possible treatments.

562
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:12,269
Get a brain biopsy to confirm.

563
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:14,877
You're not cutting into this
woman's brain before you test.

564
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:16,904
That is the test.

565
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,884
Not for cns lymphoma, which
is a perfectly legitimate diagnosis.

566
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:25,094
One you can test for non-invasively.

567
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,306
You're obviously not
opposed to being invasive.

568
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,033
Rule out cns lymphoma first,

569
00:29:30,254 --> 00:29:32,172
then rule out astrocytoma,

570
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:33,896
then rule out other brain tumors.

571
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,564
I hereby declare them ruled out.

572
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:39,184
Run the tests.

573
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:42,284
You can do a brain biopsy,
but only as a last resort.

574
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,307
Start running down Cuddy's
list of diseases it's not.

575
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:58,427
You're not stopping
me for medical reasons.

576
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:01,655
You're stopping me...

577
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:04,007
because you have the hots for me.

578
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:10,180
You're still here because
you have the hots for me.

579
00:30:10,526 --> 00:30:12,205
Evidenced by the fact that

580
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,975
I'm the one
who moved into your office.

581
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,335
It's the biggest office.

582
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,940
- I'm not the one that destroyed...
- Why are you dressed like that?

583
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,565
Why do you try so
hard to get my attention?

584
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,818
Are you screwing with me?

585
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,318
Are you screwing with me?

586
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,823
That depends on your answer.

587
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,872
Everybody knows this
is going somewhere.

588
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,457
I think we're supposed to kiss now.

589
00:30:42,818 --> 00:30:44,248
We already did that.

590
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,850
It seemed like the
logical next step.

591
00:30:56,258 --> 00:30:57,258
Really?

592
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,705
I'm an idiot for being surprised.

593
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,851
Can you leave these?

594
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,771
I'll keep coming,
but can you change my appointment time?

595
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:41,777
Can't.
Schedule's full.

596
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:44,747
You're stuck with her.

597
00:31:44,872 --> 00:31:46,443
Might as well get to know her.

598
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:39,028
Your head MRI was clean.
Means you don't have CNS lymphoma.

599
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:41,835
- What's next on the list?
- Other types of brain tumors.

600
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:43,828
Can we stop at the cafeteria?

601
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:45,919
I can have something brought up.
What do you want?

602
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,294
Chocolate cake.

603
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:55,261
You can't give up.
We're gonna figure this out.

604
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,309
What am I supposed to be hoping for?
That you find a brain tumor?

605
00:32:59,838 --> 00:33:01,142
What else could it be?

606
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,125
You were so hard on me about lying.

607
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,444
How about you take some of
your own advice and tell me the truth?

608
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:10,944
What's next on the list?

609
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,552
Prion disease.

610
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,909
And if that's what I got, how bad?

611
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:21,006
There are a few treatments,

612
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:22,777
but there's no guarantee.

613
00:33:25,031 --> 00:33:26,033
I'm sorry.

614
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,053
And you won't let
me have a piece of cake?

615
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:49,566
Where's Cuddy?

616
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,938
It's not cns lymphoma.

617
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:54,154
I know.

618
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:56,033
She's getting worse.

619
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:59,142
You want me to find Cuddy and
get her approval for the brain biopsy?

620
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,146
When you were philandering
with impunity,

621
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,457
how did that feel?

622
00:34:06,517 --> 00:34:08,907
Superficially, I loved it.

623
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:10,245
But...

624
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,929
deep down, I think I was miserable.

625
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:14,757
Why?
What's going on?

626
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:16,384
You weren't miserable.

627
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:22,343
You gave something away
to make a relationship work.

628
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:25,328
You rationalize
that you're getting something back.

629
00:34:26,985 --> 00:34:29,844
Okay, I'm gonna go get Cuddy's
approval for the brain biopsy.

630
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,014
Leave 'em there.

631
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,985
I'm gonna do the biopsy myself.

632
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,860
Cuddy wanted us to eliminate
seven different things.

633
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:41,807
She doesn't always
get what she wants.

634
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:44,357
Bad idea to get into a power play
with somebody who has the power.

635
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,522
You're fired.

636
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,406
Just reinforcing your point.

637
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:50,585
Whatever personal drama
you're playing out,

638
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,733
you'd be a lot smarter to...

639
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,578
thought you said she was sick.

640
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:04,821
Sick people...

641
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:07,407
don't spontaneously get better.

642
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:08,596
Yes, they do.

643
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:10,520
It's called an immune system.

644
00:35:10,848 --> 00:35:13,900
Sick people who are sick enough
to make it to me

645
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,658
don't spontaneously get better.

646
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:18,393
Not as pithy,
but yeah, technically more accurate.

647
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,700
- What's the last thing you gave her?
- I took her for an MRI looking for...

648
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,286
MRI's detect.
They don't treat.

649
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:28,248
- What did you give her after the mri?
- I didn't give her anything.

650
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,659
She got depressed
at the lack of direction.

651
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:32,919
We went to the cafeteria
for some chocolate cake.

652
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:36,173
Took her to her room,
hung a bana bag, let her rest.

653
00:35:38,488 --> 00:35:39,884
You gave her cake.

654
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,735
She asked for it.
I figured...

655
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,973
you figured you'd let me play
20 questions instead of just telling me.

656
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:56,609
Feeling crappy again?

657
00:35:57,842 --> 00:35:59,183
I brought your cure.

658
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:05,605
I'd give you an
IV of this stuff, but

659
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,121
the frosting tends to get stuck
in the little tubes.

660
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,539
Is this a joke?

661
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,721
It's not a joke.
Not a lie.

662
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:13,960
Not an attempt to
defraud in any way.

663
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,463
It's an actual

664
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,161
licensed physician
with an actual diagnosis.

665
00:36:18,956 --> 00:36:21,459
Hereditary coproporphyria.

666
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,101
Your face is genetically blessed.

667
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,396
Your body chemistry
is slightly less so.

668
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,917
Doesn't make enough of
a certain enzyme that

669
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:38,153
I can't pronounce, but it's apparently
important for your liver

670
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,537
and everything else.

671
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:42,099
Treatment is a high
carb diet rich in sugar.

672
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:44,896
When you were a porker,
you were self-medicating.

673
00:36:46,127 --> 00:36:47,393
So this is treatable.

674
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:49,481
We just have to reverse
your gastric bypass

675
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:52,000
and get you back on a high carb,
glucose-enriched diet.

676
00:36:52,353 --> 00:36:54,084
The best you you could be

677
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,722
is a lot more you.

678
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:59,349
Open the hangar.
Here comes the plane.

679
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,052
There's nothing else you can try?

680
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:03,411
No.

681
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:07,108
There's a drug that manages
the symptoms, but it's not a cure.

682
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,402
Let's try that.

683
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:15,939
You don't want to have the surgery?

684
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:20,612
Understand.

685
00:37:22,488 --> 00:37:24,453
There's not many people
who have the guts to admit

686
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,700
they'd rather be
pretty than healthy.

687
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:29,543
The income's better
and you get more action.

688
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:33,415
I'll start you on your
drug treatment right away.

689
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:40,005
I bought it.

690
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,100
I bought that it was really about trying
to make people's lives a little better.

691
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,874
You're surprised she's superficial?
You're a plastic surgeon.

692
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:48,663
- This is the human condition.
- No, she's a freak.

693
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:52,519
Every time you put someone under to bob
their nose, you were risking their life.

694
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,604
What?

695
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:56,247
No singing.

696
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:57,475
She's better.

697
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,327
No one was supposed to
let my patient leave her bed.

698
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,798
She had a respiratory arrest.

699
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:09,261
We coded her nearly 20 minutes,
but she didn't make it.

700
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:16,795
House is an unemotional child
incapable of intimacy or romance.

701
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,086
Trust me, it's done.

702
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:20,546
This is perfect.

703
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:24,609
I like the desk.

704
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:26,476
Lot of character.

705
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,972
That's not the one I ordered.

706
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,767
This is my desk from med school.

707
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:38,023
- You have it in storage or something?
- My mom did.

708
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,607
That was sweet of her to do that.

709
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,381
She didn't.

710
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:44,778
My mom has no idea
I'm redoing my office.

711
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:03,922
I lied to you the other night.

712
00:39:06,629 --> 00:39:08,604
That woman in the waiting room,

713
00:39:09,232 --> 00:39:11,388
she didn't freak me out
about my future.

714
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:16,209
She freaked me out about my past.

715
00:39:18,364 --> 00:39:19,447
Your mother.

716
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:23,599
Must've been horrible
watching her die.

717
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,360
I wanted her to die.

718
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,852
She just...

719
00:39:33,352 --> 00:39:35,249
yelled so much.

720
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,062
And for no reason.

721
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:40,585
Just screamed at me
in front of my friends.

722
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:45,787
My father tried to explain to me
that her brain was

723
00:39:45,912 --> 00:39:47,838
literally shrinking, that

724
00:39:47,963 --> 00:39:49,608
she didn't mean it.

725
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:53,223
That it was the disease,
but I didn't care.

726
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:57,348
I hated her.

727
00:40:04,023 --> 00:40:05,318
I never said good-bye.

728
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:09,755
And she died

729
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:11,374
with me hating her.

730
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,920
Did chase test for
the biliary tumor?

731
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:31,490
Said it was negative.

732
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:34,729
Said she was stable
when he left her.

733
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:37,178
Should've found more time.
We should've...

734
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:38,793
House is gonna kill us.

735
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:41,938
Slowly.

736
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:45,736
And painfully.

737
00:40:47,671 --> 00:40:49,988
You're not only idiots,
you're frauds.

738
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:52,462
Fraudulent idiots.

739
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,621
Fraudulent idiotic killers,
as it turns out.

740
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:58,607
- House, this was really my...
- your fault?

741
00:40:58,732 --> 00:41:01,108
For pretending to be me
when you're not even competent.

742
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:04,535
And your fault for not ratting him
out while the patient was still alive.

743
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:09,214
What she had was easily treatable.

744
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:12,918
She could've been fine.

745
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,470
Damn treatment's so simple.

746
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,310
Might still be possible.

747
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,566
House, she's clearly dead.

748
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,575
- She was dead.
- She wasn't dead.

749
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,843
She wasn't even sick, you moron.

750
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:40,657
Seriously, how good was she?

751
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:42,736
No formal training.
At least not in acting.

752
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:44,187
Did you see their faces?

753
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:46,548
I think we may have an
anal hygiene violation there.

754
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:48,378
So the ct.

755
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,423
That was from a patient
three years ago.

756
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:52,206
It was hard to find.

757
00:41:52,331 --> 00:41:53,794
But the hair and make-up,

758
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,346
getting chase and cameron
to play along, much easier.

759
00:41:57,486 --> 00:41:58,768
We deserved it.

760
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,768
- I'll take down the website.
- Take it down?

761
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,490
Are you kidding?
It's way too lucrative to shut it down.

762
00:42:04,615 --> 00:42:06,731
For chase, for me,

763
00:42:07,732 --> 00:42:10,777
I earn 50% for letting
you use my name.

764
00:42:12,746 --> 00:42:14,948
Go to work.
First dollars go to expenses.

765
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,862
I booked our little thespian
here for two full days.

766
00:42:17,987 --> 00:42:19,284
That's three g's I owe her.

767
00:42:22,938 --> 00:42:25,044
And you still got three hours left.

768
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:27,792
Do I?

769
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,361
