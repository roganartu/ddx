1
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,466
Hey!

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,791
Dr. Sebastian!

3
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,151
Two pallets of antibiotics
for tuberculosis.

4
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,268
We’ve got six pallets
worth of patients!

5
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:43,360
Stoia Tucker needs a math lesson.
I’m headed back tomorrow.

6
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,911
Hey! Hey.

7
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:53,383
Come on! Come on!
Let that truck though!

8
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,078
Let it though!

9
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,094
Move those boxes.
Quick, quick!  Let’s move!

10
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:06,004
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Let’s go, let’s go, hurry!

11
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:10,908
I’ve got some very special medicine here;
this is from Hershey, Pennsylvania.

12
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:14,034
One per person, one per person.

13
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:28,109
Help, help!
Dr. Sebastian, come quickly!

14
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:30,944
My son, he fell.
He fell on this rock.

15
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:33,089
We were just waiting for his friends.

16
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:38,038
[Speaking in a native language]

17
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:41,598
I got no breath sounds on the left.

18
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:43,236
Give me that.

19
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:54,191
Yeah, he’s gonna be okay.

20
00:01:55,548 --> 00:02:00,000
The fall didn’t cause him to drop a lung,
the lung caused him to fall.

21
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:03,912
TB chewed it up.
He’ll be lucky to live another year.

22
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:05,598
Now, this is Sarni.

23
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:07,842
I picked up the tab
for the back brace myself.

24
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:14,540
The funny thing is is that the brace cost
more than the medicine that would have
prevented her from needing it.

25
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,124
It’s your medicine.

26
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:22,230
All of the antibiotics that
we need are right here
in your warehouses, in your factories.

27
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:25,472
- We provide over 10,000 doses a year.
- Which is not enough.

28
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:27,740
You know we’d love to do more,
but our hands are tied.

29
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,023
New car, Jerry?

30
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:30,602
I saw it on the way in,
looks beautiful.

31
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,572
Don’t make this personal.

32
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,463
All the way from Germany, too, I know that’s a lot of red tape.

33
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:37,083
I’m not like you;
I’m not ashamed of making a living.

34
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,472
And I know you didn’t become
a chem. major for the money.

35
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:42,350
Now you want the same things
that I want, you just...

36
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,381
You have to,
you just have to push a little,

37
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,592
you have to push
a little bit harder,

38
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:50,093
harder for them.

39
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,654
Sebastian?

40
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:59,520
Call 911!

41
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:03,545
Isn’t someone here a doctor?

42
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:10,032
2x04 - TB or Not TB

43
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:35,512
Original Airdate (FOX): 1-NOV-2005

44
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:45,677
Selling subscriptions?
I heard 20 and you get a new bike.

45
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,324
Dr. Sebastian Charles collapsed
during a presentation at Stoia Tucker.

46
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:52,590
Really? Crushed under
the weight of his own ego?

47
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:55,733
Wow. Is there nobody you admire?

48
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:59,766
Well, there was this gal
I met in ‘Nam who could
blow out a candle without using her...

49
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,670
He thinks it’s TB.

50
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:04,394
Good thing he’s not the syphilis expert.

51
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,919
- He wants a second opinion.
- Second to his own.

52
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:10,399
Okay. It’s not TB.

53
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:11,858
What is it?

54
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,125
Oh, you want specifics?

55
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,895
Lemma. Big Knicks fan.

56
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:21,474
You’ve never had
an episode like this before?

57
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:23,907
No. He died last month.

58
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:26,508
Stupidly tried to share
his meds with his cousin,

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,427
and they only had enough for one.

60
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:32,449
Dr. House,
I’m Sebastian Charles.

61
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:37,065
Patients aren’t usually
part of the diagnostic process.

62
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:39,057
Well, I’m a doctor…

63
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:41,497
Listen, I know you guys
don’t make a lot of money, but...

64
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,170
I wrote your people
a check last month.

65
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:45,747
Oh, well… write us another one.

66
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:47,200
Talk to Chase, he’s rich.

67
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,240
My dad, not me.

68
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,801
Every minute 4 people die of TB.

69
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,348
Wow, how can you sleep at night?

70
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:56,118
There’s people dying in Africa
of a disease that we cured over...

71
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,646
Yeah, I know.
I saw the concert.

72
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:02,988
Seriously, let’s say you sleep six hours,
that means every night you kill...

73
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:04,859
1440 people.

74
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:07,015
I guess you gotta
get some sleep, but come on,

75
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:10,071
if you’d stayed up another 10 minutes
you could have saved 40 lives.

76
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:12,300
Do you send notes
to the families in the morning?

77
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,109
That’s gonna take at least 10 minutes
so that’s another 40 dead, another 40 notes….

78
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:19,754
Why don’t you go wrack yourself
with guilt in your own room?

79
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:22,966
No, thanks, I’ll stay.
I’d like to hear the differential.

80
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:27,336
Dr. Cameron, tell the doctor
why it’s not a good idea
for the patient to be here.

81
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:29,692
He’s an immunologist
and a TB expert.

82
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,743
That’ll be very useful
if we need somebody to say the words,

83
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:35,354
- “I think it’s TB.”
- [Chuckles]

84
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,483
[Sniffs]
What is that?

85
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,211
Oh that. I’m sorry,
that’s my body powder.

86
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,666
It’s the only thing I’ve found
that works in the Sahara.

87
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:45,184
I, I’m kinda used to it,
I don’t even notice it.

88
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,674
Who thinks it smells like
an elephant dung smoothie?

89
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:49,899
- It smells okay to me.
- [Laughs.]

90
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:52,281
That is exactly why the patient
shouldn’t be in the room.

91
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,620
If you can’t tell a man that
his cologne makes you want to puke,

92
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,429
how are you going to tell him
that he’s an idiot?

93
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:58,062
He’s not an idiot.

94
00:05:58,402 --> 00:06:01,129
Sure, you say that now,
while he’s in the room.

95
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:03,011
Sebastian:
Look, I don’t have time for this.

96
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:04,605
- It’s TB.
- Nope.

97
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:06,753
The symptoms are too varied.

98
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:10,164
Well, if you haven’t seen 10,000 cases
I’d agree that’s what you’d think.

99
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,461
Told you he’s an idiot.

100
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:13,050
You said you wanted
a second opinion.

101
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:16,251
No, actually. My backers
wanted a second opinion.

102
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,263
Yeah, doesn’t look good if you drop dead
while wearing your shoes sponsor’s logo.

103
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:25,657
It’s TB, and I’m not dying.
I’m gonna want you to plan a PPD and
induce a sputum to confirm the TB.

104
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:28,936
Imaging studies’ll
determine the progress, and

105
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:33,597
I think we should probably
take a CT scan of my lungs just
so that nobody second-guesses us?

106
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,234
Wouldn’t want that.

107
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:37,410
[Cell rings.]

108
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,312
[On phone] Hello?
No, I’m feeling much better.

109
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:47,548
Well, what you can do is
you can get your board to approve
the increased med shipments that...

110
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:55,000
Aha. No, no, no, no, don’t try.
No, no, don’t do your best.

111
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:57,768
Just get it done, okay?

112
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:02,891
That’s Stoia Tucker, and they’re
the nice pharmaceutical company.

113
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:05,254
I’m sorry, but
it’s against hospital regs.

114
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,133
Oh, I need the phone.
[Beeper goes off]

115
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,472
Why don’t we focus on
getting you better right now?

116
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,646
[Beeper goes off]
What are you gonna do,
throw me out?

117
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,040
No, just the phone.

118
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,393
Sorry, we’ve got an emergency.
[Beeper goes off.]

119
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:18,852
There’s a phone in your room.

120
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,183
Yeah, I figured that there would be.

121
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:24,423
Right, I just thought,

122
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:28,309
it’s not like the hospitals that
you might used to in Africa.

123
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:31,796
I don’t know
what the facilities were like…

124
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:33,511
Thank you.

125
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:35,814
You’re welcome.

126
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,802
And thanks for that check.

127
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,351
[Beeper beeps again]
I should go.

128
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:49,853
The nameless poor have a face,
and it’s a pompous white man.

129
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:53,907
Yeah, what a jerk,
saving all those lives like that.

130
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,962
What’s the emergency?

131
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,605
I can’t remember
how to do Walk the Dog.

132
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,117
The guy’s sick,
he may be dying.

133
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:03,825
We’ve forgotten all about
doing a differential diagnosis.

134
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,653
You just sent us off to test him for...

135
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,191
I had to get him out of there.

136
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,277
Now we can all sit around
and call him an idiot.

137
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:10,351
Who wants to go first?

138
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:13,708
He’s right!
Tuberculosis could present
in hundreds of different ways!

139
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:16,561
Well, by that logic, everyone
in the hospital should be treated.

140
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:19,593
Not everyone in the hospital’s been
exposed to it for the last 20 years.

141
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:21,597
TB takes years to kill you.

142
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:24,801
2 weeks ago he was perfectly healthy,
now he’s got a white board full of symptoms.

143
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:26,846
What about something metabolic?

144
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,503
Welcome aboard
the Good Ship Asskisser.

145
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,965
Nice day for a sail.
Pucker up, me hearties.

146
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:36,280
It’s not metabolic.
Kidney, liver and thyroid are
all normal. No diabetes.

147
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:37,644
What about his heart?

148
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,652
Obviously big as all outdoors.

149
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:44,110
Abnormal heart rhythm.
White form showed P-R variability.

150
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,729
It’s subtle, but it’s there.

151
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,886
You think it’s his heart?
Sick sinus syndrome?

152
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:51,832
Loose throttle.
Sometimes beats too fast,
sometimes too slow.

153
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:53,124
Causing him to pass out.

154
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:54,823
It would account for the episode.

155
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,534
I’ll put him on telemetry,
do a stress test and
an echocardiogram.

156
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,879
Treat him like every
other hospital patient.

157
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,941
I want to see that
pious, body powered toosh
hanging out of his gown.

158
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,609
Could you give me
a hand with this thing?

159
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,622
I don’t recall asking for
a stress test or an echocardiogram.

160
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:20,577
What are you gonna do, walk out?

161
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:23,937
Corporate sponsors
aren’t going to like that.

162
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,146
I need your forearm.

163
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,773
What’s House thinking?

164
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,066
Sick sinus syndrome.

165
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:35,955
Well, that’s a lot
more serious than TB.

166
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:37,785
Is that a PPD?

167
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,949
If it changes color
in the next 48 hours...

168
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:44,236
Yeah, uh, if House doesn’t think it’s TB
why would he have you test for that?

169
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:47,601
Just covering all his bases, I guess.

170
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:53,563
Uh huh. He doesn’t seem like
a guy who, who does that.

171
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:58,275
We have you scheduled
for a 10:30 echo.

172
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:02,406
Good for you.
[Chuckles]

173
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:07,400
Every minute that
we refuse to love one another,

174
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,383
another puppy cries another tear.

175
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:13,255
You’re just mad that he’s closer
to a Nobel Prize than you are.

176
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,271
And yet I’ve nailed
more Swedish babes.
Crazy, crazy world.

177
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:20,855
It’s not just a trip
to Stockholm, you know.

178
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,782
It comes with a cash prize.

179
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:24,302
Seriously?

180
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,981
No wonder everyone’s
going after that peace thing.
[Elevator dings]

181
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,901
He cures thousands of people
every year, you cure, what? 30?

182
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:35,804
McDonald’s makes
a better hamburger than your mother
because they make more?

183
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:42,004
Oh, I see! So you hate him
because the lives he saves aren’t
as good as the lives you save.

184
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:45,915
Yup, that’s the reason.
Nobel invented dynamite.

185
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:48,453
I won’t accept his blood money.

186
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,875
The top of my head’s killing me.

187
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:58,705
Hmmm. We spent a week
doing ‘top of head’ in Anatomy.

188
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,723
I know just where it is.

189
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:05,280
Ow! That is not the top of my head!

190
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,645
Eh, close enough for clinic.
Your sinuses are clogged.

191
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:13,354
Judging by the scratches
on your hands,
I’m guessing a new cat.

192
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,172
It was my mother’s.
She’s dead.

193
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,234
You keep a dead cat?

194
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,987
No. My mother’s dead.

195
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:24,918
Oh. Poor cat.
You’re allergic.

196
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:27,859
We can control it with
antihistamine, one pill a day.

197
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,136
Pills?

198
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:31,618
You don’t like to swallow.

199
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:35,459
Not surprised. Forget the pills.
I’ll give you a nasal spray.

200
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:39,837
Steroids?
Is there something else
you can give me?

201
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:44,856
Well, if you lived by the river,
I’ve got a bag.

202
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:48,179
Hey, stress test was normal.

203
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,659
But his EKG was not normal.

204
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:52,270
Echo’s normal.

205
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:55,657
Two for you, one for me.
We need a tie-breaker.

206
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,977
Echo and stress test
are more reliable.

207
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,484
Tilt-table test.

208
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:00,886
Never works.

209
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,757
Bet you a week’s
clinic duty it does.

210
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:06,707
Hah hah, you’re on.

211
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,690
You like this guy?

212
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:15,669
You always tell us our opinion
of the patient is irrelevant.

213
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,491
Medically, it’s irrelevant.

214
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:19,191
That says something about you.

215
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,406
You figure that
anybody that gives a crap about
people in Africa must be full of it?

216
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:29,696
Yes. There’s an evolutionary
imperative why we give a crap
about our family and friends.

217
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:33,419
And there’s an evolutionary
imperative why we don’t give
a crap about anybody else.

218
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:36,340
If we loved all people
indiscriminately,
we couldn’t function.

219
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,461
Hmmm.
So, the great humanitarian’s
as selfish as the rest of us.

220
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,438
Just not as honest about it.

221
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:46,331
You also always tell us
motives are irrelevant.

222
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:50,670
<i>Dr. Charles,
your heart’s handling the changes
in orientation just fine.</i>

223
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,289
<i>No pauses on your EKG.</i>

224
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:57,144
And House drives up for
the lay-up and oh, rejected!

225
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:59,042
What does this knobby thing do?

226
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,928
I’m within protocol range,
you’re not going to get a different result.

227
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,236
The way I figure it is,
if this could show you problems at 6,

228
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:08,966
imagine what could happen
if you crank it to 10.

229
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:10,488
House, is that you?

230
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:11,504
Does it go to 11?

231
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,045
Would you stop? You lost.
I’m scheduled for clinic duty
Thursday and Friday.

232
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:16,983
All right, I’m beginning
to feel nauseous.

233
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:19,441
Would you turn the damn thing off
before you break it?

234
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:24,222
Okay, I’m getting dizzy,
I can’t see, I’m gonna pass out.

235
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:26,252
I win.

236
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:28,323
At those speeds
astronauts throw up.

237
00:13:28,413 --> 00:13:30,572
I’m not talking
about the nausea.

238
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:31,845
Foreman:
The test revealed a problem.

239
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,911
Yeah? House is insane?
What he just did...

240
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,853
Abusive and unprofessional.

241
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,508
If he hadn’t done it,
we wouldn’t have seen the problem.

242
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:42,591
You’ve got
an abnormal P-R interval.

243
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,124
It could be dangerous,

244
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:47,878
possibly fatal, particularly
if you’re in Africa away
from advanced medicine.

245
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,055
I’m gonna need a pacemaker?

246
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:53,151
You’re scheduled
for surgery this afternoon.

247
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:01,745
You’ll be able to maintain
your pacemaker from anywhere,

248
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,097
you just need to get yourself
to a phone line every few months.

249
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:07,073
Better yet, you could
join me at one of my clinics.

250
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:08,421
I’m kind of spoiled.

251
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:11,187
Well, we’ll get you a hut
with a view. You like sand?

252
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,632
I meant medically.

253
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:15,853
- No PET scans, no MRIs…
- This is ridiculous.

254
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,973
- Dr. Charles, wait...
- I know, I know,
hospital regulations. Darling...

255
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:20,908
...have a seat. Come on.

256
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:24,613
You’re smart, you’ll adapt…
we going up or down?

257
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,562
- Basement.
- All right.

258
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:31,591
You might even find that
without the technological crutches
you become a better diagnostician.

259
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:33,290
My heart can handle this, right?

260
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,947
So far just carnival rides
have set you off.

261
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,623
When you meet these people
it changes you.

262
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:43,530
We should talk
about it over dinner.

263
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:47,450
Are you asking me
to Africa or on a date?

264
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,284
Oh, I can ask you
halfway around the world,

265
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,990
I can’t ask you to
a restaurant a block away?

266
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,719
Well, one’s a job,
and the other’s…

267
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,070
Yeah, hospital regs,
you can’t date patients, right,

268
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,743
I wouldn’t want to risk
your precious objectivity.

269
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:03,973
You haven’t answered
either question, by the way.

270
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:07,339
You don’t think
objectivity’s important?

271
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:11,403
I think doctors like House
cling to objectivity like a
three-year-old to a blanket;

272
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:16,988
don’t get too worked up,
stay calm, stay cool and
maintain that correct perspective.

273
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,925
The only flaw in their argument is
when you have millions of people dying

274
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:24,760
the correct perspective is to be
yelling at the top of your lungs.

275
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:31,299
- Sorry, my head is killing me.
- Here, sit on the step.

276
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:39,137
So, you gonna go out
with me or not?

277
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,093
Your heart rate’s normal.

278
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,407
Yeah, of course it is,
it’s one flight of stairs.

279
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:45,125
I’m gonna be fine.

280
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,465
My hand’s a little...

281
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:58,949
Call a code!
Second floor stairwell!

282
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,519
You were wrong.

283
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:10,317
Hey, I have feelings.
I’m trying my best.
Isn’t that enough for you?

284
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,898
- The abnormal EKG was real...
- It’s not sick sinus syndrome.

285
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,980
Well, thank God we found out
before we put the pacemaker in.

286
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,590
And thank God
you dragged him into a stairwell
to get his heart racing.

287
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:22,944
We were taking the stairs,
they keep them in the stairwell.

288
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,015
The guy’s a selfish jerk,
why would you...

289
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,173
Why would you say
he’s selfish?

290
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,765
Because he’s been
talking to Foreman.

291
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,958
No I haven’t,
I’m just giving my opinion.

292
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:32,357
This kind of altruism
doesn’t just naturally...
[Phone rings]

293
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:33,213
Excellent briefing.

294
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,147
Hey, the guy’s still sick.
Can we talk about that?

295
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:38,425
The headaches point to
a neurological problem.
Acoustic neuroma.

296
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:41,105
Brian tumor causes dizziness,
loss of consciousness,

297
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,324
messes with breathing patterns,
heart rhythms...

298
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:44,839
Get an MRI.

299
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:49,469
Hello? Oh, I’m sorry,
I’ll be right down.

300
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,079
No problem, I’ll do
an extra hour to make up.

301
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:58,844
I’m late for my clinic duty.
Here, go be me for a couple hours.

302
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:06,470
Explosive diarrhea, fever…
it’s probably the flu.

303
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:10,960
Wow, you’re good.
You a Harvard boy?

304
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:13,272
You’re not Hale, Oliver?

305
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:16,769
No. Carter, Cecelia.

306
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:18,380
They put you in the
wrong room, Cecelia.

307
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:19,944
Mrs. Carter.

308
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:25,722
Sorry. I’ll just be a few minutes,
don’t take these in order
and everything falls apart.

309
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,628
I have cancer.

310
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:30,296
I felt a lump.

311
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,756
- I’ll go get a nurse.
- Yeah, see you in an hour or two.

312
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,755
Lie flat.

313
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:44,907
Lift your left arm up
and under your head?

314
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:50,980
Right there?

315
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:54,226
Yeah, I felt it this morning.

316
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,948
Oh, my cousin had the same thing.

317
00:17:58,103 --> 00:18:00,867
It’s nothing.
We should check it again
on your next cycle, but

318
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,374
you really don’t have
anything to worry about.

319
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,636
That’s what they told Donna.
She was dead in six months.

320
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:10,707
Listen, the edges are smooth,
it has mobility, it has all
the earmarks of a benign...

321
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,611
Why should I believe you?

322
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,337
Because you’re trying
to rush me out of here?

323
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:18,439
The risks of a false positive
on a biopsy outweigh...

324
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:22,256
Either you do the biopsy
or I talk to your superior.

325
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:25,965
Which is it...Dr. House?

326
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,956
I’ll arrange the biopsy.

327
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,210
Thanks.

328
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:42,080
He asked me out.

329
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:44,201
I’m shocked.

330
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:49,310
I’m shocked when
patients don’t ask you out.

331
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,842
He also asked me
to come to Africa.

332
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:56,914
Boy, he moves fast.

333
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,456
I think the two questions had
two different objectives.

334
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:00,857
Well, do you like him?

335
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:05,498
Good looking single guy,
genius doctor, cares about the world…

336
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,123
I take it you said no.

337
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,742
You think
I’m that hung up on rules and...

338
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,098
He’s not House.
There’s nothing there.

339
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,126
Yeah, there is.

340
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:27,351
- Did I ask you to plant a PPD?
- It was positive, he’s got TB!

341
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:31,752
Well, of course he’s got TB!
The guy’s been in the jungle for 20 years!

342
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:36,418
If he tested positive
for pink-eye would you think
that was his big problem?

343
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,002
I did a test, it was positive,
why is that a problem?

344
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:43,183
Because now he’s got
the big red target on his arm,
the stubborn jerk thinks he’s right!

345
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:44,514
He won’t let us
do any more tests.

346
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,800
Well, maybe he’s not
the only stubborn jerk.

347
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,331
I did an LP2: low glucose and
he has an increased sed rate.

348
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,343
- Everything screams tuberculosis!
- Not everything!

349
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:58,493
If any of the symptoms
are caused by the TB
it would throw off our diagnosis.

350
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:06,727
You’re right.
Gotta treat the TB.

351
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:10,207
Who knows,
maybe he’ll just get better.

352
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:12,305
You’d like that, wouldn’t you?

353
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:24,245
So it’s TB, but not TB?

354
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:25,917
I’m complicated.

355
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:29,219
The guy does know tuberculosis.
If he says it can manifest itself...

356
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,895
He’s not even a real doctor, he’s a human telethon.

357
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,619
Is that your problem with him?

358
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:36,082
You see hypocrites every day,
why is this guy so special?

359
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,873
You think I have a
hypocritical attitude to hypocrisy?

360
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:42,372
The problem is
there are 26 letters in the alphabet
and he only uses two of them.

361
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:44,641
He treats thousands of patients
with one diagnosis.

362
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:46,806
He knows the answer going in.
It’s cheating.

363
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:50,770
So it’s all because he’s
one of them useless specialists?

364
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:55,735
Oh, did I hurt the big time
oncologist’s itty bitty feelings?

365
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:58,552
You’re a big help to patients
who actually have cancer.

366
00:20:58,662 --> 00:21:00,241
Other times you’re just annoying.

367
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,016
You’ve outdone yourself.

368
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:05,291
I’ll say. My salad’s
covering a free t-bone steak.

369
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:07,482
Cecelia Carter,
remember her?

370
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:10,104
Last week they said it was
“Mystery Stew”, they owe me.

371
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:13,679
She was just in my office crying
because of the way you treated her.

372
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,294
That doesn’t sound like you!

373
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:17,040
Then it probably wasn’t.

374
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,162
I get that you like
to shock people.

375
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:23,482
Stun them
out of complacency,
out of stupidity.

376
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:27,580
But this woman thought
she had cancer, she had
a lump in her breast!

377
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:29,023
What were you
trying to accomplish?

378
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,650
Let me ask you something:
if this were another doctor,

379
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,845
if this patient were
complaining about, let’s say,

380
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,378
I don’t know, Foreman,

381
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,691
you’d just dismiss this
as the paranoid bitching of another
paranoid bitch and file it under ‘P’ for...

382
00:21:41,774 --> 00:21:42,787
Paranoid?

383
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:44,477
Am not.

384
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:47,331
- You’re right.
- Good.

385
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,678
Apologize to her before
the end of business today.

386
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,726
- What did you do to Ceci?
- I have no idea.

387
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,757
Just a salad today,
big breakfast.

388
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:00,082
Hey.

389
00:22:03,837 --> 00:22:05,646
Levofloxacin?

390
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,437
You have a resistant strain of TB.

391
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,292
Wow, you just walk
right in with these.

392
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:12,956
That’s what we doctors do.

393
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:16,246
We write down
the name of some medicine
and someone gives it to us.

394
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,547
You know, there’s parts of
the world where you get knifed
walking around with this.

395
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:24,426
I mean, regular stuff’s
bad enough, but

396
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:28,177
treatment for the resistant strain?
[Whistles]

397
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:32,682
I could get $6
a tablet for that one.

398
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:34,947
And I’d take it
for two years.

399
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:38,905
Streptomycin,
now that’s two grand…

400
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:43,840
ten grand, cure one person.

401
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:54,195
I had a patient in Jani once.

402
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:59,605
It was a mother, had...
had three little boys.

403
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:01,863
She had resistant TB,

404
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:07,871
she couldn’t afford these.
She couldn’t afford bread.

405
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,832
We gave her
the regular stuff, but...

406
00:23:14,008 --> 00:23:15,738
no surprise she died.

407
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:17,592
I’m sorry.

408
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:29,842
I’m not taking these pills.

409
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:34,090
Because she couldn’t get them
you’re not going to take them?

410
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:35,159
That’s insane!

411
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:36,775
Why, because I’m
better than her?

412
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:41,680
Because letting her die was wrong
but letting you die is just as wrong.

413
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,368
Well, maybe I won’t die.

414
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:48,211
Maybe somebody’ll pay
a little more attention to my story.

415
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:55,869
He figures the pharmaceuticals need
something big to force them into action.

416
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:59,502
[The phone rings]
This’ll get a lot more media play
than a thousand African villagers dying.

417
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:00,997
So he won’t take the pills.

418
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:02,109
Newsweek’s calling you!

419
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:03,807
And he won’t agree
to any more tests.

420
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:05,052
He has his diagnosis.

421
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:06,596
See what happens
when you don’t listen to me?

422
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:10,489
- Maybe millions of lives get saved...
- Yeah, that’s my point.

423
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:15,289
Increased heart rate,
night sweats, loss of consciousness,
besides rough sex,

424
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:16,862
what do they all have in common?

425
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:18,567
- T...
- It’s not TB!

426
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,644
- His autonomic nervous system?
- We know that it’s not a brain tumor.

427
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:23,505
So what else could be
eating his nerves?

428
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:27,987
Fabry’s, autonomic disregulation syndrome,
shy-drager syndrome, it doesn’t matter.

429
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:29,685
He won’t let us test him.

430
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:32,972
[Phone rings again]

431
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:38,756
[On phone] In my opinion,
Dr. Sebastian Charles is an idiot.

432
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:40,660
Yeah, you can quote me.

433
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:43,532
C-u-d-d-y.

434
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:45,543
[Chase and Foreman laugh to themselves.]

435
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,629
Sebastian is refusing
life-saving treatment.

436
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,265
He’s refusing TB treatment.
You don’t think he has TB,
ergo you should care less.

437
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,670
He won’t let me test him.

438
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:57,177
And what do you
want me to do about it?

439
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:58,616
Hold him down.

440
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:01,610
Have you apologized
to Cecelia Carter yet?

441
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,184
Trust me, she doesn’t
want to hear it from me.

442
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,796
Look, the guy is killing himself,

443
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:08,384
am I the only one who
realizes this is a bad thing?

444
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:12,880
If he was a Christian Scientist
refusing meds we’d have 18 attorneys...

445
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:16,886
You’re putting on make-up.

446
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:19,888
That’s not a good sign
for my side, is it?

447
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:23,339
Sebastian has called
a press conference for 3.

448
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:26,751
He’s asked me to be there
to confirm the diagnosis
on the prognosis.

449
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:29,513
You are as big a
media whore as he is.

450
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:33,593
Of course I am.
It couldn’t possibly be
that I think he’s right

451
00:25:33,685 --> 00:25:36,022
and I’d like to be a
small part of what he’s doing.

452
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:39,918
Oh, whores can like the sex.
Doesn’t mean they’re not whores.

453
00:25:40,197 --> 00:25:41,857
And with that eyeshadow…

454
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,363
I am totally screwed, aren’t I?

455
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:45,742
Totally.

456
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:51,100
How’re you feeling?

457
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,296
A little weak.

458
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:53,953
You’re having a good day.

459
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:58,317
The symptoms will quickly focus
more and more on your lungs,

460
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:00,623
you’ll find it difficult to talk
and eventually breathe at all.

461
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:02,639
I think I know what
I have to look forward to.

462
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,734
I know.

463
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:07,173
I just came to ask
if you’d be willing to
accept any treatment.

464
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:09,161
Naw, if you’re trying
to scare me into any...

465
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,721
No. Palliative treatment.

466
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:16,730
Narcotics, Fentanyl patch,
morphine drip, whatever it takes.

467
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:20,486
We can make your last days
fairly comfortable.

468
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:25,206
And if you have another
good day, maybe dinner.

469
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:26,397
Hmm.

470
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:29,579
Thank you.

471
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:42,169
You want third-world treatment?

472
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:43,804
You got it.

473
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,145
Boy, is it hot here in Jani!

474
00:26:46,258 --> 00:26:48,794
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

475
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:51,461
Putting everything
on the floor of the hut.

476
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,367
Uh oh, wicked magic box
with the moving pictures!

477
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:55,348
You think he’s a hypocrite?

478
00:26:55,435 --> 00:27:00,433
Hypocrite? No, everyone in Africa’s
got cell phones or running water.

479
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,312
Hah, this thing just will not flush.

480
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:08,605
Do you really think
that if you come in here
and make it a little hot,

481
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:13,852
make it smell a little, that
I’m just going to fold and abandon
everything that matters to me?

482
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:17,896
Lousy sanitation over there, too.

483
00:27:17,972 --> 00:27:20,664
You are not the same as them,
your life is not the same.

484
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:23,374
And you are cheapening
everything they’re going through
by pretending you are.

485
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:24,943
I am the same,
I’m not special.

486
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:30,103
You can’t demand to be treated
like any third-world sick person
and call a press conference!

487
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:34,250
They treat me special!
That doesn’t mean I am!

488
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:39,032
Now what kind of selfish jerk
wouldn’t take advantage of that fact?

489
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:55,564
It’s all preventable.

490
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:58,190
Stoia Tucker makes
medications right here,

491
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,821
in New Jersey.
They have warehouses
full of the stuff;

492
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:02,686
there’s more than
enough to go around.

493
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:06,674
So if I can get them,
why can’t Lemma?

494
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,661
Why can’t Quesmo?

495
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:11,025
And why can’t Sarni?

496
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,225
[Snaps]

497
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:15,325
Another person just died.

498
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:17,474
Where is your outrage?

499
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:18,017
[Snaps]

500
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:20,972
[On TV] No, I have no intention
of martyring myself,
I’m just putting myself...

501
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:24,878
[Keeps snapping]
Sure, they’re dying,
but it’s got a great beat.

502
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:27,290
Must be hot as hell
under those lights.

503
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:28,160
Yup.

504
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:31,457
Hey, why the page? He okay?

505
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:33,299
He’s in a coma.

506
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,986
I need you to apologize
to Ceci, Cecily...

507
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:39,232
Mrs. Carter? For what?

508
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:42,348
- For whatever I did.
- You didn’t do anything.

509
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:44,415
That has been
my position all along.

510
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:48,666
[On TV] X-rays are negative,
so he’s not contagious at this point,
his condition’s currently stable...

511
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:52,837
D’you notice how all the
self-sacrificing women in history...

512
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:57,615
Joan of Arc, Mother Theresa,
can’t think of any others...

513
00:28:57,711 --> 00:29:03,319
they all die alone.
The men on the other hand
get so much fuzz it’s crazy.

514
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,939
It’s an unfair world.

515
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:07,453
House, she was scared
and unreasonable.

516
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:12,122
Insulting a woman with breast cancer...
that’s a move best left to the pros.

517
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:14,515
Frankly, you don’t have the chops.

518
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:16,077
I didn’t insult her!

519
00:29:16,165 --> 00:29:19,233
I did the unnecessary biopsy,
like she wanted.

520
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,158
It was negative,
like I knew it would be.

521
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:23,301
What did you do,
call ‘em perky?

522
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:26,994
You are years away
from mad skills like that.

523
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:29,060
I need you to apologize.

524
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,800
You know, Cuddy’s only doing this
because she thinks it’s you.

525
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:34,854
Welcome to the world.

526
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,280
Everyone’s different,
everyone gets treated different.

527
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,439
You try fighting that,
you end up dying of TB.

528
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:43,774
What are you doing?

529
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,964
Testing the patient’s
autonomic nervous system.

530
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:48,628
Of course.

531
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:51,522
His internal heating and
ventilation should be off,

532
00:29:51,614 --> 00:29:52,995
shouldn’t be able to sweat.

533
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:55,158
That’s why he’s got that
awful body powder.

534
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,374
Take it away, crank up the heat,
stick him under the lights,

535
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,459
can’t cool himself.
He should be turning bright red.

536
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:03,894
The picture’s fine.

537
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,372
I’m asking Stoia Tucker
to save these lives, millions of lives.

538
00:30:17,578 --> 00:30:19,270
Including my own.

539
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:22,492
Dr. House,
I would appreciate it
if you left us alone.

540
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:23,742
Get that out of my face.

541
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:25,534
Cuddy:
What are you trying
to prove, House?

542
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:28,294
Dr. House,
I would appreciate it
if you left the room.

543
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:29,771
He’s sweating like a pig.

544
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:32,516
It’s a hundred degrees
in here, House, because
you turned up the thermostat.

545
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:35,354
Did they hear me?
The media, did they listen?

546
00:30:35,445 --> 00:30:36,372
He’s disoriented.

547
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:37,732
They, they have to hear me.

548
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:39,059
His arteries are clamping down.

549
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:40,904
[A monitor starts beeping]
I want everybody out of here, now!

550

Get the crash cart,
he’s having a cardiac arrest!

551
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:44,608
[More beeping.]

552
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:46,140
Cuddy:
Get them out!

553
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:49,104
Everyone, I want everyone
out of here now!

554
00:30:53,864 --> 00:30:54,783
Clear.

555
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:02,429
Come on, Sebastian. Clear!

556
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,996
I’ve got sinus rhythm.

557
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:17,974
That is not TV!

558
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,286
Compelling television.

559
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,174
Do whatever tests you want.

560
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:26,350
I want to treat you for TB.

561
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:30,460
Dr. Cameron found low sugar
in your cerebrospinal fluid.

562
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:32,360
It’s a classic finding of TB.

563
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:34,812
And now you think
TB’s the problem?

564
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:39,030
Nah. TB caused
cardiac arrest on a hot day,

565
00:31:39,122 --> 00:31:42,071
your work in Africa would be
even more futile than it already is.

566
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:43,813
Can you get to your point, please?

567
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:45,705
That white board in my office,

568
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:47,566
we’re up to about a dozen symptoms now.

569
00:31:47,632 --> 00:31:53,052
Cardiac arrest, clearly not TB.
CSF sugar clearly is TB.

570
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,200
The rest of them
could go either way.

571
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:58,342
Unless we know which ones
are which I can’t diagnose you.

572
00:32:02,576 --> 00:32:06,719
I’ll take any other tests or treatments
you might want to prescribe.

573
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:12,116
So you’re
not special, but TB is.

574
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:15,306
People die of TB
because we let them,
it’s our choice.

575
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:18,697
People die of malaria
because we let them,
they die of dysentery...

576
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:20,776
Nah, TB’s my disease.

577
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:22,699
You own a disease?

578
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:26,267
Well, I’m sorry
I missed the IPO
on dengue fever.

579
00:32:26,392 --> 00:32:28,437
Look, I know
I have a way about me.

580
00:32:28,588 --> 00:32:32,853
I know I piss a lot of people off,
and a whole lot more I just annoy.

581
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:37,752
But you’re the first person that
I’ve ever met who I think is
actually annoyed by what I do.

582
00:32:37,847 --> 00:32:41,775
Do you think
I’m not saving any lives,
or is that a bad thing?

583
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,536
Right now, I’m just
trying to save your life.

584
00:32:44,677 --> 00:32:46,750
Or do you just have
a problem with hope?

585
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:53,213
You know,
the difference between our jobs
is not numbers or styles.

586
00:32:53,328 --> 00:32:55,337
It’s that I know
I’m gonna fail.

587
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:59,110
Even if I save a million people
there’s gonna be another million.

588
00:32:59,923 --> 00:33:02,189
You couldn’t handle that.

589
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:04,911
I think you resent anyone who can.

590
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:08,095
Can’t we just agree that
you’re incredibly annoying?

591
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:13,276
Take the pills or I let you die,
do an autopsy,
call my own press conference,

592
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,479
and make sure the world knows
that you didn’t die of TB.

593
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,223
Corporate sponsors
will be disappointed, but
they’ll find another disease.

594
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:21,973
Why would you do that?

595
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:24,825
Because I’m just a
mean son of a bitch.

596
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:39,029
So we still have to explain
P-R variability, syncope, headaches,

597
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:42,615
and...low sugar?

598
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:45,791
- That was classic TB.
- Apparently not.

599
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,660
Cameron: You’ve rerun the test?
Chase: Yeah.

600
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,291
This is good!

601
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:52,111
Good? This is bizarre.

602
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,755
Bizarre is good!

603
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:57,274
Common has hundreds
of explanations.
Bizarre has hardly any.

604
00:34:57,365 --> 00:34:59,594
What else could
cause low CSF sugar?

605
00:34:59,684 --> 00:35:02,383
Uh-uh. I get to
ask the questions.

606
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:05,923
I’ve found you look
a lot smarter asking the questions
than dumbly not answering.

607
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:08,739
- High insulin levels in his blood.
- They’d have to be very high.

608
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,427
Chase: Okay, very high
insulin levels in his blood.

609
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:13,354
How could he get
high insulin levels?

610
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:16,161
We’ve checked
daily blood sugars, all normal!

611
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:19,076
See how smart she looks?
Cause she asked the question.

612
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:22,242
And it’s not glucagonoma
because he has no rash.

613
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:25,481
It’s not self-induced
because he’s not an idiot,

614
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:29,681
and it’s not a tumor
because the CT and the MRI
were both negative.

615
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:32,264
Which just leaves tumor.

616
00:35:36,376 --> 00:35:37,106
Why do you do this?

617
00:35:37,193 --> 00:35:38,806
Why do you ignore
what I say like I’m not even...

618
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:41,299
Small tumor.
Really, really tiny.

619
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,638
So small we can’t see it.
Nesidioblastoma.

620
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:47,902
An abnormal growth of
the insulin-secreting glands
of his pancreas?

621
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:49,951
It only intermittently
secretes insulin.

622
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,886
It responds to stress.
Like if, oh, I don’t know,

Except, if it’s so small
we can’t see it,

to prove it’s there?

“She asked, looking clever.”

628
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,055
We just start hacking away
at his pancreas until he gets better?

629
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:11,669
How do you prove
something exists
when you can’t see it?

630

Does God exist?
Does the wind blow?

631
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:15,791

[Elevator dings]
Look for effects.

Dr. House!

Dr. House has an emergency.

We’re going to inject calcium
into your pancreas.

649
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:06,412
The beta cells will release insulin.

650
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,219
If there are
too many beta cells
because of a tumor,

651
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,095
your blood sugar will
drop precipitously.

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,062
45.

661
00:38:05,412 --> 00:38:07,252
I think my arm’s shaking.

662
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:10,438
I’m gonna start him
on a glucose drip.
He’s gonna seize

663
00:38:10,528 --> 00:38:11,641
Not yet.

664
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,911
Foreman:
He’s continuing to drop.

665
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,177
House:
Not fast enough.

666
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,475
[Monitor beeps]
He’s seizing.

667
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:27,225
We’ve got to reverse this.

668
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:33,753
Cameron:
He’s at 40, 38, 35...

669
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:36,821
[Monitor beeps more]

670
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:44,198
Push an amp of D-50,
you want to kill the guy?

671
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:55,838
We’re back to 40.

672
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:59,941
Congratulations,
you have a tumor.

673
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:01,666
[Elevator dings]

674
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,748
Are you gonna
go out with him?

675
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:10,284
Is that any of your business?

676
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:11,674
Nope.

677
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,532
I don’t think so.

678
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,165
Two days ago
you were holding his hand.
What’s changed?

679
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:22,509
He practically lives in Africa,
there’s no future.

680
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:26,354
On the other hand,
maybe there’s too much
of a future now.

681
00:39:26,511 --> 00:39:30,431
You weren’t attracted to him
because he was prepared
to die for a cause,

682
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:33,601
you were attracted to him
because he was actually doing it.

683
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:35,867
Right. It’s that simple.

684
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:36,803
That was simple?

685
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,481
I put a label on them
and go from there.

686
00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:41,502
Everybody does it.

687
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:43,725
We are who people think we are.

688
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:46,072
People think he’s a great doctor
so they give him stuff.

689
00:39:46,161 --> 00:39:47,045
He is a great doctor.

690
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:49,130
The reality is irrelevant.

691
00:39:54,464 --> 00:39:56,306
I’ll prove it.

692
00:39:56,577 --> 00:40:00,535
People who know me
see me as an ass,
treat me as an ass.

693
00:40:00,628 --> 00:40:04,747
People who don’t know me
see a cripple, treat me as a cripple.

694
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:09,211
What kind of selfish jerk wouldn’t
take advantage of that fact?

695
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:18,179
Ow!

696
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:23,802
Oh, my goodness,
are you okay?

697
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:26,074
Yeah.

698
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,705
I am so sorry.
It was completely my fault.

699
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,534
It’s nothing, I’m fine.

700
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:35,441
Well, I’m very relieved,
I feel terrible.

701
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,865
Don’t worry about it,
I’m fine.

702
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:40,172
- You sure?
- Mmm. - Okay.

703
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:53,601
How’s everything?

704
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:56,399
I’m gonna go.
My foot’s killing me.

705
00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:00,784
- Oh, what did you do?
- It was nothing, it was all my fault.

706
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:08,508
[On phone]
Yeah, listen Fugawi, relax.
I’m gonna be back on Tuesday.

707
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:12,560
Tell Sarni I’m gonna
bring her a new brace. All right.

708
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:14,382
Just in case.

709
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:15,971
You get ‘em?

710
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:18,851
Six month supply.
Should fix you right up.

711
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:20,511
I see you when
you come back for a refill?

712
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:22,298
Yeah, I’ll see you
in two months.

713
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:24,096
You’re gonna give them away?

714
00:41:24,634 --> 00:41:28,177
Well, you know
how these things happen,
you leave a bag in the airplane,

715
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:30,431
drop some pills
down the drain...

716
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:35,485
I have an idea.
You could bring me
the refill in Africa.

717
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,547
I don’t think so.

718
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:41,528
You actually like
working for House,
you find this satisfying?

since I was born? #</i>

721

723
00:42:16,068 --> 00:42:19,951
Thank you, thank you,
I appreciate that.
I appreciate the support.

724
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:23,103
It’s not about the kids
dying every 8 seconds,

725
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:25,466
it’s about the media stroking.

726
00:42:25,556 --> 00:42:28,344
Adulation and pats on the head.

727
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,328
That’s your problem
with him, isn’t it?

728
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:34,289
Look at him,
he loves it. Eats it up.

729
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,648
Yeah, the man actually
enjoys what he does.

730
00:42:44,266 --> 00:42:46,437
Listen, I saved his life.

731
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:50,466
That means
I get credit for every life
he saves from here on out.

732
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,880
I’ll make sure
Stockholm knows.
