00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:24,786
<i>(marina)
mr. Randall?</i>

2
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:27,322
They're here.

3
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:46,441
(pete)
$52 million includes
over $6 million

4
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:48,843
Already issued pursuant
to the over-allotment option.

5
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:50,078
When can we close?

6
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:51,980
It would be subject
to regulatory approval

7
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:54,048
<i>In both toronto and--</i>

8
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:57,452
I didn't say, "how," oliver.
I said, "when."

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,620
What?

10
00:00:58,687 --> 00:00:59,988
You sure this
is a direction

11
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:01,489
You want to go,
roy?

12
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:03,024
This would move us
from energy service into--

13
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:05,326
You don't think oil's
going up?

14
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:06,895
Of course it's gonna
go up.

15
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:08,196
The question is when.

16
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:09,764
The question is always when,
and if we wait

17
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:11,733
Until the deal makes sense
to everyone else,

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,135
We're gonna be waiting
in line behind everyone else.

19
00:01:14,203 --> 00:01:15,904
All I'm saying is--

20
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:19,407
The same cover-your-ass crap
you always say.

21
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:20,341
We're gonna have
to wrap this up.

22
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:21,442
I got to go.

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,144
<i>Where are you going?
Upstairs.</i>

24
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:24,846
Get the regulators on it.

25
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:25,980
<i>I want to close by
the end of the month.
Come on, roy.</i>

26
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:28,349
There are ten other items
on the agenda.

27
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:29,717
Which will have
to wait until next week.

28
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:30,985
You can't drag us all out
of the office,

29
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:33,388
Get halfway through,
and then just kick us out.

30
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:34,656
Yeah, I can.

31
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:04,552
<i>(dr. Johnson)
the antibiotic treatment
had no effect.</i>

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,955
Both the fever and the pain
are getting worse,

33
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:09,557
Which means it's not
clostridium difficile.

34
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,527
But you said that was the only
diagnosis that made sense.

35
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:14,495
It was.

36
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:16,898
We need to get him
to a hospital.

37
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:20,868
<i>(jack)
dad?</i>

38
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:24,305
I don't want to go.

39
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:27,709
I know, buddy.

40
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,811
<i>But we may need to.</i>

41
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:31,245
Am I gonna die?

42
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:36,884
No, of course not.

43
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:38,553
How do you know?

44
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:43,625
Well, I just do.

45
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,093
And I'm always right,
aren't I?

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,997
Yeah.

House 6x04 Instant Karma

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,300
I want house.

50
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:28,603
I understand,
but I told you

51
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:29,971
Dr. House isn't available.

52
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,372
<i>Dr.--
Call him.</i>

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,941
Tell him I'll have
a private jet

54
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,643
Pick him up from
whatever island--

55
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:36,978
<i>He isn't on vacation.</i>

56
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:38,780
Dr. Foreman's one
of our best doctors.

57
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,214
Is house in jail?

58
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:41,683
No.

59
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,452
Foreman is currently working
with two of house's

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,920
<i>Most veteran associates.
Rehab?</i>

61
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:47,922
No.

62
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,692
Mr. Randall, your son will be
in good hands.

63
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,163
My son...Has already been
in good hands,

64
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,998
And he's still dying.

65
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,667
<i>I'm through dealing
with good.</i>

66
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:03,504
I want the best and everyone
I've asked says that's house.

67
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:06,874
<i>So unless he's dead,
comatose,</i>

68
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:11,546
Or insane, I want him
treating my son today.

69
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:20,855
You could have said no
in good conscience.

70
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:22,290
<i>(cuddy)
the kid'll still
be foreman's patient,</i>

71
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:24,726
But his dad wants you
making the decisions.

72
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:26,794
Then he's not
my patient.

73
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:28,429
You want to give me none
of the responsibility

74
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:29,831
And all of the liability?

75
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:33,034
Which means I get--

76
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:34,902
Oh, cool.

77
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,905
Don't let him
do anything crazy.

78
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:40,341
When is he getting
his license back

79
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,909
So we can stop
playing this game?

80
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:45,480
Maybe never.
This game is fun.

81
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:47,682
You also need to prepare
president dibala's case

82
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,252
For this week's morbidity
and mortality conference.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,288
Ohh, unfortunately I'm overdue
a mani-pedi appointment.

84
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:55,289
<i>Not you.</i>

85
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:56,557
Foreman's department.

86
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,959
Oh, right.

87
00:04:58,026 --> 00:04:59,360
Well, he's got all the time
in the world.

88
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:01,829
We made the wrong call.
He died.

89
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:03,397
There's nothing
to present.

90
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:06,033
It obviously garnered
a lot of curiosity.

91
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,435
And we don't have more
important things to do

92
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:09,837
Than satisfy everyone's
idle curiosity?

93
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,873
It's not idle.

94
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,876
The question of how we deal
with two possible diagnoses

95
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,410
Whose treatments
are contraindicated

96
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,280
Is worth discussing.

97
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,884
Abdominal pain increasing
in severity and frequency,

98
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,385
<i>Fever, dehydration,</i>

99
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:26,487
Diarrhea, weight loss.

100
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:28,089
Mom died from kidney
failure caused

101
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:30,091
By type one diabetes,
which has been ruled out.

102
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,359
<i>(house)
17 doctors.</i>

103
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:33,294
<i>Everything's been
ruled out.</i>

104
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:35,563
Which means we have
to re-rule out.

105
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:37,031
Get a new history
and physical.

106
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:42,403
Unless that's crazy,
boss.

107
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:43,671
(cameron)
you been out of the country

108
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:45,673
Or on any
recent camping trips?

109
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:47,275
No camping.

110
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:49,110
But we were in montreal
back in January.

111
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:51,913
We went to see the nhl all-star
game for my birthday.

112
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,015
Awesome.

113
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:55,716
Where's dr. House?

114
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:57,451
In his office.

115
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,887
He's really more of
a decider than a doer.

116
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:01,789
<i>He's decided we should
start over.</i>

117
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:05,059
Never know what previous doctors
may have missed.

118
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:10,231
Like this.

119
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:12,133
Does that hurt more
when I push there?

120
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:13,801
Not really.

121
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,770
What is it?

122
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:18,472
I'm not sure.

123
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,575
Just keep it clean,
simple.

124
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:22,310
We did a test that
called into question

125
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:24,645
Our initial diagnosis,
so we changed our mind.

126
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:26,747
And if they ask
how the test was done?

127
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,550
Why would they do that?
It's a routine lab test.

128
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:32,653
Routine lab tests don't involve
blood you stole

129
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:33,921
From a corpse
to trick me

130
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:35,423
Into giving the guy
the wrong treatment.

131
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,091
Yes, and if you brought
that up,

132
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,360
It'd certainly make for a
lively debate about the morality

133
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:41,128
<i>Of murdering murderers.</i>

134
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:42,830
But since you burned the only
evidence of that--

135
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:44,732
To cover for you,
not me.

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,300
<i>You're protected.</i>

137
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:47,935
The decision was a coin flip.

138
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:51,372
There was no right
or wrong answer.

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,141
The body's underground,
8,000 miles away.

140
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,077
Nobody can prove anything.

141
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:58,112
That room will be filled,
not because of the coin flip,

142
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,947
Not because of the patient,

143
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:02,149
But because house's
department screwed up.

144
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:04,819
They're gonna be like sharks
in a chum-filled swimming pool

145
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:06,520
And there's no way
I'm jumping in

146
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:09,390
Unless I'm
in a steel cage.

147
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,958
So what do you want?

148
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:13,961
I want to know you
have everything covered.

149
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:17,164
<i>(house)
got what covered?</i>

150
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,467
We're just reviewing
the dibala case.

151
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:21,502
Making sure we didn't
miss anything.

152
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,371
We didn't.

153
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:26,874
Except of course the thing
that killed him.

154
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:28,743
<i>(cameron)
he's constipated.</i>

155
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,211
Physical revealed a mass
in his abdomen,

156
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,412
So I repeated the x-ray.

157
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,014
Old one was clean.

158
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:34,849
New one shows that his colon's
almost completely impacted.

159
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:37,919
Obstruction would explain
the pain.

160
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,987
Think they just
screwed up the old x-ray?

161
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:41,889
Nope.

162
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,894
Hirschsprung's?

163
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:49,196
It's a congenital disorder
of the nerves in the colon.

164
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:51,132
Very rare in a child
your son's age.

165
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,800
Most doctors would never
think of it.

166
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:54,035
And you came up with this?

167
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:55,870
It's house's idea.

168
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:57,505
We need a barium enema
and biopsy to confirm.

169
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:59,040
Let me guess.

170
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:01,275
It tastes really bad,

171
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:05,446
But it's gonna make me feel
a lot better.

172
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:08,316
Actually, you're not
gonna taste it.

173
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:12,920
<i>[fanfarlo's fire escape]</i>

174
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:23,230
You should try searching for
"misty may digs for gold."

175
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:24,865
Make sure you put it
in quotes.

176
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,501
I'm making travel plans.

177
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,971
<i>Just need to get away.</i>

178
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:31,906
Have some time to myself.

179
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:34,875
You getting the hint?

180
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:38,346
So that's it?

181
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:41,215
You're done with your little
experiment with foreman?

182
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,918
It wasn't an experiment.
It was a relationship.

183
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:47,788
You may want to look
into the difference.

184
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:51,359
I'm glad you're better,
house.

185
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:53,394
I actually liked
working for you.

186
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:55,396
But I'm not coming back.

187
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:57,131
Good.

188
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,899
<i>'cause if you came back,</i>

189
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,168
Foreman would try
and save the relationship

190
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:03,037
And he'd give up
being the boss.

191
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:06,841
Are you here to try to save
my relationship with foreman?

192
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:08,542
<i>God no.</i>

193
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,745
<i>Trying to save my
relationship with foreman.</i>

194
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:13,781
Right now I'm kobe
playing the game I love

195
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:16,317
However the hell I want.

196
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:18,786
Phil jackson has to listen
to everyone else bitch about it.

197
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:20,721
Enjoy cabo.

198
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,660
I'm going to thailand.

199
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:29,263
Really?

200
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:30,631
Interesting.

201
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:32,867
Good-bye, house.

202
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,770
Good-bye, thirteen.

203
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:41,342
(cameron)
last week, yesterday, today.

204
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,110
I can't believe it.

205
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:45,312
He's pain-free for
the first time in months.

206
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,981
He's even hungry.

207
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,582
I'm starving.

208
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,850
Still waiting
for the biopsy results,

209
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:50,918
But obviously it's
a good sign.

210
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:52,520
You're gonna want
to take it slow.

211
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:55,122
Don't try to regain all
the lost weight in one meal.

212
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,657
[chuckles]

213
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,659
What's wrong?

214
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:03,030
Abdomen feels normal,
but it looks bigger.

215
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:05,366
Jack, are you feeling--
jack?

216
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,968
Hey, jack, you okay?

217
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:10,071
Right eye's fixed.

218
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:11,405
Lateral rectus palsy.

219
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:13,007
[electronic beeping]

220
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:14,341
<i>He's seizing.</i>

221
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:16,010
Need five milligrams
of diazepam.

222
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:17,611
What's happening?

223
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,246
Put that on his head and
turn off the lights.

224
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:21,082
I need to see
his optic disk.

225
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:22,883
Heart rate's elevated.
Come on, come on, hold his head.

226
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:24,118
I'm trying.
Wait! Where's house?

227
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:25,820
Mr. Randall,
we need you to step back.

228
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:27,021
<i>(foreman)
his optic disk is swollen.</i>

229
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:28,389
He's got intracranial
hypertension.

230
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:30,291
Furosemide.
20 milligrams iv.

231
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:31,892
We could intubate him--

232
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,661
Need five more milligrams
of diazepam.

233
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:35,529
Dc the monitors.

234
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:37,198
Push 500 milligrams phenytoin.

235
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:38,766
We can't push that much.

236
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,234
We got to remove the pressure
or his brain could herniate.

237
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:43,938
Oh, my god.

238
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:46,941
50 milligrams
of phenytoin.

239
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,610
Page chase.
Tell him to meet us in the o.R.

240
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:50,978
We need your consent.

241
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,646
What's happening to him?

242
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:53,814
Pressure in his skull's
too high.

243
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:55,216
If we don't reduce it,

244
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,484
<i>It could irrevocably
damage his brain.</i>

245
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,285
But he was just talking.
He was smiling.

246
00:10:58,353 --> 00:10:59,386
We need to drill
burr holes.

247
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:01,355
Drill into his head?

248
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:02,623
Phenytoin's not working.
Paralyze him.

249
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:04,158
Three milligrams pancuronium.

250
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:06,827
Then intubate
and hyperventilate.

251
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:08,129
Where's house?

252
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:11,198
House isn't here.
Do we have your consent?

253
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:12,933
<i>Do we have your consent?</i>

254
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:14,101
Ready?

255
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:15,136
One, two, three.

256
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:20,307
Three milligrams pancuronium.

257
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:27,681
Look at the monitors.
He's still seizing.

258
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:31,652
We need to do this now.

259
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,587
Go.

260
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:49,470
Electrical seizure
activity's stopped.

261
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,742
Intracranial pressure's
declining.

262
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,510
<i>Come on.
Keep going.</i>

263
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:58,779
Pressure's down to eight.

264
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,749
I'll tell the dad.

265
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:04,285
What happened?

266
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:06,754
I have no idea.

267
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:09,756
He hasn't had
any more seizures,

268
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:11,857
And cytological examination
of the subdural fluid

269
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:13,392
Showed no abnormalities.

270
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,696
Don't usually see brain damage
after a rectal biopsy.

271
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,331
He was fine after
the procedure.

272
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,999
No headaches.
No mental status change.

273
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:23,102
Wasn't anything we did.

274
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:24,670
It's not just his brain.

275
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:26,071
He's continuing to build up
fluid in his abdominal cavity

276
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,373
As well as the dura.

277
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,641
We've inserted shunts
to drain it.

278
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,643
Got to be some sort
of systemic infection.

279
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,512
Not after spending the last week
getting pumped

280
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,280
Full of iv antibiotics.

281
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:38,751
Notice anything odd about the
shape of the fluid collection?

282
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:41,587
Oh, god, it's...

283
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:44,056
The virgin mary.

284
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:46,358
The edge should be tapered,

285
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:47,860
<i>Lens shaped.</i>

286
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:54,433
Unless...

287
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,668
The dural layer was already
separated from the brain

288
00:12:56,736 --> 00:13:00,372
When the fluid started
to build up.

289
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,410
Get a dural biopsy
to confirm brain cancer.

290
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:05,944
Nice catch.

291
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:12,351
Bangkok.
Flight 799.

292
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:14,286
Wow.
Bangkok.

293
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:15,754
That sounds awesome.

294
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:16,755
How long?

295
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:18,090
Not sure yet.

296
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:20,292
Luckily I have
a friend

297
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,197
Who's staying at my place
taking care of my dog.

298
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:28,333
<i>He's really big,
so he needs a lot of exercise.</i>

299
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:31,637
Remy hadley.
H-a-d-l-e-y.

300
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:33,672
What, you think I'm gonna
rob the place?

301
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,507
No, of course not.

302
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:37,943
In case you haven't noticed,
I have a job.

303
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:39,678
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know you.

304
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:41,280
You're either honest
or dishonest.

305
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:42,681
I figured
the safer choice is--

306
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:44,383
Is to treat a stranger
like an ass.

307
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:47,186
Nice way to live your life...
Bitch.

308
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:49,054
I said I'm sorry.

309
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,722
Oh, hello.

310
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,724
<i>I was wondering if there were
any business class seats</i>

311
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:55,093
Open that I could use
my miles to upgrade to.

312
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:59,264
I don't know you,
but I assumed I could trust you.

313
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:00,966
Welcomed you in my car.

314
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:03,302
Okay, you're a saint.

315
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:04,603
That's impossible.

316
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:06,205
I confirmed my reservation
last night.

317
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:09,575
<i>So rebook it.</i>

318
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:13,745
Well, obviously it was a mistake
on your end, not mine.

319
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:15,514
<i>No, I'm on my way
to the airport</i>

320
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:19,985
Right now.

321
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:23,489
They didn't
believe you, huh?

322
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:30,262
Brain cancer?

323
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,997
We should know for sure
by the morning.

324
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:33,866
[sighs]

325
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:36,502
Our luck just keeps getting
worse, huh?

326
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:38,537
Treatment options are getting
better every day.

327
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:41,473
There's no visible mass,
so even if the biopsy

328
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,674
Comes back positive,
we've caught it early.

329
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:45,410
Oh, so you're telling me
this is good news?

330
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:47,513
I'm saying we will do
whatever we can.

331
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,181
Right.

332
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:51,783
[cell phone rings]

333
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:52,851
Sorry.

334
00:14:57,457 --> 00:14:58,757
I got to go.

335
00:14:58,825 --> 00:14:59,992
Foreman needs more help
with the m and m prep.

336
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,194
Okay, I'll come up and help

337
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:03,362
After I finish
the biopsy.

338
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:04,930
We can handle it.

339
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:05,998
I'll see you
at home later.

340
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:07,165
If you're here,
I might as well be.

341
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,468
Go home.
Get some rest.

342
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:12,037
'cause I'm gonna be waking you
up as soon as I get home.

343
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:21,246
Stay out of my life.

344
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:23,749
Okay.

345
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:25,584
I know you canceled
my reservation.

346
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:27,185
You obviously
saw me log in

347
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:28,554
When you were spying on me
in the coffee shop.

348
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,389
I was talking to you.

349
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:32,558
I was spying on the milf
in the running shorts.

350
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,892
I'm not coming back
on the team.

351
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,060
I don't want you back
on the team.

352
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:38,497
I cannot work for, with,
or around foreman.

353
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:41,466
Which is why I don't want you
back on the team.

354
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:43,135
Now that you're out
of the picture,

355
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:44,970
He's better than ever,
which is gonna make me

356
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:46,838
Less miserable than ever,
which is why neither of us

357
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:49,107
Gives a damn how, when,
or on what island

358
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:50,776
In the bahamas you want
to get from it all.

359
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:51,910
The bahamas?

360
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:53,712
[sighs]
costa rica?

361
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,614
I told you thailand.

362
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:57,950
I assumed you were lying,

363
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:00,886
Because it would have been
idiotic of you to tell me truth.

364
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:04,623
Yet another reason
I have no use for you.

365
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:09,161
<i>(foreman)
we've got a problem.</i>

366
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:11,597
When cameron sent
dibala's blood to the lab,

367
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:14,366
She specifically asked for the
anticentromere antibodies test.

368
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,234
So?

369
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:17,369
The printout
they sent you included

370
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:19,271
Just the anticentromere
antibodies,

371
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:21,406
But the lab also did
a full blood panel.

372
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:23,375
So, I'm not an idiot.

373
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,544
I obviously made sure the
cadaver I got the sample from

374
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:26,878
Had the same blood type.

375
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:28,981
You apparently didn't check
his cholesterol.

376
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:32,317
How far off?

377
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:33,652
20%.

378
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:52,459
(chase)
dibala didn't die
of high cholesterol.

379
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:55,195
Why would anyone even bother
to compare the two reports?

380
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:56,363
The same reason I did.

381
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:57,364
Because they're looking
for anything

382
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:58,632
We might have screwed up.

383
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,434
We could claim
the blood analyzer broke.

384
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:01,835
We can't.

385
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:03,403
Cameron documented that
it was perfectly calibrated

386
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:04,638
When she did the test.

387
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:06,173
So the numbers are off,
it's weird.

388
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:07,507
Who cares?

389
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:08,709
If it comes up,
just act surprised

390
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:10,410
Like it's some
irrelevant curiosity.

391
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:12,379
I can't do this.

392
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,949
I can't go in there
and stack lie upon lie.

393
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:19,586
You've got to figure out
a way to explain this.

394
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:20,721
Hey.
Hey.

395
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:21,955
Missed you this morning.

396
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,490
Yeah, sorry.

397
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:25,592
I needed to get in early.
I didn't want to wake you.

398
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,827
I thought you did want
to wake me.

399
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:27,761
At least that's
what you said last night.

400
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,729
<i>I'm out of here.
No, no.</i>

401
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:29,897
I have the biopsy results.

402
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:31,498
It's not cancer.

403
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,006
How can so much be wrong
with nothing being wrong?

404
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:41,508
Since when has cancer been
considered nothing?

405
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:42,976
I just said
it's not cancer.

406
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:44,344
The cell morphologies
were all normal.

407
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:46,980
And so are the most recent
ct scans.

408
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,716
On the other hand,
andenocarcinoma of the stomach

409
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:52,185
Would cause pain,
constipation,

410
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:53,987
<i>Nutritional deficiencies.</i>

411
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:55,422
That could cause seizures.

412
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,791
And wouldn't show on a ct.

413
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:00,227
You're right about the cancer,

414
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:03,463
Just wrong about the place.

415
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:06,667
Continue to say nothing
if you agree.

416
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:09,937
Go scope him.

417
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,104
<i>Get another set of biopsies.</i>

418
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:20,414
I'd get canceling
her ticket

419
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:22,182
If you then showed up

420
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,451
With two more
to somewhere better.

421
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,953
What are you
talking about?

422
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,688
Or showed up at all.

423
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,923
But how does just
ruining her plans

424
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:32,459
Get her to agree
to yours?

425
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,428
You talking about thirteen?

426
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:36,430
Where's she going?

427
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:38,465
Well, nowhere this week,
thanks to you.

428
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:39,533
I didn't stop her.

429
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,468
I'm not gonna stop her.

430
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:46,740
I've already done
all I could.

431
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:49,710
Now all I can do
is move on.

432
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:53,680
I think...

433
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:55,115
I actually believe you.

434
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:56,984
If you're telling
the truth,

435
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,853
You're even more
rational than I--

436
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:03,223
Well, not more.

437
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:07,027
Then again,
more sane.

438
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:08,829
You're gonna
be a good boss, boss.

439
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:13,200
(chase)
I told you there's
nothing wrong.

440
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,235
There's obviously
something wrong

441
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:17,270
And I'm not even saying we need
to talk about it right now.

442
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:19,373
I just don't see
why you have to deny it.

443
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,208
I'm not.

444
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:23,744
Now you're denying
you're denying.

445
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:25,779
No, I'm denying that there's
anything to deny.

446
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:27,147
Robert, you can't do this.

447
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:28,415
You can't hide things
from me.

448
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:36,289
There's a problem with
the dibala m and m.

449
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:38,225
The hdl numbers on one
of his early blood panels

450
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,993
Don't match
a later panel.

451
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:42,162
That's weird.

452
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,798
Yeah.

453
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:50,971
It's no big deal.

454
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,573
Cholesterol didn't have
anything to do with his death,

455
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:55,909
But, you know,
after being let go from mercy

456
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,478
And then that thing
with thirteen's drug trial,

457
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,113
Foreman's paranoid about about
people questioning the way

458
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:01,081
He handled the case.

459
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,582
That's ridiculous.

460
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,850
If anything, foreman should be
feeling secure.

461
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:05,185
He's the one who had
the right diagnosis.

462
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:06,453
We're the ones who
talked him out of it.

463
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:07,854
I know.

464
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,756
Don't tell him
I told you.

465
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:11,391
He doesn't want to show
any signs of weakness,

466
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:12,626
Especially now that house
is claiming

467
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:14,161
He wants him
to stay in charge.

468
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:16,797
All right.

469
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:18,165
So it's still cancer?

470
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:19,533
It's just somewhere else?

471
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,867
That's what we're
looking for,

472
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,769
But it would explain
all the symptoms

473
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:24,805
<i>And all the normal test
and imaging studies.</i>

474
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:27,808
<i>(chase)
got biopsies of the mucosa
and the submucosa.</i>

475
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,609
Moving towards
the pylorus.

476
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:31,411
It's my fault.

477
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:34,481
Adenocarcinomas
aren't caused by diet

478
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:38,418
Or environmental
factors.

479
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,987
I inherited a $10 million
pipeline business

480
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:42,856
When I was 24.

481
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:46,460
By the time I was 30,
it was worth over a billion.

482
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:48,428
Since then,
I have been involved

483
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:51,298
In over 50 deals
that make that first one

484
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:54,434
Look like a loser.

485
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:56,903
Everything I do,
everything I touch

486
00:20:56,971 --> 00:21:00,440
Turns to gold...

487
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:07,080
Except my family.

488
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:08,582
First, my wife.

489
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:12,853
And now...My son.

490
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:19,626
This is my fault.

491
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,228
It's karma.

492
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:23,830
That's obviously not true.

493
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:28,435
[electronic beeping]

494
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:30,670
He's seizing again.
Get the scope out.

495
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:32,139
<i>Five milligrams diazepam.</i>

496
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:34,174
How's the icp?

497
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:35,876
It's...Eight.

498
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:37,244
<i>But the shunt's
open and clear.</i>

499
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:39,513
This isn't
intracranial pressure.

500
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,747
Then what the hell is it?

501
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:50,949
<i>(chase)
seizures stopped, but he hasn't
regained consciousness.</i>

502
00:21:51,016 --> 00:21:52,384
<i>No sign of any masses</i>

503
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:54,386
In his stomach
or esophageal lining

504
00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:57,155
And he's still accumulating
subdural and peritoneal fluid.

505
00:21:57,223 --> 00:22:00,525
And every time we look to see
where it's coming from,

506
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:01,860
He starts seizing.

507
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:03,428
You think we're
setting this off?

508
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:04,597
I think something is.

509
00:22:04,664 --> 00:22:05,965
One of his stomach biopsies
shows an arteriole

510
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:07,867
Partially occluded.

511
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:09,602
<i>(cameron)
but with no abnormality
in the other layers</i>

512
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:11,904
And no evidence of a cellular
inflammatory reaction.

513
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:13,739
It's definitely not cancer.

514
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:15,307
Then it has to be some sort
of infection.

515
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,476
We already ruled out
infection.

516
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,311
Only because he was treated
for it and got worse.

517
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,880
Seems like a sound reason.

518
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:24,048
Unless it's
a drug-resistant strain.

519
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:25,317
Drug-resistant strain of what?

520
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:27,419
<i>Bacterial cultures,</i>

521
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:29,053
Viral serologies,
a.N.A. And a.N.C.A.

522
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:30,155
Were all negative.

523
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:30,890
Everything's negative.

524
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:32,158
<i>We obviously missed something.</i>

525
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,026
Maybe the seizures aren't
a new symptom.

526
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:35,828
<i>They're an old one.</i>

527
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,762
No doctor noticed
a thrashing kid?

528
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,931
Abdominal epilepsy.

529
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,699
The seizures would just
look like pain

530
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,001
<i>Until it spread
to his motor cortex.</i>

531
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:43,369
It wouldn't explain
the fevers.

532
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:45,304
Protein malnutrition
can cause fevers

533
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:47,206
And nothing causes
malnutrition

534
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:49,208
<i>Like excruciating
stomach pain that gets worse</i>

535
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:52,111
Every time you eat.

536
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:55,514
I'd be a lot more certain
if it was my idea,

537
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,316
But it's the best we got.

538
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:59,418
Start him on gabapentin.

539
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:01,153
Hook him up to
an intracranial eeg

540
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:03,689
For continuous monitoring.

541
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,100
I gave him statins.

542
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:16,635
What?

543
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:17,937
If they ask about
the cholesterol,

544
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:19,171
Just say I prescribed
a statin

545
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,439
And forgot to put it
in the chart.

546
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:21,774
You want to solve a problem
in the records

547
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:23,943
By creating another problem
in the records?

548
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,244
It's not a problem
with the records.

549
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:26,879
It's a problem
with my record keeping.

550
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,914
There's no way anyone
can prove me wrong.

551
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:31,584
How'd you get access
to the statins?

552
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:33,018
You gonna get someone
in the pharmacy

553
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:35,521
To confess to yet another
record-keeping problem?

554
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,990
I saw an open cart.
Just took it.

555
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:39,992
Why would you
steal a drug

556
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,293
You could just
as easily ask for?

557
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:44,897
'cause I'm trying
to get you off the hook.

558
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,066
A story that raises more
questions than it answers

559
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,635
Only puts the hook deeper
down my throat.

560
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:51,937
It's all right.
I'll handle it.

561
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:53,339
How?

562
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:55,674
By telling the truth.

563
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:57,142
The truth is I don't
have the time,

564
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,210
I'm not in the mood,
and I don't see the point.

565
00:23:58,278 --> 00:23:59,979
You don't want
to do the m and m

566
00:24:00,046 --> 00:24:02,047
Because you're not
in the mood?

567
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:03,516
This kid is dying
and I've got house

568
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,584
Trying to push all his
responsibilities onto me.

569
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,952
They're not
his responsibilities.

570
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,554
They're yours.

571
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:09,755
You're the one who wanted
to be in charge.

572
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,656
I wanted
to be in charge,

573
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:11,790
Not a figurehead.

574
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:14,026
Then do the m and m.
It's all yours.

575
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:15,895
You want me to get flogged?
For what?

576
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,496
So you can have
an academic debate

577
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:19,665
About a diagnostic dilemma
no one's ever gonna face again?

578
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,169
What the hell's
going on here?

579
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:26,405
I just don't want
to do the m and m.

580
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:33,846
Did it work?
Not even close.

581
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:51,030
Everything okay?

582
00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:53,832
Just waiting for whatever
is about to go wrong.

583
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,468
Thirteen called.

584
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,403
She have a theory
that makes more sense

585
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,305
Than abdominal epilepsy?

586
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,040
She said someone hacked
into her email account

587
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:04,076
And canceled
an airline reservation.

588
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:05,377
I'm guessing foreman.

589
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:07,746
Really?

590
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:09,281
You're accusing foreman,
not me?

591
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:12,151
Cool.

592
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:14,653
You really want foreman to stay
in charge of the team?

593
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,989
Makes sense.

594
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,725
He loves power,
and I love puzzles.

595
00:25:19,793 --> 00:25:22,161
You love power and puzzles.

596
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:25,264
True.

597
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:27,766
When I had them both.

598
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:34,540
It wasn't foreman.

599
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:36,175
How do you know?

600
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:39,745
He said he's moved on.

601
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:41,347
<i>And you believe him?</i>

602
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,282
I believe
that he believes it.

603
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,186
[pager beeps]

604
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,924
Looks like it's time for me
to get off the bench.

605
00:25:58,698 --> 00:26:01,567
What's up?

606
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:03,435
Are you dr. House?

607
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:05,104
I understand you're
a big fan.

608
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:08,540
I'll have my guy send over
a signed glossy.

609
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,576
Continuous eeg shows
no interictal spikes.

610
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:12,211
It's not abdominal epilepsy.

611
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:14,013
You paged me to tell me
what it's not?

612
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,014
I paged you
to show you this.

613
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,520
That I did not expect.

614
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:23,422
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

615
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,657
Darn it.

616
00:26:24,724 --> 00:26:27,493
I knew I should have
stayed outside.

617
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,794
<i>Fantasy's always much better
than the reality.</i>

618
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:30,062
You think this is a joke?

619
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,297
<i>That's my son,
he's dying,</i>

620
00:26:32,365 --> 00:26:35,234
And not one of you seem
to have the slightest clue hwy.

621
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:37,169
I know.

622
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:38,904
That's why it's
so interesting.

623
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:44,074
Fever, stomach pain,
seizures,

624
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:45,843
Peritoneal and subdural
fluid collection

625
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:48,012
And now spots.

626
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,813
Could be an allergic reaction
to one of his meds.

627
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:51,248
That suddenly developed
eight hours

628
00:26:51,316 --> 00:26:52,783
After he started the meds?

629
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:54,952
If it's not cancer infection,
it has to be autoimmune.

630
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,687
<i>Systemic lupus complicated</i>

631
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:59,323
By a cns vasculitis
would explain the rash, fever,

632
00:26:59,391 --> 00:27:00,658
<i>Ascites--</i>

633
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:02,192
Cns vasculitis would cause
a stiff neck

634
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,961
Along with a headache.

635
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:07,264
And would've showed up
on the dural biopsy.

636
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:08,832
What about polyarteritis
nodosa?

637
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,367
It can occur in kids.

638
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:12,803
Except you can't have arteritis
without inflammation.

639
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:14,738
Okay, you come up
with something better.

640
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:19,143
Go on.

641
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,512
There was some inflammation
in the skin biopsy,

642
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,415
Plus he's got elevated
diastolic pressure.

643
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:26,817
It's barely elevated,
which you'd expect

644
00:27:26,885 --> 00:27:28,586
Given the number of procedures
he's undergone.

645
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:30,854
Well, barely is more
than not barely.

646
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:37,394
Not my decision.

647
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:39,964
But if it was,
I'd say start him on prednisone

648
00:27:40,031 --> 00:27:41,799
And get a testicular biopsy.

649
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:43,233
If he's gonna have
any real inflammation,

650
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:44,635
It'll be down there.

651
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,637
<i>Cameron and I will do it.
Why?</i>

652
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,005
It was chase's idea.

653
00:27:48,073 --> 00:27:49,673
<i>Kid's father
is not gonna be happy</i>

654
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:51,208
<i>About a fourth set
of biopsies,</i>

655
00:27:51,276 --> 00:27:52,910
And you've got
a better rapport.

656
00:27:52,978 --> 00:27:55,379
What's really
going on here?

657
00:27:55,447 --> 00:27:57,648
You need chase to help you
over-prep for the m and m?

658
00:27:57,716 --> 00:28:00,250
Yes.

659
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:02,686
Then say so.
Don't be a child.

660
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:08,125
Is it on his penis?

661
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:09,259
Kid's rash?

662
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:10,995
Yeah, why?

663
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:14,898
Means it's most likely affecting
the small blood vessels.

664
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:18,769
That's why we didn't see any
inflammation on the biopsies.

665
00:28:18,837 --> 00:28:21,305
It's not polyarteritis.

666
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:23,040
It's degos disease.

667
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:31,448
I'll do it.

668
00:28:44,295 --> 00:28:48,032
Your son has degos disease.

669
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:50,434
Causes microblood vessels

670
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:53,637
<i>In the brain, skin,
gi tract</i>

671
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:56,040
<i>To break down,
clot off.</i>

672
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:59,276
It sometimes manifests
early on

673
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:02,279
With atrophic papules
on the penis.

674
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:04,748
In your son's case,
we don't know why,

675
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:07,384
But they came much later.

676
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:10,587
What's the treatment?

677
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:15,125
There isn't one.

678
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:17,261
It's incurable.

679
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:26,736
You're wrong.

680
00:29:26,804 --> 00:29:28,471
You've already been wrong
a bunch of times.

681
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:31,741
We've rechecked
the biopsies.

682
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:33,276
It's definitely degos.

683
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:38,782
I'm sorry.

684
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:40,684
I wish there was something
we could do.

685
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:50,594
How long?

686
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:54,097
<i>Not much longer.</i>

687
00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:55,932
What does that mean?

688
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,069
Day at the most.

689
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:44,714
All right, great.

690
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:46,283
We need to talk.

691
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,019
Unless it's life or death,
it's gonna have to wait.

692
00:30:49,086 --> 00:30:50,120
It's about dibala.

693
00:30:50,187 --> 00:30:51,721
Well, let me rephrase.

694
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,989
Unless it's a current life--

695
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:55,792
Foreman can't present
the case at the m and m.

696
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,694
I know you guys are busy,
but he's just

697
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:59,262
Gonna have to suck it up
and make the time.

698
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,864
It's not the time.

699
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:01,898
Then what is it?

700
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:05,502
The anticontromere
antibodies test.

701
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,504
The test that caused us
to change the treatment

702
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:10,740
From blastomycosis
to scleroderma...

703
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:12,509
It wasn't--

704
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:15,445
Wasn't what?

705
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:17,047
<i>(diane)
dr. Cuddy?</i>

706
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:18,848
They need you
in the pediatric icu.

707
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:19,849
Who's they?

708
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:20,850
I don't know.

709
00:31:20,918 --> 00:31:22,252
<i>But I think they're lawyers.</i>

710
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,858
If you guys screwed something
up, just come clean.

711
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:30,727
It's not gonna be that bad.

712
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,298
(ken)
with all due respect,

713
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:36,800
You don't know what's
at stake here.

714
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,001
What's going on?

715
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:39,102
You need to stop him!

716
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,637
He's about to
ruin his life.

717
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:41,538
Like you give
a damn about my life.

718
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:43,073
Roy, he's right.

719
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,342
<i>You're borrowing money
to buy options</i>

720
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:46,643
<i>That are already out
of the money.</i>

721
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:48,144
Even you won't be able
to cover the losses.

722
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:50,714
Your house, cars,
bank accounts.

723
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:51,948
You'll lose everything.

724
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:53,383
<i>(house)
that's the point.</i>

725
00:31:53,451 --> 00:31:56,453
The billionaire thinks
that the gods

726
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,355
Will treat him better
if he's broke.

727
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:00,156
I suggested he give it to me.

728
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:01,324
<i>(roy)
there's got to be some
sort of balance.</i>

729
00:32:01,392 --> 00:32:03,927
You can't have
all the good fortune

730
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:06,329
In just one area
of your life.

731
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:08,565
It's not how the world
is supposed to look.

732
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:10,700
Who said the world
is supposed to work?

733
00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:12,168
<i>Don't just wipe
everything out.</i>

734
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:13,470
Put your assets in a trust.

735
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:14,437
<i>Give it to a charity.</i>

736
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:15,572
I can't get anything back.

737
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:17,474
He's insane.
He's irrational.

738
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:19,376
So are most people.

739
00:32:19,443 --> 00:32:20,844
Unfortunately it doesn't make
him insane.

740
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:22,512
If he signs that paper,

741
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,714
<i>He's not only gonna destroy
his own life,</i>

742
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:26,416
<i>But the lives of thousands
of people who rely</i>

743
00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:27,884
<i>On this company
to make a living.</i>

744
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:29,819
<i>If he is insane,
we will sue this hospital--</i>

745
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:32,422
<i>(cuddy)
mr. Randall...</i>

746
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,724
I know you're upset.

747
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:37,026
You shouldn't make a decision
like this right now.

748
00:32:37,094 --> 00:32:38,995
Give it some time.

749
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:42,632
My son doesn't
have any time.

750
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,367
Your son's dying from
an incurable disease,

751
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:45,535
Not bad karma.

752
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:47,370
No.

753
00:32:47,438 --> 00:32:49,606
He's not dying.

754
00:32:49,673 --> 00:32:52,075
It's not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna let it.

755
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:58,114
Roy, please!

756
00:32:58,182 --> 00:33:00,550
<i>(roy)
I'm sorry.</i>

757
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,986
I can't let him die.

758
00:33:03,053 --> 00:33:04,554
People don't get
what they deserve.

759
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:07,090
They just get
what they get.

760
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:08,792
There's nothing any of us
can do about it.

761
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:19,602
Deliver it
or I'll make sure

762
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,438
You end up the ones
with nothing.

763
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:32,115
[flatline tone]

764
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:34,017
Call a code.
He's flatlining.

765
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:50,893
<i>(thirteen)
thanks.</i>

766
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,494
<i>You're welcome.</i>

767
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:54,129
For what?

768
00:33:54,197 --> 00:33:55,264
For thinking I was worth

769
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:57,399
Breaking the law
to keep around.

770
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:59,568
That's just the way I am,

771
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:01,403
<i>But still don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

772
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:03,539
Cuddy had I.T. Trace all
the I.P. Addresses

773
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:06,208
Who've logged in
to my email account.

774
00:34:06,276 --> 00:34:07,476
There were two.

775
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:09,044
Mine and yours.

776
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:13,582
Obviously house decided he needs
you more than he's--

777
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,350
I already asked house.

778
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,653
And he'd certainly
never lie.

779
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,154
No, he'd lie.

780
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:20,822
Except he wants me gone.

781
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,227
And he'd do a lot better job
of lying than you just did.

782
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:26,929
Really?
It was that bad?

783
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:29,998
No, actually.

784
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:31,500
But it doesn't
matter anymore.

785
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:32,968
Why?

786
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:37,306
<i>Because of house
or foreman?</i>

787
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:40,042
You're good for both
of them,

788
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:41,310
<i>But foreman's
not my best friend.</i>

789
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:42,644
House will be fine.

790
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:45,147
Maybe.

791
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:46,315
But with you on the team,
he'd be better.

792
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:48,450
<i>He needs someone...</i>

793
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:51,353
Who doesn't need him.

794
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:53,088
<i>You're the only one</i>

795
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:54,456
He's never really
been able to suck

796
00:34:54,524 --> 00:34:56,725
Into his crazy house vortex.

797
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:58,927
Keeps him grounded.
His ego in check.

798
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:01,330
Why didn't you just
come to me?

799
00:35:01,397 --> 00:35:06,301
I figured you'd only stay
if house asked

800
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:09,638
And I knew
he would eventually.

801
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:16,044
Bye, wilson.

802
00:35:16,112 --> 00:35:18,947
This is a great job.

803
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,552
Maybe even better now that house
is at least trying

804
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,355
To have real relationships
with people.

805
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:28,190
I said, "trying."

806
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:30,559
It doesn't matter.

807
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:31,693
The job you love
doesn't matter?

808
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:34,229
<i>Don't throw it all away</i>

809
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:36,698
Just because
of a bad break-up.

810
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:42,371
Bye, wilson.

811
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:51,546
[sighs]

812
00:35:51,614 --> 00:35:54,016
I just confessed.

813
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,451
I told thirteen I was the one
who canceled the plane ticket.

814
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,320
Why?

815
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:00,322
You mean why did I confess
or why did I do it?

816
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:04,826
I know you didn't do it,
so I guess the first.

817
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:07,295
You want her to stay because
you want her back

818
00:36:07,363 --> 00:36:08,463
Or because foreman does?

819
00:36:08,531 --> 00:36:11,833
Why would I care
what foreman wants?

820
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:13,669
Because you're not as big a jerk
as everyone thinks.

821
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:15,037
Yes, I am.

822
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:17,439
No, you're not.

823
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:20,108
I just made a $10,000
short sale on a stock

824
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:22,210
I know is gonna crash
because of what I saw

825
00:36:22,278 --> 00:36:24,780
A grief-stricken dad do
on his son's deathbed.

826
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:25,947
No, you didn't.

827
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:27,449
Yes, I did.

828
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:30,218
You are a jerk.

829
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:33,055
She's making a mistake.

830
00:36:33,122 --> 00:36:34,489
So you did it for her?

831
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:36,291
She's a good doctor.

832
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:38,026
<i>So you did it for you?</i>

833
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:39,995
I'm not the one
in charge anymore.

834
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:42,130
So you did it
for foreman?

835
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:45,834
She's a smoking hot,
newly single bisexual.

836
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:49,004
Why don't you just admit that
you like having her around?

837
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:50,806
She's good for you.
You need her.

838
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:54,309
Because I was born with a heart
three sizes too small.

839
00:36:54,377 --> 00:36:55,811
No, you weren't.

840
00:36:55,878 --> 00:36:58,213
Yes, I--

841
00:36:58,281 --> 00:37:01,650
<i>What?</i>

842
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:18,233
He still alive?

843
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:20,068
<i>(foreman)
yeah.
Good.</i>

844
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:21,803
Start him on heparin
and iv immunoglobulin.

845
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:24,072
For degos?

846
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,741
The cardiac arrest
wasn't just a

847
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,342
"everything goes to hell
in a handbasket" arrest.

848
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,044
It was a coronary event.

849
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:30,645
Coronaries are large vessels.
Mean's it can't be degos.

850
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:32,581
But the biopsies confirmed--

851
00:37:32,648 --> 00:37:34,549
Obstructed blood vessels.

852
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:37,185
But they can't be obstructed
because of degos.

853
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:39,955
Means it's primary
antiphospholipid syndrome.

854
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:42,991
You sure?

855
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:44,960
Nope.

856
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:46,361
But I will be if he responds
to the heparin

857
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:48,196
And the immunoglobulin.

858
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,070
By the way,

859
00:37:55,138 --> 00:37:57,539
Someone screwed over
your girlfriend

860
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,975
And she ran to me, cuddy,
and wilson.

861
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,343
Everyone but you.

862
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:04,746
She's not over you.

863
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:07,949
Or she is.

864
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:37,979
Where'd you find it?

865
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:40,882
Find what?

866
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,119
The niacin bound
chromium supplements.

867
00:38:44,187 --> 00:38:45,520
It was right
on top of the file.

868
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:46,621
You don't know about it?

869
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:49,958
No.
Been here all night.

870
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:52,360
One of dibala's previous docs
was prescribing

871
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:55,864
Ultra high doses of niacin bound
chromium to boost his hdl.

872
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:57,532
So?

873
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,234
So it gives us something
to point to.

874
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:00,535
We can explain the wide
variation

875
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:02,204
Between the hdl numbers.

876
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:03,438
We're safe.

877
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:06,942
We're covered.

878
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:08,510
You really didn't
request the info?

879
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:11,213
No.

880
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,882
And obviously
you didn't either.

881
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:19,254
Which means...

882
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:53,154
It worked.

883
00:39:53,222 --> 00:39:55,323
The medicine worked.

884
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:58,827
It worked.

885
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:05,433
[chuckles]

886
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:14,809
How'd you find it?

887
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:20,849
Fat old black guy.

888
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:22,984
Knew he had to be taking
something for his cholesterol.

889
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,420
And what now?

890
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,989
I'm not the boss.

891
00:40:28,057 --> 00:40:29,557
You don't think
I should be fired?

892
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,426
Why?

893
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:35,497
I doubt we'll ever be treating
a genocidal dictator again.

894
00:40:35,564 --> 00:40:38,333
Better a murder
than a misdiagnosis.

895
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:46,174
Whether you want to be
in charge or not...

896
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:50,145
You are and you
always will be.

(foreman)
75-year-old african man

900
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,167
<i>Presented to our hospital
following</i>

901
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:14,536
<i>A rapid onset of hemoptysis.</i>

902
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:16,604
<i>He'd been fine prior to onset.</i>

903
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:21,343
<i>No chest pain, fever,
coughing, or chills...</i>

904
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:26,781
* when we first met *

905
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,049
* we were kids *

906
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:29,451
* we were wild *

907
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:33,455
* we were restless *

908
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:35,290
* after a while *

909
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:36,558
* I grew coarse *

910
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:37,792
* I grew cold *

911
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,496
* I grew reckless *

912
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:44,232
* I hold this memory *

913
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,534
* hold you so close to me *

914
00:41:46,602 --> 00:41:50,105
* whispered we'll be
always happy *

915
00:41:57,713 --> 00:41:59,914
* now I see *

916
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:01,483
* just how young *

917
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:05,954
* how scared I was *

918
00:42:06,022 --> 00:42:09,290
* eyes closed tight *

919
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,694
* throwing punch after punch
at the world *

920
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:15,330

921
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:20,568

922
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:23,371
