1
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:24,398
Let's stay focused, Johnny.

2
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:28,361
What are you looking at?

3
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:30,003
Who is she?

4
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,698
That's Miss Cindy,

5
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:34,023
Zeke's new aide.

6
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:35,660
What happened to his old aide?

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,510
She got married.

8
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,039
So, first,

9
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:42,958
you want to rub the
glue on the paper

10
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,425
in any shapes you like.

11
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:48,464
Why do people get married?

12
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,675
Because they love each other.

13
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,176
Why aren't you married?

14
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:55,389
I haven't found
the person I love yet,

15
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,606
because I spend
all of my time loving you.

16
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:02,728
Does that mean we can get married?

17
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:06,916
Well, love comes in many types,

18
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,414
and there's lots of it to go around.

19
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,988
My snow is ruined.

20
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,449
It's not ruined.

21
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,411
Oh, it's pretty.

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,746
See, look, I like the green.

23
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,415
Who ever heard of green snow?

24
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,083
It's magical.

25
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,234
Come here.

26
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:34,969
We'll get you cleaned up, okay?

27
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:36,494
It's okay.

28
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:40,590
Are you okay?

29
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:01,537
House - Season 05 Episode 13
"Big Baby"

30
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:08,555
Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak

31
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:26,895
www.house-fr.com

32
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:38,324
You gonna pay for that?

33
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:40,572
{\pos(192,210)}Nice of you to offer.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,703
Now I can actually get
some cream cheese.

35
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:45,455
{\pos(192,210)}29-year-old teacher, she works
with special needs children.

36
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,558
{\pos(192,210)}- She...
- Love what you're wearing.

37
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:49,627
{\pos(192,210)}Brings out the blue
of the case file,

38
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,420
which means it's not from the E.R.

39
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,090
{\pos(192,210)}- So why are you here?
- Because Dr. Cuddy is not here.

40
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,102
{\pos(192,210)}She's decided to spend some more time
at home with the baby for a while.

41
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:00,824
{\pos(192,210)}I'm taking over some of her
day-to-day responsibilities, like...

42
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,389
{\pos(192,210)}babysitting you.

43
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:03,523
{\pos(192,210)}Interesting.

44
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:06,093
{\pos(192,210)}You have your whole life
ahead of you.

45
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,829
{\pos(192,210)}So why would Cuddy want you
to die so young?

46
00:03:09,362 --> 00:03:12,424
{\pos(192,210)}She figured I'd spent 3 years
working for you. I was inoculated.

47
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:14,122
{\pos(192,210)}Good.

48
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:15,486
{\pos(192,210)}Fun.

49
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,148
{\pos(192,210)}You get to exercise
your newfound power.

50
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:20,795
{\pos(192,210)}I squirm under your thumb, resent
the student becoming the teacher,

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,139
{\pos(192,210)}and push comes to shove,
and we all get to realize

52
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,067
{\pos(192,210)}what our real roles should be.

53
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,289
Then you put out.

54
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,417
{\pos(192,210)}That's why I took the job.

55
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:47,643
{\pos(192,210)}29-year-old Special Ed. teacher
coughs up blood

56
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:49,247
{\pos(192,210)}all over Corky.

57
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:51,408
{\pos(192,210)}No dyspnea, no weight loss.

58
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:54,358
Why are you smirking?

59
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,987
{\pos(192,210)}Never thought I'd see the day
you were taking orders from Cameron.

60
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,122
She's in charge?

61
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,490
- When did that happen?
- You're gonna destroy her?

62
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,659
I am going to do my job.

63
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,287
{\pos(192,210)}If that involves
leaving her a rotting pulp...

64
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,038
Cameron's gonna mark her territory.

65
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,181
She'll probably overcompensate
and destroy you.

66
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:12,287
{\pos(192,210)}- Bleeding ulcer.
- Scope of the stomach and lungs

67
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:13,273
{\pos(192,210)}were clean,

68
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:16,479
{\pos(192,210)}she continues to spit up blood
from both her stomach and lungs.

69
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,866
{\pos(192,200)}Means it's probably
something wrong with the blood itself.

70
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,400
{\pos(192,200)}Leukemia, Von Willebrand's.

71
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:23,357
{\pos(192,200)}Thoracic tumor is a better fit.
Erodes into her airway and esophagus...

72
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:25,264
{\pos(192,210)}Will you two stop it already?

73
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,641
Stop what?
- Disagreeing.

74
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,935
Okay, which one of us
shouldn't have an opinion?

75
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,479
It's not an opinion.
It's a smoke screen.

76
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:34,982
{\pos(192,210)}Toss out a lame idea,
instead of agreeing

77
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,988
{\pos(192,210)}with Foreman's better idea because
you're worried that'll confirm that

78
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:40,863
{\pos(192,210)}he's boldly gone
where no man has gone before.

79
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:44,199
{\pos(192,210)}- You slept with Foreman?
- Sorry. You were busy.

80
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:45,425
{\pos(192,170)}Drop it, House.

81
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,501
{\pos(192,170)}We're seeing each other,
end of discussion.

82
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:50,679
{\pos(192,210)}- Anything else isn't relevant.
- It's extremely relevant.

83
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:52,708
Apparently, it colors everything.

84
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:55,210
Now I have no idea
if you have differing opinions

85
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,921
because you have differing opinions

86
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,381
or you're trying to prove
that you can think for yourselves.

87
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:02,092
How about you just judge
our ideas on their own merit?

88
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,411
Oh, you don't want me to do that.

89
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:07,973
Go run a bleeding-time test,
confirm our patient's blood is screwy.

90
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,240
Then you can come back
and pretend to disagree about why.

91
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:18,672
Time Zero.

92
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,486
I'm impressed.
You didn't even flinch.

93
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:23,739
I just went to my happy place.

94
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:27,743
We cannot let House
anywhere near this woman.

95
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:30,296
- Where is your happy place?
- My class,

96
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:31,588
with them.

97
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,458
- Passed the first mark.
- It's a great thing you do.

98
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:35,834
Not really.

99
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,295
Most kids, typical children,

100
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:41,087
you hand them a pair
of scissors, and they cut.

101
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:43,341
Well, Tony, he's got C.P.,

102
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:45,970
and when I gave him the scissors,
we...

103
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,115
went on a journey together,

104
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:50,348
learning to get his fingers
in those holes,

105
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,310
to hold the scissors apart,
to hold the paper.

106
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,859
I mean, when
he finally learned to cut,

107
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:58,857
we both just... wept with joy.

108
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:05,072
If you ever meet our boss,
just yes or no answers, okay?

109
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:10,160
It's not slowing up.
No sign of clotting.

110
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,829
So there is something wrong
with my blood?

111
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,848
Don't worry,
we'll run some lab tests

112
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,376
- to find out which clotting factor...
- I'm not worried.

113
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,639
Must be one hell of a happy place.

114
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:30,254
She's beautiful.

115
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:32,349
I know. I'm lucky.

116
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:33,917
Absolutely.

117
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:37,630
What's she like?

118
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:40,207
She's eight weeks old.

119
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:43,833
Are you asking me about her
politics or her sense of humor?

120
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,174
My cousin had a kid.
They acted like they knew the thing

121
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,182
from the time it was
two minutes old. I just,

122
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,299
I just thought...

123
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:51,160
She cries, she eats, and she poops.

124
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,788
What's wrong?

125
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,126
I don't feel anything.

126
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,613
You're tired.

127
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:14,316
I'm not sleep deprived.
She sleeps fine.

128
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:17,661
I'm obviously not hormonal.

129
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:23,583
I know I'm supposed
to feel amazement.

130
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm supposed to love her.

131
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:28,304
I just...

132
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:32,034
I don't feel anything at all.

133
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,461
Sorry.

134
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:38,457
Maybe I am just tired.

135
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:42,852
Thank you for stopping by.
I'm okay.

136
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,314
If you're...

137
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:49,309
I am feeding her,

138
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:51,503
I'm changing her,
and I'm burping her.

139
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:53,506
I'm doing everything
I'm supposed to do.

140
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:55,891
She will be okay.

141
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,728
Please go back to work.

142
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:14,501
It is the blood, but the clotting
proteins aren't the problem.

143
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:17,204
It's her platelets, looked like
they had bite marks in them.

144
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,180
So now you're agreeing?

145
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:22,120
Either you folded because
I gave you crap, or you broke up...

146
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:24,215
We disagree,
you blame our relationship.

147
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,272
We agree, you blame
our relationship.

148
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:27,881
- Don't you see a problem?
- Yes.

149
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,937
- Don't you?
- Could be lymphoma.

150
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:32,335
- Not with normal LDH.
- I.T.P. fits.

151
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,860
- We should start her on methotrexate.
- Absolutely,

152
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:36,932
and total body irradiation.

153
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,226
Because she failed
a bleeding-time test?

154
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,436
TBI will promote cancers,
kill her digestive tract.

155
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,980
Don't forget... stop her
from bleeding into her brain.

156
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,799
It's premature, reckless,
and potentially lethal.

157
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,161
True. Must be somebody's job

158
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:51,538
to stop me from being reckless
and irresponsible.

159
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:54,074
Nobody can stop me
from being premature.

160
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:01,752
Got a patient with I.T.P.
Need to hit her with radiation.

161
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:03,806
I'm gonna have to call you back.

162
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,502
- Methotrexate.
- Good point.

163
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:08,263
On the other hand,
if she bleeds in her brain,

164
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:10,820
she's gonna need
a Special Ed. class of her own.

165
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:13,909
Fine.

166
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:18,348
- Really?
- Yeah, if you think it's right, do it.

167
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,310
Some people thought
you were gonna be brutal,

168
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:23,903
marking your territory.

169
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:25,439
- Who?
- Nobody.

170
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,108
Just because I call him nobody
doesn't make me a racist.

171
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:30,147
I'm not gonna play games.

172
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,812
If you come to me with a request
and it makes medical sense,

173
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,047
I'll say yes.

174
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:36,783
I need oral sex.

175
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:41,622
I'm pretty sure biological imperative
qualifies as medical sense.

176
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:44,082
Can I return my phone call now?

177
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,935
I don't really see
how that's gonna be possible.

178
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:01,692
Patient won't respond
to methotrexate.

179
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,733
- Bleeding time hasn't improved.
- You have a medical dilemma for me.

180
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:05,940
I have one for you.

181
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:08,361
I need a reason to not do
total body irradiation.

182
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:10,339
Other than that Cameron
said you can't.

183
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,786
- She said I can.
- Then why don't we just do it?

184
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:15,865
Because it's premature, reckless,
and potentially lethal.

185
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,007
Then why don't we just don't do it?

186
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:20,894
Because that would let Cameron in on
the fact that I never intended to do it.

187
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,413
This is gonna be convoluted,
isn't it?

188
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,465
I figured I'd ask
for something really crazy,

189
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,275
she'd shoot me down
and get the whole

190
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,694
"I can control House" thing
out of her perky little system.

191
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,151
The next time I went back

192
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:33,020
And asked for something
marginally crazy,

193
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:35,584
it would seem marginally
reasonable, and she'd say yes.

194
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,970
So, yeah, slightly convoluted.

195
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:39,803
You're screwed.

196
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:41,706
Unless we irradiate her...

197
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:44,434
without the radiation.

198
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,786
We book the nuclear lab.
We fill out the paperwork.

199
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,771
We bring the patient down there.
We do everything but flip the switch.

200
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:51,268
Go. Do.

201
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:52,484
Don't flip.

202
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:55,627
And is there anything
we should be doing, you know,

203
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:57,613
to actually help the patient?

204
00:10:57,738 --> 00:11:00,488
Trust me. In the long term,
this'll help all our patients.

205
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:03,537
In the short term, double the dose
of methotrexate and add prednisone.

206
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:09,851
Cameron's got the keys
to the castle.

207
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:12,613
This trial I'm running, the drug
really seems to be working.

208
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,399
She's kind of liking the power.

209
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:17,217
I think I'm kind of liking her
liking it.

210
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,861
I'm not sure what I'm gonna do
about Thirteen.

211
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,638
She's sort of dressing like Cuddy.

212
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:25,141
She's on the placebo.

213
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:28,486
- You can't possibly know that.
- Accidents happen.

214
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:29,646
I found out.

215
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,334
You cannot tell her.

216
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:37,887
Tell her,
you'd be compromising the trial.

217
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,533
She knows she had a 50/50 chance
of not being on the drug.

218
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,483
If you feel like you're lying
to her, too bad.

219
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,121
I don't want to tell her.

220
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:50,558
I want to put her on the real drug.

221
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,503
And you want me to tell you
that that's okay?

222
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,734
Her trial results
are already compromised,

223
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,382
just from the fact that I know.

224
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:59,008
She's wasting her time,

225
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,054
Why not give her something
that might actually help her?

226
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:04,231
Valid point,

227
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:07,100
except for the fact
that it's a load of crap.

228
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:11,355
Don't be an idiot.

229
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,100
So how long
until we start the procedure?

230
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:28,538
We already started.
Told you you wouldn't feel a thing.

231
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:32,584
You should lie back.
Just stay real still.

232
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,835
<i>I'm afraid there
is someone sitting next to you.</i>

233
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:36,520
God, God, God!

234
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:39,920
I have to pee.

235
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:42,590
Can we, like, call a
timeout for a minute,

236
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:44,364
let me go to the bathroom?

237
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:48,875
<i>Yeah, sure. We'll just
start up again when you're done.</i>

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,143
Thanks.

239
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:53,271
Sorry. I... I didn't realize
I had to go.

240
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:54,603
No problem.

241
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:04,790
No pulse. Get the paddles.

242
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:11,665
Clear!

243
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,336
Got a pulse.

244
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:17,838
It's not I.T.P.

245
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:24,601
No structural defectsnin her heart.

246
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:27,859
What about a calcified valve
or a patent foramen ovale?

247
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:30,129
Transthoracic echo and
bubble studies show nothing.

248
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:31,351
Her heart's clean.

249
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:33,076
The patient said she had to go pee.

250
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:35,345
Maybe when she got up,
she started to urinate.

251
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,191
Increased the vagal tone, caused
arrhythmia, and stopped her heart.

252
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:40,986
Who has to go pee in the middle
of a nuclear procedure?

253
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:44,072
- It wasn't really a nuclear procedure.
- She didn't know that.

254
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:49,119
People don't die from peeing.

255
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:51,320
Heavy metal, toxin.

256
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:54,541
- Drugs or alcohol.
- Or her own body is making a toxin.

257
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:58,336
Cold agglutinins, abnormal protein
gets activated by cold temperatures.

258
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:01,465
Like the classroom with the broken
heater and the cold metal table.

259
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,300
Oh, for God's sake, get a room.

260
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,846
Immerse her in an ice bath. The cold
will activate her cold agglutinins.

261
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,223
- Causing her heart to race.
- Confirming our diagnosis.

262
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:11,892
And giving her another heart attack.

263
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:15,353
Lucky for me, there's a flaxen-haired
maiden who loves to say yes.

264
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:21,338
How could you approve
total body irradiation

265
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:24,112
- for a patient with possible I.T.P.?
- It was the right call.

266
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:26,824
- There is no medical justification...
- Not medically, no.

267
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,285
Absolutely
no medical rationalization.

268
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:32,578
I had to say yes
because House wanted me to say no.

269
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:35,999
- You think he was bluffing.
- I'm the new kid. He had to test me.

270
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:39,003
Don't get cute. Don't engage him.

271
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:41,963
Do not play his games,
because you will lose.

272
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:44,650
You hired me to do this job.
Let me do it.

273
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:49,512
Oh, I'm sorry.

274
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,674
Looks like you guys are
in the middle of a conversation.

275
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,579
I can wait till Cuddy leaves.

276
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:58,371
You are gonna leave soon,
aren't you?

277
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:01,340
I mean, the nurses have got
your baby out there.

278
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,777
Not that they're gonna kidnap it
or anything, but

279
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:06,688
I figured that the new
mother brings the baby to work

280
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,715
because she wants to listen
to all the cooing.

281
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,700
If you're gonna wait,
you can wait outside.

282
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:13,462
Unless the new mother
brings the baby to work

283
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:16,079
because she wants to dump the baby,

284
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,624
because she hates the baby

285
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,791
and thinks she made a big mistake.

286
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:26,558
Can't trust that Wilson guy
with anything.

287
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,918
- Are you...
- It's not a big deal.

288
00:15:30,043 --> 00:15:32,514
- I was having a bad day.
- Is Wilson gonna be in trouble?

289
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:36,316
For betraying my trust
in a vulnerable time? No.

290
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:39,003
- Why would that bother me?
- He was worried,

291
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:40,480
made a bad choice.

292
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:44,324
It's not a big deal.

293
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:48,321
I know it seems like crap. You probably
feel like crap, but it's not.

294
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:51,866
Legally, you haven't adopted her yet.
There's no obligations, no strings.

295
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:54,494
It can be undone tomorrow.
Emotionally,

296
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:56,779
you'll feel guilty for a while,

297
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:58,347
but the kid...

298
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,376
she won't even know you existed.

299
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:02,460
You saying I should give her back?

300
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:05,839
Much better than having a mother
who doesn't give a crap.

301
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:09,141
Thanks.

302
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,137
I'm just gonna go drop it off
at the pound.

303
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:18,560
What did you want?

304
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:25,032
We got a green light.
Go draw the patient's blood.

305
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:26,178
Why?

306
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:28,111
To see if it clumps in the cold.

307
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:30,429
She's making you confirm
your theory before you treat?

308
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,231
She approved the bath.

309
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,326
Just thought we ought to do
a test to confirm.

310
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,736
That's more
of a yellow light, isn't it?

311
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,955
So she let's you nuke
the patient, no problem,

312
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:42,626
but makes you jump through hoops
to give her a bath?

313
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,461
Why would she do that?

314
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:46,617
I think she was playing you.

315
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,715
Go draw the blood.

316
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:56,431
Didn't realize the nurses
allowed any visitors in here.

317
00:16:56,602 --> 00:16:57,723
They don't.

318
00:16:58,173 --> 00:17:00,935
We'll just do these problems,
And then you have to go, okay?

319
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:03,730
I need to draw some blood.

320
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:08,034
I had a crush on my teacher
in fourth grade... and fifth.

321
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:09,986
It's more that.

322
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,338
Johnny was a nonverbal autistic.

323
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:14,240
Then for Sarah,

324
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:16,618
he talks, makes eye contact.

325
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:18,244
He's like a regular kid.

326
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,919
Since she got sick, he started going
back away from us.

327
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,261
I had to bring him in for a visit.

328
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:25,502
I'll tell you what,

329
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,688
I'll close the blinds so
the nurses don't ask questions.

330
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,715
You can stay as long as you want.

331
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:32,684
We should have the results
in about an hour.

332
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,194
I'll be here.

333
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:39,766
Good job.

334
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:42,227
One minute at 39 degrees.

335
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,313
Oh, damn, sorry.

336
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:47,897
You all right?

337
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,987
Don't be paranoid. I feel great.

338
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:53,279
Didn't expect the meds
to work this quickly.

339
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:56,701
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
You might not even be on the real drug.

340
00:17:57,295 --> 00:18:00,574
Several patients have shown improvement.
I know my test results have been better.

341
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:02,205
I know I have more energy.

342
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:04,334
You ever hear the term
placebo effect?

343
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,670
I guess I do have a few reasons
to feel good,

344
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:10,653
but...

345
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,657
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
You're good,

346
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:16,143
but not "curing Huntington's" good.

347
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:20,472
Good.

348
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:31,653
It's clumped.
House was right. Ice bath's on.

349
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:34,738
Got a sec?

350
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:38,366
Don't be an idiot.

351
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:50,165
<i>I know it's hard, but you need
to stay in there for three minutes.</i>

352
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,087
<i>It's OK.</i>

353
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:56,133
You come to procedures now?

354
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,178
Only the ones that might involve
stopping the patient's heart.

355
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,220
Cameron tell you to be here?

356
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:02,281
Shut up.

357
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,893
<i>Tell me about Jonathan.
How'd you get him to come out of hiding?</i>

358
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:07,729
<i>He was extremely sensitive to touch,</i>

359
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,524
yet he had a-a tactile
fascination with newspaper.

360
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,334
I mean, he wouldn't read it,
he would just touch it,

361
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,364
crinkle it.

362
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:20,617
I thought maybe that was a way in,

363
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,747
Papier mache and...

364
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:25,871
And it was.

365
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,148
He let me into his world.

366
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:30,753
Please tell her that talking
will ruin the test.

367
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,179
All the kids, I try to...

368
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,283
<i>to become a part of them, and then
have them become a part of me.</i>

369
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:39,344
How much longer
till the heart attack?

370
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:41,927
<i>I wanted to be a doctor from
the time I was eight years old.</i>

371
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:43,847
<i>Never wanted to be
a pediatrician, though.</i>

372
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,358
Now they're both talking.

373
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,312
<i>Well, I wanted to be a sociologist.</i>

374
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:51,649
I was supposed to observe a class.
I was sent to room 2...

375
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,857
241

376
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:55,985
but I went to room 241 instead.

377
00:19:57,444 --> 00:19:59,490
It was a Special Ed. class,
and I just...

378
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,191
I just felt at home.

379
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:05,096
Time.
Heart rate's normal.

380
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,656
You can get out now.

381
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,559
It's not cold agglutinins.

382
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,418
I'm not surprised.

383
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,174
She obviously has brain damage.

384
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:19,434
Seriously.

385
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:23,971
She screwed up a room number
six years ago,

386
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:26,003
and you decide she has brain damage?

387
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:27,827
Transposed digits...

388
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:31,217
classic marker for number confusion.

389
00:20:31,342 --> 00:20:34,065
Means she has a lesion in her
left parahippocampal region.

390
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:36,776
I misdialed a phone number this morning.
Must be contagious.

391
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:39,612
She also forgot to pee
before your fake test.

392
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:41,001
She has a small bladder.

393
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:43,074
Shows an inability
to predict the future.

394
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:45,535
Also located in the left hemisphere
of the brain,

395
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:48,543
- Close to the parahippocampal region.
- Means the damage is ongoing.

396
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:51,249
Two subtle clues six years apart...
that's hardly compelling evidence.

397
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,665
- I'm compelled.
- That's not what this is.

398
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,072
Every time a decent person

399
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:57,547
comes in, you set out to prove
that they have brain damage.

400
00:20:57,718 --> 00:20:59,966
I never said her deranged
personality was a symptom.

401
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:02,142
You don't need to.
I've been here five years.

402
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:04,263
I can hear your thoughts
from my apartment.

403
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:06,806
Can you hear me now?

404
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:10,310
Move on to another organ.

405
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:11,648
I did.

406
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,243
The screwed up numbers
and forgetting to pee

407
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:15,903
points to her being a human being.

408
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:19,060
The platelet dysfunction and cardiac
arrest points to a pancreatic tumor.

409
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:21,777
Or multiple sclerosis.

410
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,044
The brain is like the internet...

411
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:26,910
Packets of information
constantly flowing

412
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:28,987
from one area to another.

413
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:31,789
Plaques in her brain
are like a bad server,

414
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,585
slow down the flow.
If it's in the parahippocampus,

415
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,755
it'll spread to the brain stem,
which means it'll be the lungs next.

416
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:41,799
Brain biopsy
will show you the plaques.

417
00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:44,076
Or we could not cut into her brain.

418
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:46,930
It's just her pancreas.
We should do an ERCP.

419
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:50,016
We could settle this
with rock, paper, scissors,

420
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:51,183
<i>but...</i>

421
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:54,749
unfortunately, there are people
who adjudicate these disputes.

422
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,486
A pancreatic tumor is much more
likely to kill her

423
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:00,110
Not this week, not next week,
Not next month.

424
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,910
The number confusion
was six years ago.

425
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:04,896
- We have time for an ERCP, no?
- The heart attack was 6 hours ago.

426
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,202
Now, maybe it's planning to go
hiding for a couple years,

427
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,910
or maybe it's gonna hit her lungs.

428
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:12,205
We have to assume it's the brain.

429
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:15,716
I'll go fire up the biopsy drill.

430
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:17,961
No, we had to assume it's the brain

431
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:19,701
until we prove otherwise.

432
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:21,172
Do an MRI, T-2 images.

433
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:25,635
You want me to do another test?

434
00:22:25,806 --> 00:22:27,581
You should be able to see
the M.S. plaques.

435
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:29,973
If they exist,
you can do your biopsy.

436
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:37,939
You want to say yes.

437
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,524
You know you should say yes,

438
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,360
but you also think that this job
is about standing up to me.

439
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,849
So you're not gonna say yes.
You're not gonna say no.

440
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:46,783
You're just gonna waste time.

441
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,741
And the patient's brain,
or pancreas,

442
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,452
whatever is wrong isn't gonna
wait that you impress your boss.

443
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,444
So pick one... either him or me.

444
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:56,159
Do the MRI.

445
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:12,265
You're still here?

446
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:15,773
The whole point of giving Cameron
the job was so that you could...

447
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:17,362
- I don't want to go home.

448
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:28,211
House told me
I should give her back.

449
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,284
Instead of being offended,

450
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:33,704
I've been wondering if he's right.

451
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:35,634
He's not.

452
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:36,998
He never is,

453
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:40,376
Not when it's anything personal,
or human,

454
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:42,670
- Or...
- No, he's always cold.

455
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:46,466
He's always an ass,
but he's very rarely just wrong.

456
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,760
I've read...

457
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:51,835
every bonding
and attachment book there is.

458
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:54,432
I feel like I'm in prison at home.

459
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:56,281
I feel like I'm free here.

460
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:59,378
Parents make sacrifices.

461
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,356
I don't know if I want to.

462
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,235
I'm not proud of this.

463
00:24:06,756 --> 00:24:08,303
I feel terrible.

464
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,356
I feel like a failure.

465
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:19,999
But she deserves to be loved.

466
00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:22,738
I-I...

467
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:24,796
I don't know what to say.

468
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,136
No plaques on the left hemisphere.

469
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:33,287
Or the right.

470
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:36,516
Even magnified images of her
hippocampal region, nothing.

471
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:40,113
This is surprising.

472
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,556
So can we cancel the biopsy?

473
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,682
Go ahead with the ERCP.

474
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,317
I need to talk to you about Remy.

475
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:56,547
- Who?
- Thirteen.

476
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,413
- What did you call her?
- She's on placebo.

477
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:03,417
And you want to change that.

478
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,256
I'm the last person you'd ever
come to for ethical advice,

479
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:08,889
literally,

480
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:11,892
which means you've already asked
every other person,

481
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:14,137
and no one's given you
the answer you want.

482
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:17,266
Or I respect your opinion, and
I want to hear what comes to your mind.

483
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:20,977
Has she invited any of her lesbian
friends into bed with you?

484
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:22,770
I was mistaken.

485
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:24,564
Drug gonna cure her?

486
00:25:27,145 --> 00:25:29,402
It looks promising,
reducing symptoms.

487
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:32,617
- No cure then.
- So the pros are:

488
00:25:33,353 --> 00:25:34,991
You might delay
the onset of symptoms,

489
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:36,786
Give her an extra year, maybe three.

490
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,320
She's still dead before you're 45.

491
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:41,288
The question is, are those few years

492
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:43,834
worth risking the rest
of your life in medicine?

493
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,005
No.

494
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,901
There, that wasn't so hard, was it?

495
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:54,093
Thank you.

496
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:56,020
You're welcome.

497
00:25:58,269 --> 00:25:59,720
Unless you love her.

498
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,464
If you love her,

499
00:26:07,437 --> 00:26:08,816
you do stupid things.

500
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:18,826
Common bile duct is clear.

501
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:21,429
No filling defects
in the biliary tree.

502
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:22,997
- Oh, God.
- What?

503
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:25,071
It's her lungs.
House was right.

504
00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:26,335
O-2 SAT's down to 89.

505
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:29,212
- Increase to 100% O-2.
- Better get out.

506
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:37,136
Do we have to tell him?

507
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:45,603
The surgeons were able to
drain the pleural effusions.

508
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:48,606
The patient's breathing on her own,
but she's still pretty weak.

509
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:51,617
Lung failure proves
that one of us was right.

510
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:52,944
Who said brain?

511
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,988
Yes, you predicted
that her lungs would fail,

512
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,907
but the MRI was negative for M.S.

513
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:59,744
I was right about the where,
but not the what.

514
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,888
A picornavirus could cause
localized demyelination

515
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:06,582
that the MRI wouldn't pick up.

516
00:27:07,145 --> 00:27:10,211
If we run a nerve-conduction study
on the surface of her brain,

517
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:12,213
we'll see the dead spots.

518
00:27:12,384 --> 00:27:14,546
Are you talking
about cutting into her skull?

519
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:17,176
Actually, I'm talking
about cutting off her skull,

520
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:18,552
exposing her brain.

521
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,471
A pancreatic tumor could still fit.

522
00:27:20,643 --> 00:27:22,266
Explains heart, blood, and lungs.

523
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,599
ERCP was negative.

524
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:25,685
And she agrees with me

525
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:28,502
because she agrees with me,
right, sweetie?

526
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:31,482
All we need is a more sensitive test.
Endoscopic ultrasound.

527
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:34,819
Just accept that
you've been proven wrong.

528
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:38,739
You were also proven wrong.
Why don't I get a second test?

529
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:40,614
Because if I'm right
about the brain,

530
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:42,743
then we don't have time
to indulge your wrongness.

531
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:47,688
Let me know when Cameron says yes
to cutting off our patient's skull.

532
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:50,260
I'll be doing
the endoscopic ultrasound.

533
00:27:53,027 --> 00:27:53,921
Good news.

534
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:58,124
I don't need your approval
for some crazy, unproven treatment.

535
00:27:58,249 --> 00:27:59,468
I just need to do a test.

536
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,345
You want to remove
your patient's skull.

537
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:04,905
Remind me to revoke
Kutner's telephone privileges.

538
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,977
I didn't realize that was
an A.M.A.-approved treatment for M.S.

539
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:10,377
Not searching for M.S.,
but what set it off--

540
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:12,279
Equine encephalitis.

541
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,818
Turned a cool breeze of M.S.
into a CAT-5 storm.

542
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,943
I didn't realize
your patient was a horse.

543
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:19,655
There's been human cases.

544
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:22,683
Not when it's 30 degrees outside.
Transmission is by mosquito.

545
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:26,412
So she got bitten six months ago,
or it's some other infection.

546
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:29,084
Whatever it is, it's running rampant
in the left side of her brain.

547
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,257
When I get in there,
I'll get you the specifics.

548
00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:34,802
You're asking me to let you cut
off the top of someone's head.

549
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:36,943
I need more than,
"I'll know it when I see it."

550
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,507
You want proof before you let
me go looking for the proof?

551
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:42,333
- This is the test.
- You have to give me something.

552
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:48,318
Cuddy's gonna love you.

553
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:50,417
The patient, on the other hand,

554
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:53,481
is gonna hate you until the day
she dies next week.

555
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,276
Actually, this idiot
will probably forgive you.

556
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:08,269
You gonna help or what?

557
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:10,186
I want kids.

558
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:14,754
I think these kids
are already spoken for.

559
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:15,879
Not now.

560
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:19,547
But since we're dating,
I just thought you should know.

561
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:22,037
But I thought,
because of your illness...

562
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,162
So did I.

563
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:26,722
Even when I didn't know
if I had it or not, I just...

564
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:29,936
assumed I couldn't take the chance,
but now...

565
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:33,437
Even though I know I have it,
it feels like...

566
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,464
an option.

567
00:29:47,357 --> 00:29:49,410
You really don't have
to keep buying me things.

568
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:50,862
Just open it.

569
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:57,267
This is nice.

570
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:02,633
The picture is actually your gift.

571
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,127
That's your baby.

572
00:30:07,494 --> 00:30:10,558
I took her picture to that place
that does that age-enhancement thing.

573
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:12,733
And according to the kid
who works there,

574
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:14,522
this is a pretty good approximation

575
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,338
of what your daughter will look
like 18 years from now.

576
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,985
That's sort of cool.

577
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:23,468
Right now she's just
this weird little creature that...

578
00:30:23,593 --> 00:30:26,037
sleeps, and poops, and cries.

579
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:27,884
But that...

580
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:30,047
is who she's gonna be.

581
00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:33,289
You will be teaching her
how to ride a bike,

582
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:36,724
giving her advice
about friends and school

583
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:38,294
and having her heart broken.

584
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:41,255
She'll ignore most of it,
but some of it'll stick.

585
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,842
You're gonna be there for her
through all of that.

586
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:47,444
You just have to get
through this part.

587
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:48,573
That's all.

588
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:54,019
It's very sweet.

589
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,598
I'll pay you back for the photo.

590
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,981
Don't worry about it. It's just
the picture that came with the frame.

591
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:07,498
You can chuck it.

592
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:20,801
Kid with a raging viral syndrome

593
00:31:21,764 --> 00:31:23,865
And three dead mosquitoes.

594
00:31:25,387 --> 00:31:27,801
I'm off to storm the bastille.

595
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,852
These aren't mosquitoes.

596
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,556
Fruit flies... close enough.

597
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:34,391
Acute viral nasopharyngitis?

598
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:37,827
One of her students
has the common cold?

599
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,067
Team's not what it used to be.

600
00:31:40,907 --> 00:31:43,262
On the other hand,
Kutner ran his endoscopic ultrasound.

601
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:44,443
Didn't find peep.

602
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:46,690
So disproving it's her pancreas
proves it's her brain?

603
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:47,655
Yes.

604
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:51,911
You used to do this job, remember?
That's what used to pass for evidence.

605
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:55,371
Now I do this job. You brought me
three dead bugs and a runny nose.

606
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:58,171
I can't find you the proof you want
Because it's trapped inside her head.

607
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:00,756
And the only way I can get at it
Is to cut it open and rip it out,

608
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,752
Which is the one test
you won't let me run.

609
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,519
So either I do this,
or I do nothing.

610
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,010
What do you want me to do?

611
00:32:06,386 --> 00:32:08,403
Say yes just because you're House?

612
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,429
I'd certainly like that, yeah.

613
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:20,214
Yes.

614
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,206
Cameron actually said yes?

615
00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:36,996
Nope, I'm just obsessive
about clean cuticles.

616
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,013
Sawing off the top of her skull

617
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:41,337
and placing electrodes
on her brain is insane.

618
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:44,454
Right, we should be retesting
her pancreas for the umpteenth time.

619
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:46,380
You're skipping steps
because it's Cameron.

620
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:49,216
- You wanna see how far you can push.
- I'm skipping steps

621
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:52,011
because our patient is skipping
steps on the way to being dead.

622
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,888
- If you've got a better idea...
- We should remove her spleen.

623
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,706
Splenic lymphoma
explains the damaged platelets,

624
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:59,155
the heart, the lungs.

625
00:33:00,716 --> 00:33:02,730
If this doesn't work,
the spleen's all yours.

626
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:06,383
Unless I kill her, of course.

627
00:33:08,022 --> 00:33:11,572
Not only will this allow us
to clock your brain's processing speed,

628
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:15,034
You'll also get free cable
for the first three months.

629
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,171
What's this?

630
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:18,746
A blue car.

631
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,914
Is that part of the test?

632
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:23,417
Nope, my lease is up next month.
You like?

633
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:27,124
I'm gonna ask you a series
of questions

634
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:29,006
designed to stimulate
left-brain function.

635
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:32,009
<i>Logic, reasoning, problem-solving.</i>

636
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:34,986
Or as my mentor, Old Ben,
liked to call it,

637
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,378
"the dark side."

638
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:39,780
If we find slow areas,
we know we found damage.

639
00:33:39,905 --> 00:33:41,466
We treat. You go home.
Ready?

640
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:44,188
I'd nod yes,
but I can't move my head.

641
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:46,982
This pen is red.

642
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:48,791
Its ink is red.

643
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,361
Is all ink red?

644
00:33:52,052 --> 00:33:55,074
Nerve conduction's 12.8 meters
per second, right within range.

645
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:57,478
Cameron's letting him cut
into our patient's skull

646
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,953
based on nothing but dead bugs
and someone else's runny nose.

647
00:34:00,358 --> 00:34:02,831
There are two pints in a quart,
four quarts in a gallon.

648
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:05,042
How many pints in five gallons?

649
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,455
<i>Step away from the patient.</i>

650
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,422
Who's that?

651
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:14,259
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

652
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:16,845
That's my old boss.

653
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:19,321
And by "old," I don't mean "former."

654
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:21,308
Insulting me
is not gonna make me go away.

655
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,559
You're not here.

656
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:25,002
<i>Obviously I'm not trying
to make you go away.</i>

657
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,022
Hint... the answer is a number.

658
00:34:29,613 --> 00:34:30,484
40?

659
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:33,836
12.4 meters per second.
Conduction is still normal.

660
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:36,323
Dr. Cameron, you're actually
assisting him with this?

661
00:34:36,495 --> 00:34:38,909
Yes, because I'm actually
familiar with this case.

662
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:40,619
I'm familiar enough to know

663
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:43,080
that cutting into this woman's
brain is not necessary.

664
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,331
Is she serious?

665
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,958
She's certainly not funny.

666
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,876
Put the phone down.

667
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:49,962
Pick up the baby.
Make us all happy.

668
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:53,132
OK, settle down, baby.
It's okay.

669
00:34:53,303 --> 00:34:54,717
We'll be done in a minute.

670
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:56,385
<i>I can call security.</i>

671
00:34:56,556 --> 00:34:58,394
- <i>I can...</i>
- BP's dropping.

672
00:34:58,802 --> 00:35:00,723
Get it back up.
I got a whole stack of these.

673
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:02,307
Give her ten Ccs dopamine.

674
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,807
Already am, thanks.

675
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:06,068
Your baby needs you
a lot more than we do.

676
00:35:06,193 --> 00:35:07,825
<i>You aren't hungry,
and you aren't wet.</i>

677
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,226
I don't know what it is.

678
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:12,109
Oh, that is so annoying.
Can you make it stop?

679
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:14,570
The baby's crying is annoying you?

680
00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:18,741
- What's her nerve conduction?
- 14.3-- it's actually speeding up.

681
00:35:19,271 --> 00:35:21,750
But her BP's 80 over palp.
We're gonna have to stop.

682
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:23,954
That doesn't make any sense.

683
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:26,147
The fact that you're wrong
doesn't make any sense,

684
00:35:26,272 --> 00:35:28,064
or the fact that I believed
you were right?

685
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:30,452
<i>BP's still dropping.
She's gonna stroke.</i>

686
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,727
I'm giving her ten more Ccs,

687
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:34,381
And I'm putting an end to this.

688
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:39,136
Okay, Rachel, quiet down!

689
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,054
I need you to be quiet!

690
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:43,599
Please, turn that phone off!

691
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:47,561
Why does the baby annoy you,
but no one else does?

692
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,712
I mean, you're right
about her, but...

693
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:52,941
I don't know what you want!
I will give you anything that you want!

694
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:55,184
I don't know what it is!

695
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:59,519
Tell me!
Please, just help me!

696
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:00,785
Please!

697
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:08,686
Really?

698
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,794
That worked?

699
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:17,174
She's stable.

700
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:19,218
We're finished here.

701
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:20,956
Close her up.

702
00:36:34,102 --> 00:36:35,984
How long until we can perform
the splenectomy?

703
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:37,676
Can't dose her with anesthesia

704
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:39,571
till the last batch
completely clears.

705
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:41,443
How come the baby annoyed her?

706
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:43,417
We should get her in there
as soon as we can.

707
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:44,598
Two hours at least.

708
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:47,608
Her blood pressure's in the tank.
I hope she lasts two hours.

709
00:36:49,377 --> 00:36:50,883
What was different?

710
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:54,753
Our patient
loves all things annoying.

711
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,339
She'd love this conversation.

712
00:36:57,511 --> 00:36:59,665
She's an earth mother,

713
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,301
takes in the freaks
and rejects of humanity

714
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:04,972
And tells them they're a-okay.
So what was different?

715
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:07,306
Her head was open,

716
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:09,107
you were asking her questions,

717
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:10,894
A baby was crying.

718
00:37:11,492 --> 00:37:13,265
She had low blood pressure.

719
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:16,921
According to the laws of physics,

720
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:19,484
low blood pressure
causes light-headedness,

721
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:20,735
chest pain,

722
00:37:21,832 --> 00:37:23,492
but not annoyance.

723
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:41,108
Move your feet.

724
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:43,805
You decided to keep her.

725
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,846
Thank you for telling me.
You can go now.

726
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,085
I talked to her.

727
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:53,770
We connected.

728
00:37:55,057 --> 00:37:56,355
You talked at her.

729
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:58,726
You had a chemical reaction.

730
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:00,319
You trying to annoy me?

731
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,904
I'm trying to explain you.

732
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:04,321
I know it doesn't
make any sense, but...

733
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:06,033
it was real.

734
00:38:06,673 --> 00:38:07,993
<i>It was there.</i>

735
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:10,278
You want to hold her?

736
00:38:10,403 --> 00:38:12,114
Come up here.
Come say hi.

737
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:15,659
You think we'll bond?

738
00:38:27,126 --> 00:38:29,473
- Is that cute?
- A little.

739
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:32,309
If I threw up on you,
you'd be pissed.

740
00:38:33,387 --> 00:38:35,687
Your puke isn't as cute.

741
00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:37,985
That's 'cause of your hips.

742
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,690
If she would've just gestated
a little longer,

743
00:38:40,815 --> 00:38:42,778
her stomach sphincter
would be fully mature.

744
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:43,935
But, no,

745
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:45,486
we have to walk upright,

746
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:48,107
which means that baby's head
is too big for mommy's hips.

747
00:38:48,232 --> 00:38:51,378
And by the way, your hips may be
an evolutionary improvement.

748
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,374
So we've evolved
to find baby puke cute,

749
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:57,167
<i>'cause otherwise we'd kill them all</i>

750
00:38:57,339 --> 00:38:59,086
before they became functional.

751
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:07,970
Bonding's over.

752
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,398
I got to go see another baby.

753
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:17,187
So I can just live spleen-free?

754
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:20,029
Plenty of people live
perfectly normal lives without...

755
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:21,274
Spleen's fine

756
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:24,424
- It's not her brain.
- Of course it's her brain.

757
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:26,678
You looked at her brain.
You took off her skull.

758
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:27,823
You found nothing.

759
00:39:28,144 --> 00:39:29,783
Didn't look in the right part.

760
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:32,869
Didn't look in the heart part.

761
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:36,081
In the womb,

762
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:39,091
Blood has to bypass the lungs,

763
00:39:39,216 --> 00:39:40,502
Since they don't work yet.

764
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:43,630
When we're born,
we take our first big breath,

765
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:46,755
lungs expand, and the ductus closes.

766
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:48,548
Yours didn't.

767
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:53,149
She has a patent ductus arteriosis.

768
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:56,008
When you get stressed,

769
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:59,758
your blood pressure goes up
and forces open the ductus.

770
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,107
Blood takes a little detour,

771
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,261
makes it leak from your nose,
your stomach, your lungs,

772
00:40:06,115 --> 00:40:08,113
and, more significantly,
keeps it flowing

773
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:10,908
to the right side of your brain
and away from your left.

774
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:16,000
Which means that when you get
stressed, you get unstressed.

775
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:19,499
That's why you're so good
with those annoying kids.

776
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,667
And why, when your
blood pressure dropped,

777
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:26,089
you were able to identify Cuddy
as an annoying human being.

778
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,092
<i>Good news is,</i>

779
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:30,552
we can fix the heart.

780
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:34,580
Bad news for the annoying kids.

781
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,856
She's incredible.

782
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,068
Thank you.

783
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:47,652
Great work today.

784
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,004
I should've trusted your instincts.
I will in the future.

785
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:54,957
I quit.

786
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,204
I think I just apologized.

787
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:01,239
If you want,
I can get down on my knees.

788
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:02,919
It's not because of you.

789
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,052
I approved an insane procedure with

790
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:08,173
no proof, no evidence, no...

791
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:09,907
You made the right call.

792
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:12,984
The problem was a brain problem.

793
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:15,107
Without the procedure,
House never notices

794
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:17,022
the increased left-brain function.

795
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:19,591
She'd be dead if you hadn't said yes.
- I know.

796
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:21,154
But...

797
00:41:23,802 --> 00:41:26,024
I'll always say yes to House.

798
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:28,944
I studied under him.
He's in my head.

799
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,863
And if you gave anyone else this
job, they would always say no,

800
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,034
Because...

801
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:35,033
Well, because they should.

802
00:41:35,545 --> 00:41:36,931
House is insane.

803
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:40,604
Which leaves me.

804
00:41:43,995 --> 00:41:45,116
I'm sorry.

805
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:54,592
Hey, buddy!

806
00:41:57,153 --> 00:41:58,598
It's okay, buddy.
Come here.

807
00:41:58,788 --> 00:42:00,934
Oh, I missed you so much.

808
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,811
I missed you.

809
