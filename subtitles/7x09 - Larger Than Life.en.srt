00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:57,466
I don't know.

181
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:00,602
Things have been
a little tense around here

182
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,306
since that whole
online-boyfriend thing.

183
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:06,341
Phil's not my boyfriend.

184
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:07,709
I'm not the one
with the problem.

185
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,011
No, you're the one
with feelings for someone else.

186
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:14,750
You're still my husband.

187
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:18,987
I still love you.

188
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:24,426
And I want things
to be okay between us.

189
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,864
Also, you're
a famous model now.

190
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:30,432
That's pretty cool...

191
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,733
Sexy, even.

192
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:34,236


193
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:43,512


194
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:46,314
So I advance through
the carotid bifurcation...

195
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:47,249
<i></i>
<i>Are you asking?</i>

196
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,551
Yes, I'm asking.

197
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:51,253
I've only read
how to do it.

198
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,655
Practice is different
than theory.

199
00:08:53,723 --> 00:08:55,824
Just tell me how to do it.
<i>You're going to inject dye</i>

200
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:58,693
just past the takeoff
for the optic artery.

201
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,328
Right. Now?

202
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:02,030


203
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:03,231
His B.P.'s going up.

204
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,367
The procedure's
stressing his body.

205
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:07,035
Well, what do I do?

206
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:09,137
Hold on a minute.
Just give him a chance

207
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:10,772
to regain equilibrium.

208
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,974
B.P.'s up,
heart rate's 180.

209
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,242
<i>W-what should I do?</i>

210
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,678
Give me the catheter.
Get a crash cart.

211
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:18,180


212
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:19,548
He's in cardiac arrest.

213
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:23,752
Maybe your second time
will go better.

214
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,101
So we finally know
what Taub would look like

215
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:31,256
if he were life-size.

216
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:32,974
Can we go back
to the office now?

217
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:34,092
You kidding?

218
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,860
We got
a differential to run.

219
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:37,829
Cardiac arrhythmia.

220
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:39,764
That poster got me laid
when I got home last night,

221
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:41,633
so do your worst.

222
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,468
<i></i>
<i>Arrhythmia proves</i>
<i>I was right.</i>

223
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:46,404
Jack's problem is his heart,
not his brain.

224
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:47,672
So when you're not
on a billboard,

225
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,990
you sleep with nurses.

226
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:50,675
But when you are,
you sleep with your wife.

227
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:52,077
I think you got
that backwards.

228
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:53,845
That's my elbow
in the corner.

229
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:55,113
<i>What's your wife</i>
<i>doing later?</i>

230
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:57,916
Huh. They chose you
and cut out Chase?

231
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,684
Apparently,
marketing thinks my face

232
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:01,386
is the most trustworthy.

233
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:03,488
For real?

234
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:05,090
<i></i>
<i>Both of our patients'</i>
<i>cardiac incidents</i>

235
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:06,291
<i>happened</i>
<i>after physical stress.</i>

236
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,860
I'm guessing
vasovagal syncope?

237
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:10,762
Buzzkill.

238
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,681
<i></i>
<i>Vasovagal syncope would</i>
<i>manifest at a much younger age.</i>

239
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:14,766
Could be drugs.
Tox screen was clean.

240
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,335
What about autonomic
nervous system dysfunction?

241
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:19,104
<i>It could cause arrhythmia</i>
<i>and fainting.</i>

242
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:26,711
Inappropriate?

243
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,281
I mean,
'cause of the Jew thing?

244
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:32,450
Autonomic nervous system
dysfunction--

245
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:33,685
I like it.

246
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,453
<i>Let's biopsy</i>
<i>his pituitary gland.</i>

247
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,555
Adrenal venous sampling
makes more sense

248
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:39,591
and is a less
invasive procedure...

249
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:41,292
Which you don't
care about,

250
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,128
because you just want
to check the pituitary,

251
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:44,629
because you still think

252
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:46,564
there's something wrong
with the guy's brain?

253
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:48,333
Can't fool you.

254
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,418
He has no other symptoms
for pituitary disease.

255
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:52,070
We can't stick
a needle in his brain

256
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:53,571
because you don't believe
in heroism.

257
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,773
<i></i>
<i>Fine, do it your way.</i>

258
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,074
You'll waste half a day,

259
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:59,677
but I'm sure he's in no hurry
to get better.

260
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:01,079

The autonomic nervous system

261
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:03,615
controls involuntary actions,
like your heartbeat.

262
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:05,383
If we're right,
it's manageable,

263
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:06,618
but will progress.

264
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:09,220
Do you think we can consult
with him?

265
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:15,226
I didn't know
you knew Dr. Taub.

266
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:16,461

I don't.

267
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:19,531
You saw the ads.

268
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:21,399
Look, no offense,
but you were wrong yesterday.

269
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,101
And they wouldn't have made him
the face of the hospital

270
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:24,469
if he weren't
really good, right?

271
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:34,012


272
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,614
Dr. Taub...

273
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:38,933
The patient
would like to see you.

274
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:47,759
How can I help?

275
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:11,349


276
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,718
I forgot.
You guys talk.

277
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:16,421
Look, no offense
to either of you,

278
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:18,356
but dinner with your mom?

279
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:21,359
Come on, I-I'd have to act
like a decent human being,

280
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:23,228
and you know what a strain
that puts on me.

281
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:25,997
And, you, ever since
you broke up with Sam,

282
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:27,632
you've done nothing
but mope and whine.

283
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,701
It's an unbelievable bummer.

284
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:31,603
And just
what is so exciting

285
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,739
you have to blow off
both of us to do it?

286
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:39,310
I just want to sit
on my couch in my underwear,

287
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:40,778
drink scotch,

288
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:42,680
and watch <i>The Real Housewives</i>
<i>of New Jersey...</i>

289
00:12:42,748 --> 00:12:43,915
<i>By myself.</i>

290
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:45,850
I just want
one night off.

291
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:47,485
Is that so much to ask?

292
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:49,921
Yes.
Yes.

293
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,523
You have to choose
one of us.

294
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,926
I choose Wilson.

295
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:57,095
<i></i>
<i>Good...</i>

296
00:12:57,162 --> 00:13:00,164
Because he's coming
to my birthday dinner.

297
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:06,170
I do not whine.

298
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:16,114
Jack's not exactly
the hero type.

299
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:18,750
He started
this band in college.

300
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:20,184
They gig
around the country,

301
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:21,886
looking
for their big break.

302
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:24,088
It's been 16 years.

303
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:25,790
That must be hard
on you and Daisy.

304
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,560
It's like
I'm a single parent.

305
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:35,900
I love him so much.

306
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,338
But I'm at the end
of my rope.

307
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:45,577
What Jack did yesterday
was so incredible,

308
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:47,545
our boss
assumed his illness

309
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:50,081
had something to do
with his behavior.

310
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:52,917
But if that's
not the case,

311
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:56,454
there's more to him
than you think.

312
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:03,595
<i></i>
<i>You think Taub</i>
<i>really comes across</i>

313
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:05,396
as the most
trustworthy doctor here?

314
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:08,933

I knew it was bugging you.

315
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:12,036
They cut me out.
You're a pretty boy.

316
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:14,839
Works well with the ladies,
not so much with the patients.

317
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:17,208
No one wants an underwear model
performing their splenectomy.

318
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:19,177
Well, I notice they weren't
exactly knocking down your door

319
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:20,645
looking
for Dr. Trustworthy.

320
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:23,047
That's 'cause I'm black.

321
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:25,883
Cortisol levels look normal.
We were wrong.

322
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:27,619
Which House will interpret
as him being right.

323
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:30,955
<i>He's gonna make us biopsy</i>
<i>the pituitary gland.</i>

324
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:36,961
<i></i>
<i>You seem pretty calm</i>
<i>for a guy</i>

325
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,947
who's surrounded
by racists.

326
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:41,799
80% of the Princeton
population is white.

327
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,368
Some are racist.
Some aren't.

328
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:44,769
White works
with both demographics.

329
00:14:44,837 --> 00:14:46,904
So race is your excuse,

330
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:48,206
not the fact
that you usually look

331
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,742
like you're about
to punch someone in the face?

332

<i>We're good.</i>

333

He's not breathing.
Suction.

335
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:01,753

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,890

Sats are coming back.

338
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,661
Mucus plug.

339
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:11,062
That's weird.

<i></i>
<i>Fluid in the lungs.</i>

341
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:18,202
Pneumonitis?

342
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,871
That doesn't fit
with anyone's theory.

343
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,084
Our tests finally
rule out the brain.

344
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:28,519
That leaves the heart
and the lungs.

345
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,254
Pneumonitis can be caused
by bacteria,

346
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:32,557
parasite, some kind
of an obstruction.

347
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:34,225
Who was the girl
on the tracks?

348
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:37,028
News story said her name
was Chloe Jeffries.

349
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:38,563
Why does that matter?

350
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,098
'Cause there's another reason
besides being sick

351
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:41,899
that he'd risk his life
for a stranger.

352
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:45,002
She's not a stranger.

353
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,205
The damsel in distress
is an epileptic.

354
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:48,940
So we assumed she was having
an epileptic seizure,

355
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:50,675
but what if she wasn't?

356
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,910
What if she's sick too?
<i></i> <i>Jack is away a lot</i>

357
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:54,512
on tour.

358
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,147
<i>What happens on the road</i>
<i>stays on the road.</i>

359
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:57,849
The most likely cause
of pneumonitis is infection.

360
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,917
Shouldn't we be getting
a sputum culture?

361
00:15:59,985 --> 00:16:01,352
There's no
significant elevation

362
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,487
of white
blood cell count.

363
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:03,855
This is more
like toxic exposure.

364
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,123
<i></i>
<i>He's got a point.</i>

365
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,091
Why is your assumption
of his guilt more valid

366
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,994
than my assumption
of his selflessness?

367
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:11,412
Because my assumption
is backed up

368
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:14,031
by millions of men,
and Taub,

369
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,667
who've cheated
on their wives.

370
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:19,303
Find the girl
and the love nest.

371
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,739
Every hero
has his Kryptonite.

372
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:25,443
Hello?

373
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:26,944
So we're breaking
into this girl's apartment

374
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,446
because House thinks
that two people,

375
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:30,448
standing 30 feet apart
on a subway platform

376
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:31,816
have to be lovers.

377
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:33,785
God, you're a drag today.

378
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:36,254
Let me guess.
Back to fighting with the wife?

379
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,623
No. We had sex
again last night...

380
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,657
Twice...

381
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:41,392
And again this morning.

382
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,960
Aw.

383
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:47,431
Rachel hasn't wanted
this much intimacy

384
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:49,634
in a long time.

385
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:51,235
I don't think it's me
she's hot for.

386
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,304
It's this Internet guy.

387
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:55,673
She's just happy,

388
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,542
and that's
turning her on.

389
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:59,577
<i>So she's</i>
<i>not cheating on you,</i>

390
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,612
<i>and you're getting</i>
<i>all the action you can handle.</i>

391
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,048
<i>I don't see the downside.</i>

392
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:07,819
What was Jack's band called?

393
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:10,354
Suicide...Something.

394
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:11,839
Suicide season.

395
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:13,357
She does know him.

396
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:15,526
Question is,
how'd they get sick?

397
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:18,696
Kryptonite.

398
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,569
EKG's unremarkable,

399
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:27,205
thyroid, liver, and
kidney function seems fine.

400
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:28,372
You're perfectly healthy.

401
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,975
I wish that you
would take a second look.

402
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:32,710
I'm tired all the time,

403
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:34,078
and when it's cold,

404
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:35,980
<i>i get this weird pain</i>
<i>in my shoulder.</i>

405
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:37,648
I have a pain in my leg.

406
00:17:37,716 --> 00:17:39,417
You don't hear me
complaining...

407
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:41,619
Except for just now.

408
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:44,422
How do doctors
get this idea

409
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,958
you're better
than everyone else?

410
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,360
Probably
all that pulling people

411
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:51,295
back from the brink
of death.

412
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,331
It's just a guess.

413
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:55,666
My own daughter
is a doctor.

414
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:58,769
She makes a hobby
of dismissing my concerns.

415
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:00,037
She sounds smart.

416
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:02,640
Did she tell you
to say that?

417
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,909

I've never met your daughter.

418
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:06,944
That's hard to believe

419
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:09,547
since you're currently
<i>shtupping</i> her.

420
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:32,837
We have a situation.

421
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:36,207
- Roach bombs, where?
- In Chloe's apartment.

422
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:38,776
Who's Chloe?

423
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:40,211
Uh, look,

424
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,479
we don't care
about your personal life.

425
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:42,847
We're not gonna
tell your wife.

426
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,233
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

427
00:18:46,652 --> 00:18:49,186
Guess who showed up
looking for Jack.

428
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:50,755
Hey.

429
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:52,023
Hi.

430
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,257
<i></i>
<i>You okay?</i>

431
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:54,859
The E.M.T. said you'd gone
to another hospital.

432
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,928
They help me overnight
for observation. I'm fine.

433
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,763
I had to come here to...

434
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,101
I don't know
why you did it,

435
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,037
but thank you.

436
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:09,140
You're welcome.

437
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:14,845
<i>I should have brought flowers</i>
<i>or something.</i>

438
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:16,347
You're like
my guardian angel.

439
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:18,983
No. I'm just a guy
in a band.

440
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:20,134
<i></i>
<i>Maybe you've</i>
<i>heard of them?</i>

441
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:22,153
Suicide season?

442
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,221
One of my nurses
gave me the CD.

443
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,023
<i>I haven't had a chance</i>
<i>to listen to it yet,</i>

444
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:27,758
but I have a feeling

445
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:29,810
I'm going to be
your biggest fan.

446
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:33,431

I'm gonna need you
to cough.

447
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:34,498
What are you doing?

448
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,067
Getting a sputum culture.

449
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,069
They obviously
don't know each other,

450
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,403
<i>so it's not</i>
<i>toxic exposure.</i>

451
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,873
Just leaves my theory--
infection.

452
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:44,608
If you could just cough
up a sample,

453
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:46,811
we can, uh, test
for pathogens.

454
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:48,012
Um...

455
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,747


456
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,315
Sorry, um...
Sorry, nothing--

457
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:52,883
there's nothing
coming up.

458
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:53,918
Well, maybe I can
help you.

459
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,052


460
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,187
Aah!

461
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:58,222
Ohh! It hurts!

462
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,423
<i></i>
<i>What's the matter?</i>

463
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,659


464
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,928
Round, equal,
reactive to light.

465
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,329
It's not a stroke.

Even you have

Yes, but that doesn't
make him a hero.

476

It makes him
an idiot.

477
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,731
The only reason
that headline doesn't say

478
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:36,799
"moron crushed by train"

"moron goes undiagnosed

<i>Ear pain fits</i>
<i>with my theory.</i>

483
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,843
Jack has an infection

But let me know when
they come back negative,

490
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:57,086

491
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:58,321
You have
a better idea?

492
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:00,189
Nope, so I'm gonna pick one
at random.

493
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:01,724
Acoustic neuroma.

494
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,459
<i></i>
<i>A tumor in the ear--</i>
<i>makes sense.</i>

495

And if it's putting pressure

496
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:07,230
on the breathing centers in
his brain, explains the lungs.

497
00:21:07,297 --> 00:21:08,464
The lungs
explain the heart.

00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:09,632


499
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,502

potential test.

You guys got this?

502
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:23,579
I have been going
out of my way

503
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:26,215
to be nice to old Jewish ladies
for months now

504
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:28,551
on the off chance
one of them could be your mom.

505
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,353
You couldn't have mentioned
she's a shiksa?

506
00:21:32,156 --> 00:21:34,057
She converted
when she mared my dad.

507
00:21:34,124 --> 00:21:35,491
You see,
now is too late.

508
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,126
<i>I'm not blaming</i>
<i>you for this.</i>

509
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:39,429
She's the one who ambushed you
to find out what you were like,

510
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,464
because I "never
tell her anything."

511
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:43,299
I'd have to agree
with her on that one.

512
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:46,102
Anyway, I obviously
can't come to dinner now.

513
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,603
Obviously?

514
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:50,039
Well, she's crazy,
and she hates me.

<i>House...</i>

516
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:54,844
I need you to come
to that dinner for two hours,

keep your mouth shut,

518
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:59,882
Yes, you will be in hell,

519
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,752

having you there.

520
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,421
That is
what a relationship is.

We average our misery.

522
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:13,830
That was...

523
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:16,132
Unexpected.

I'm having a good day.

525
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:20,369
I finally resolved
that thing with my sister.

526
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:21,771
What thing?

527
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,206
Oh, we had
the worst fight

528
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:25,174
over whether it's time
to put dad in that facility.

529
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:26,876
Been sick over it
for weeks.

530
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:30,113
You never mentioned
anything about your sister.

531
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,116

six hours longer.

885
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,573
Autopsy works too.

886
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,542
Fyi, turns out
your hero is a loser.

887
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,977
He's going
back on the road.

888
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,946
He still risked his life
for that woman.

889
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,748
That was impulse.
That was easy.

890
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,783
Dealing with family
is hard.

891
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,086
Wait, that's another thing
I got right.

892
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,488
How many does that make?

893
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,459
And how many for you?

894
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,763
I'm also kicking your ass
at gloating.

00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,570
Hi.

897
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,442
I think we should get
a divorce.

898
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,216
You have feelings for him,
and I can't handle that.

899
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,421
But it's my fault

900
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,423
you needed someone else.

901
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,160
I keep hurting you.
We love each other.

902
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,528
I know.

903
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:35,064
But are you happy?

904
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,736
No.

905
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,407
Then what are we doing?

906
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,286

You know, you turned out
remarkably close to normal,

907
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,521
considering
the genes in play.

908
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:59,622
Thanks.

909
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,457
Here...

910
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,226
In case
your mom comes back.

911
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,895
Happy Birthday.

Yes.

Oh, no, I can't.

00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,379
It's, uh, bowling night.

919
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,816
He'll never forgive me
if I don't.

920
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,985
Oh, screw it.
I'm coming.

921
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:32,455
No, no, no. I am not gonna
be responsible for that.

922
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,058
You drugged the man.
You go bowling with him.

924
