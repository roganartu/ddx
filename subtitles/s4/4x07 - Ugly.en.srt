1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:03,596
<i>We just arrived.</i>

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,467
<i>Yeah. Kids okay on your end?</i>

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,041
<i>Good.</i>

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,577
<i>Yeah, yeah. He's very excited.</i>

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,477
<i>Hey, hey. Listen, I gotta go,
okay? I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

6
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,741
<i>Excuse me.</i>

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,980
<i>Get away. Get away.</i>

8
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,250
<i>Sorry about that. Sorry.</i>

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,351
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,596
Excuse us.

11
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,632
<i>I ought to go back and kick
the hell out of that guy.</i>

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,600
She was old enough, she didn't
have to scream like that.

13
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,863
It's okay, Dad. It didn't bother me.

14
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,462
<i>For the first time, none
of these people bother me.</i>

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,599
<i>I just think, "36 more hours. "</i>

16
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,802
Thirty-six more hours? How
do you figure that, Kenny?

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,971
<i>Tomorrow at this time,
I'm scheduled for surgery.</i>

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,483
<i>It's a 10-hour procedure,
throw two in there for prep,</i>

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,542
<i>thirty-six until I'm just
another face in the crowd.</i>

20
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:31,513
<i>Kenny has a frontonasal encephalocele.
It's a midline deformity.</i>

21
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,889
<i>He's here to undergo
a facial bipartition.</i>

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,359
And what does that mean?

23
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,726
Well, we have five
surgeons, four nurses.

24
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,458
<i>He's going to require
six units of blood.</i>

25
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,863
<i>Will it fix him?</i>

26
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,629
It'll repair a lot of the damage done...

27
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,726
We need a sound byte.

28
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,670
Would you say, "He'll be
ready for the junior prom"?

29
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,538
<i>Yeah, yeah. That's probably true.</i>

30
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,577
No, I mean, I need you to say it.

31
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:52,736
<i>Dr. Chase,</i>

32
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,245
we got an issue.

33
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,205
Heart rate's skyrocketing,
he's over 180.

34
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,807
He's in v-fib. Paddles!

35
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,011
<i>Charge to 300.</i>

36
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,212
Turn that camera off.

37
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,754
Is this a reaction to anesthesia?

38
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,017
Haven't given it yet.

39
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,383
Clear!

40
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,892
Crank it to 360.

41
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,253
<i>I said turn that damn camera off! Clear!</i>

42
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,863
<i>A teenage boy with a cranial facial
deformity was about to undergo</i>

43
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:54,664
<i>a reconstructive procedure, when he
had an unexplained cardiac arrest.</i>

44
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,969
<i>Good.</i>

45
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,337
<i>Good?</i>

46
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,870
<i>I mean, go on.</i>

47
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,507
<i>We have the patient on a pacing wire,</i>

48
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,315
<i>it's the only thing
keeping his heart going.</i>

49
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,788
<i>Yeah, we know. We're doctors.</i>

50
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,790
<i>Right, it was meant to be just for them.</i>

51
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,724
Just be yourself.

52
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:19,856
<i>Until we are able to figure out
exactly what is causing the heart block,</i>

53
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,300
<i>the reconstructive surgery
is on hold, obviously.</i>

54
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,799
<i>That's "yourself"?</i>

55
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,468
<i>Fascinating case.</i>

56
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,033
<i>I will see you again after
I have saved his life.</i>

57
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,272
<i>Have a warm bath waiting.</i>

58
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,775
<i>Are you following me?</i>

59
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,411
<i>Darnell will be trailing
you throughout the case.</i>

60
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,353
<i>Pretend we're not here.</i>

61
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,982
<i>But if I do that, won't I bump into you?</i>

62
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,220
<i>We'll stay out of your way.</i>

63
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,193
<i>No, it was a joke.</i>

64
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,562
<i>See, I became a doctor because
of the movie, Patch Adams.</i>

65
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,528
<i>Listen, do you wanna get
ahead of me and maybe back up,</i>

66
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,334
<i>I don't know, low down,
so I look more powerful?</i>

67
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,100
That's perfect. Yeah?

68
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,735
Also, my eyes look better
in rooms with summer colors.

69
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,575
You know what? It's black and white...

70
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,743
You think I like the cameras?

71
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,914
You think I want the whole world
watching you check out my ass

72
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,014
and question my wardrobe?

73
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,922
Would it be better if I checked out
your wardrobe and questioned your ass?

74
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,291
A little part of me...

75
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,624
There is no little part of you.

76
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,893
...thought that maybe you would see

77
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,127
what great PR this
could be for the hospital

78
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,968
and not make me force you
to act like a human being.

79
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,803
You using force on me is intriguing.

80
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,967
On the other hand,
cameras make people act.

81
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,240
Sometimes like human
beings, sometimes just weird,

82
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,874
sometimes they wear open-tip bras.

83
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,208
It's cold in here.

84
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:51,819
A less obvious point is that I need my team
to be unafraid of the metaphorical fart.

85
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,792
That production company is covering
all the medical costs for this kid.

86
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,887
So either you let them continue filming

87
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,932
or the kid goes home with the same face.

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,374
<i>Sorry about that. Private.</i>

89
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,372
<i>She waxes her moustache once a month</i>

90
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,678
<i>and sometimes gets some
pretty gnarly ingrown hairs.</i>

91
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,452
So, did he hire you flat out or are
you competing for one of the spots?

92
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,053
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

93
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,723
She's not competing.

94
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,963
She was handpicked by House.
She's safe, like Foreman.

95
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,937
So that takes three spots down to one.

96
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,008
Where's Foreman?

97
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,569
He's in the bathroom. Good.

98
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,013
Come on. Let's go for a walk.

99
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,910
<i>Walks look good on camera.</i>

100
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,511
<i>They give the illusion of
the story moving forward.</i>

101
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,620
<i>New patient.</i>

102
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,292
Sixteen-year-old boy with
second-degree infranodal heart block.

103
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,426
<i>Post-arrest.</i>

104
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,595
Any reports of
light-headedness or syncope?

105
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,865
<i>Certainly not light-headedness.</i>

106
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,270
<i>Why did you hire her?</i>

107
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,500
<i>Not in front of the company.</i>

108
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,906
<i>Are we gonna be on TV?</i>

109
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,273
<i>I'm making a music video.</i>

110
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,107
<i>Come on. A little faster, more energy.</i>

111
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,908
<i>Why are you glad Foreman's not here?</i>

112
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,779
<i>Because he would object
to what I'm about to do.</i>

113
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,011
<i>Oh!</i>

114
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,717
<i>Sorry.</i>

115
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,660
Hey, buddy.

116
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,829
You stay in there, we'll be out here,
making sure he doesn't move again.

117
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,492
God! Finally I hear myself think.

118
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:42,892
Our patient has...

119
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,493
Why did you hire her?

120
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,668
Because she has way more
diagnostic experience

121
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,266
than the other swimsuit
models I was considering.

122
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:55,576
Our patient has a frontonasal
encephalocele with a midline cleft.

123
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,746
Don't stare directly at it.

124
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,117
So what caused "Big
Head's" heart to stop?

125
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,952
Simple. His big head.

126
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,287
Increased intacranial pressure
would cause heart block.

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,296
Wrong. Sixteen years they've been
testing that insane noggin to death.

128
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,797
What about a congenital heart defect?

129
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,390
He has a midline anomaly on his head,

130
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,904
makes sense he'd have a midline
anomaly in his heart, too.

131
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,962
The 16 years of testing didn't show?

132
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,304
Why did you bring her in
so late? It's not fair.

133
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,207
The rest of us... Hey,
hey, hey! You wanted fair,

134
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,712
you picked the wrong
job, the wrong profession,

135
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,145
the wrong species.

136
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,239
Forget the deformity.

137
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,080
Treat the patient like he's any
other really, really ugly kid.

138
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,143
Infection? Could be endocarditis.

139
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,382
Well, since he doesn't have
a prosthetic heart valve,

140
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,687
I assume you're thinking
he's an IV drug user?

141
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,987
House said assume he's normal.

142
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,255
Dealers don't ask for ID and
don't care what you look like.

143
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,263
Nice. You're right about the habit.

144
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,798
You're wrong about the substance.

145
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,393
Blackened skin under the nose
equals frostbite from huffing Freon.

146
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,267
Freon's toxic, it damages the heart.

147
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,738
Discoloration could be
acanthosis nigricans.

148
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,707
It's a common side effect
of these deformities.

149
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,142
There's also discoloration
on the cheeks and forehead.

150
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,406
Do a nuclear study.

151
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,813
If I'm right, you'll see
scarring of the heart.

152
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,849
I'm not part of some game, am I?

153
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,689
I gave up a career because I
thought this was a firm offer.

154
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,990
Yes, this is a real offer.

155
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,237
I think she might be an idiot.

156
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,328
Who?

157
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,737
No, she can't be an idiot.

158
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,901
I mean, she was in the
CIA, for God's sake.

159
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,411
And the Bay of Pigs
was a daring triumph.

160
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,413
She had good ideas in Langley.

161
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,641
All your ideas.

162
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,184
She was able to identify
that they were good ideas.

163
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,719
Stab in the dark here, is she pretty?

164
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,844
She's new.

165
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,320
She's nervous. She's a C-cup.

166
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,152
She said one dumb
thing in a differential.

167
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,919
They all say dumb
things in differentials.

168
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,187
A D-cup?

169
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,626
If she's no good, just fire her.

170
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,664
I can't. I just hired her.

171
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,396
She left a career.

172
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,933
Wow.

173
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,939
Either that's actual guilt, or
I have got to see this woman.

174
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,541
<i>My son is not huffing Freon.</i>

175
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:10,981
<i>Mr. Arnold, Dr. House is like a
savant when it comes to diagnostics.</i>

176
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,414
<i>What's his genius theory?</i>

177
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:17,217
<i>Because Kenny's not normal, he's
doing drugs to deal with his pain?</i>

178
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,226
<i>Maybe the way to look at
this is that you are normal.</i>

179
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,087
<i>And what's that supposed to mean?</i>

180
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:28,623
<i>You're like any other parent who
thinks his kid can't be doing drugs.</i>

181
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,434
<i>Doing this because my
dad thinks I'm on drugs?</i>

182
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,568
I was doing drugs behind my
parent's back at your age,

183
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,169
and I had a lot less reason to be.

184
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,244
Not that your life must be miserable.

185
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,683
Not that I'm suggesting that
you should be doing drugs.

186
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,415
<i>How's school going? I'm home schooled.</i>

187
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,753
Really? You're lucky.

188
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,584
Going to school was boring.

189
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,220
My dad took me out, and it
wasn't because it was boring.

190
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,287
I had a rough time in school, too.

191
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:03,495
Maybe not like you, but, you know...
I don't mean to compare our situations.

192
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,204
Actually, I guess I am
comparing our situations,

193
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,867
but only to show you how yours is worse.

194
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,209
<i>You can edit that out, right,
so I don't look like an idiot?</i>

195
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,373
Relax. Everyone acts
like an idiot around me.

196
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,014
Makes you think it's not an act.

197
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,483
Can I have something for my headache?

198
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,577
Yeah, is that new?

199
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,121
Sixteen years old.

200
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,350
Has the same birthday I do.

201
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,493
I'm gonna start the test now.

202
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,229
Study showed no signs of
scarring on Kenny's heart.

203
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,321
It wasn't drugs.

204
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,558
Well, then, give me something better.

205
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,622
What's causing heart block?

206
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,292
It could be toxoplasmosis.

207
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,836
We should do an LP
to test for infection.

208
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,463
If it was toxoplasmosis, we'd
have seen enlarged lymphs,

209
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,599
and because you're not pretty enough to
be an idiot, you must know that already,

210
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,405
which means you just said it
because you want to do an LP

211
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,570
to look for intracranial pressure.

212
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,170
Because it is intracranial pressure.

213
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,544
Wait, I'm not done.

214
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,775
You thought I wouldn't catch on,

215
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,080
which means you either think I'm
an idiot, which is flattering,

216
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,619
I've been doing my hair differently...

217
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,155
The kid's got headaches. He's been
popping acetaminophen like peanuts.

218
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,747
How could you possibly
think that I was done?

219
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,917
I prefaced that with an
"either. " It needs an "or. "

220
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,018
Or, you are an idiot,

221
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,565
which is possible, I'm not
great at judging men's looks.

222
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,090
<i>The OR?</i>

223
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,896
<i>And the MRI room.</i>

224
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,565
<i>Yes...</i>

225
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,706
<i>Dr. House frequently conducts differential
diagnoses in a variety of places.</i>

226
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,911
<i>He feels that a change in venue</i>

227
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,973
<i>often leads to a change
in thinking processes.</i>

228
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,152
<i>I have to go take
care of something else.</i>

229
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,020
Just let me do a CT
scan, see if I'm right.

230
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,184
The sooner we fix the problem,

231
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,353
the sooner we can get to
his reconstructive surgery.

232
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,091
Yeah. Who cares if you're
dead? It's how you look.

233
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,497
Well, since you've given me
nothing better, we're back to drugs.

234
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,660
The one thing we know it's not.

235
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,829
Decreased uptake on
the membranous septum.

236
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,532
Could be an artifact.
We can redo it, but...

237
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,268
Nothing's nothing. Do an EP study.

238
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,542
EP study means we have
to stop this kid's heart.

239
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,509
I'll set it up.

240
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,410
<i>House, do you have a
minute to be disemboweled?</i>

241
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,283
<i>I'm gonna thread this catheter
through different areas in your heart,</i>

242
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,456
<i>and once I've found the right pathway,
I'll apply some electrical energy.</i>

243
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,290
It'll stop my heart?

244
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,664
It sounds worse than
it is. You'll be fine.

245
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,725
Is it gonna hurt?

246
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,634
There'll be some discomfort.

247
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,006
If you've done drugs, I understand.

248
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,579
Being different's really hard.

249
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,888
Kenny, it's more important
for you to get better

250
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,789
than to worry about getting in trouble.

251
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,491
If I did drugs, that could
explain my heart problem?

252
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,892
It could.

253
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,988
And then you could do the
surgery to fix my face?

254
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,090
<i>That's why we're here.</i>

255
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,768
<i>You know how famous people,</i>

256
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,901
<i>everywhere they go people
are watching them, staring?</i>

257
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,574
<i>They never have a chance to just be,</i>

258
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,781
<i>you know? And a lot
of them turn to drugs.</i>

259
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,287
<i>And people stare at them because they're
beautiful, but, me they just stare...</i>

260
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,155
You okay?

261
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,120
I need to know what kind of
drugs, Kenny, and how much.

262
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,594
Coke, mostly. A lot of coke.

263
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:24,762
And then when I run out, I
usually go to LSD or acid.

264
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,133
Those are the same thing.

265
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,640
They are?

266
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,209
You don't do drugs, do you?

267
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,642
I drank from my dad's
liquor cabinet one time...

268
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,872
We're not gonna do this test. No...

269
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,642
I need you to turn on your side.

270
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,015
We need to intubate. I
need some help in here!

271
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,284
Too bad you guys are going
for a theatrical release.

272
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,989
Vomiting blood would
have made a great act-out.

273
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,122
Likely causes?

274
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,223
Mallory-Weiss tear.

275
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,767
No pallor, no melena.

276
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,564
Why are you wearing a tie?

277
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,467
<i>I always wear ties, I'm a doctor.</i>

278
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,938
<i>Please don't look at the camera.</i>

279
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,338
<i>Sorry.</i>

280
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,068
<i>Nasal papilloma.</i>

281
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,736
<i>Hemorrhage could have
overwhelmed the heart.</i>

282
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:07,870
<i>Nice lipstick.</i>

283
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,039
<i>Thank you.</i>

284
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,479
<i>Bad idea.</i>

285
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,310
The hemorrhage came after the block.

286
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,716
House, let them do their job.

287
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,079
Is anybody here more
interested in the medicine,

288
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,090
a little less interested
in the paparazzi?

289
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,318
Upper GI bleed.

290
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:24,192
Could be something he ate or
drank. Maybe a peptic ulcer.

291
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,891
Good.

292
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,331
Except no abdominal pain,
patient hasn't lost his appetite

293
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,895
and the last I checked, the gastrointestinal
tract isn't connected to the heart.

294
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,940
Yeah, but other than that, real good.

295
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,374
Nasopharyngeal angiofibrosis.

296
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,445
I just said it wasn't a nasal tumor.

297
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,446
Stomach cancer. Tumor causes bleeding,

298
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,982
body's reaction to the tumor
causes paraneoplastic syndrome,

299
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,176
which leads to heart block.

300
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,244
Finally, someone who is
not just a pretty face.

301
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,153
You and Taub, run the
scope, find the tumor.

302
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,658
Could be dangerous. If the
bleeding was caused by liver failure

303
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,126
as a result of the
intracranial pressure...

304
00:14:56,195 --> 00:15:00,529
Liver is the one organ you can't
ascribe to intracranial pressure.

305
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,931
<i>True.</i>

306
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,805
Intracranial pressure
can cause liver problems.

307
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,846
It causes an increase in the cavernous
sinus pressure, which causes pressure

308
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,111
in the superior vena cava,
which shuts down the liver.

309
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,082
Did you just think of that? No.

310
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,311
Then why didn't you say anything in...

311
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,617
Think it would've changed
his mind? Not a chance.

312
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,122
House would have undercut me,

313
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,987
and forced me to do a
procedure I just argued against,

314
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,994
and then I'd look like a hypocrite
in front of the thousands of people

315
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,326
and potential future
employers watching this film.

316
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,858
If you're right, and we stick a scope
back down a kid with liver failure,

317
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,699
he could bleed again.

318
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,033
I know.

319
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,335
He just vomited blood.

320
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,712
<i>Isn't that dangerous?</i>

321
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,713
<i>No. You're in good hands.</i>

322
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,417
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

323
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,462
Well, it's great how he
rebounded from that setback.

324
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,588
<i>What setback?</i>

325
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,133
<i>He didn't tell you about the...</i>

326
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,963
<i>Well, that's his right.</i>

327
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,901
<i>The records were sealed.</i>

328
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,530
<i>Personally, I think he
was just tapping his foot</i>

329
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,369
<i>and reaching for the toilet paper.</i>

330
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,774
<i>Obviously it was a witch hunt.</i>

331
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,579
<i>You think they singled
him out because...</i>

332
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,980
<i>No. Literally, a witch hunt.
Dr. House is a practicing Wiccan.</i>

333
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,881
<i>It's a beautiful
religion, it's very caring.</i>

334
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,285
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.</i>

335
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,517
You have an all-access pass to
the case, not my Fave 5s. Now, go.

336
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,160
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

337
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,995
I think I'm going blind.

338
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,161
Hairy palms, too?

339
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,967
She said something idiotic again
and I didn't even notice it.

340
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,099
Foreman had to point
out that it was idiotic.

341
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,370
She's making me an idiot.

342
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,877
It's cute. You have a crush.

343
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,573
No, I think it's something systemic.

344
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,114
Thirteen's pretty.

345
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,513
You're obviously okay with her.

346
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,949
She killed a patient.

347
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,111
The bitch is pretty.

348
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,244
The bitch is a bitch.

349
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,481
Ask her out.

350
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,852
The bitch? She's a bitch.

351
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,618
No, the one that's making you an idiot.

352
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,785
It's the story of life. Boy
meets girl. Boy gets stupid.

353
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,453
Boy and girl live stupidly ever after.

354
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,230
Pretty girl kill again? No.

355
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,291
Elephant boy just
vomiting up blood again.

356
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,740
No tumors in the
patient's stomach, so...

357
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,276
But the scope caused variceal bleeding.

358
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,369
Took 20 minutes of banding to stop it.

359
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,743
Taub was right about the liver failure.

360
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,008
Yeah.

361
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,880
His craniofacial deformity is
causing intracranial pressure...

362
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,009
No. ... which is causing...

363
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,953
Where are the nosebleeds?
Where's the labored breathing?

364
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,319
You were right about me being wrong.

365
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,687
You were wrong about you being right.

366
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,090
I need new ideas. Anybody?

367
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,535
Does it bother you that
this kid's gonna die

368
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,099
because you won't put down
that camera at all? You know?

369
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,770
Your people should be extra motivated.

370
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,108
I'm sure they all wanna
look good in the film.

371
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,706
<i>No, 'cause now they're too
worried about looking bad.</i>

372
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,947
Dr. House, heart block plus liver
failure could mean autoimmune.

373
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,818
Maybe scleroderma.

374
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,358
Foreman? Does that make sense?

375
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,087
Not without tight skin on the hands,

376
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,221
muscle weakness and
a 30-year-old patient.

377
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:23,631
Liver failure plus heart block
could be a mitochondrial disorder.

378
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,904
Hey, say what she just said.

379
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:32,170
Liver failure plus heart block
could be a mitochondrial disorder?

380
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,139
Go look for signs of
retinal degeneration.

381
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,739
No, it's ICP. You're
only gonna see swelling.

382
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,411
Take him with you, so he can
see the degeneration, too.

383
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,123
<i>So before you worked here in the
ER, you worked for House, right?</i>

384
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,249
<i>Three and a half years.</i>

385
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,418
<i>Why did you leave?</i>

386
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,018
<i>Hey. I don't wanna be on TV.</i>

387
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,119
<i>I'm not signing a release.</i>

388
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,288
<i>We'll blur you out.</i>

389
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,229
<i>Take off your pants.</i>

390
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,394
<i>You gonna be able to use any
of this if I start swearing?</i>

391
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,961
Did House treat you as badly as
he treats his current fellows?

392
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,131
<i>Loaded question.</i>

393
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,070
<i>That's not even a word.</i>

394
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,678
Fork!

395
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,838
Very clever.

396
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,314
I learnt how to be a doctor from House.

397
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,748
<i>Or at least a doctor who learnt
how to be a doctor from House,</i>

398
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,279
<i>if that makes any sense.</i>

399
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,255
<i>And you left his team because
you couldn't stand him anymore?</i>

400
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,985
<i>No, no. I love Dr. House.</i>

401
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,456
Now, that's something we haven't heard.

402
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,860
<i>I mean...</i>

403
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,562
<i>What did you ask me again?</i>

404
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,361
<i>Why you left.</i>

405
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,666
<i>I loved being around him,</i>

406
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,264
<i>professionally.</i>

407
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,343
<i>You know, he was always stimulating.</i>

408
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,902
<i>Not in an erotic sense of the word.</i>

409
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,347
<i>Fork. They forked,
and then they spooned!</i>

410
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,217
<i>Lean forward, and place
your chin on the rest.</i>

411
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,157
<i>I can't reach it.</i>

412
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,451
Skooch in a little.

413
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,557
I'll take care of it.

414
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,395
Just like last time?

415
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,537
Maybe we should try this
the old-fashioned way.

416
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,308
Okay, look up to the ceiling
and try not to blink, okay?

417
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,883
<i>Okay, good. Now straight ahead.</i>

418
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,253
<i>There it is. Swelling, no degeneration.</i>

419
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,784
It's not mitochondrial.

420
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,591
Swelling proves there's
increased pressure in his brain.

421
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,722
Absolutely.

422
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,391
So, now we can schedule
the reconstruction?

423
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,866
Absolutely not.

424
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,527
Your test proved you wrong.

425
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,367
We found exactly what
I predicted we'd find.

426
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,498
Swelling means there's
increased pressure.

427
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,599
You get a gold Star
of David for proving,

428
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,041
yes, this kid has a big head

429
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,807
and big heads cause pressure.
Doesn't explain the liver.

430
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,245
Too much acetaminophen does.

431
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,148
JRA explains all of
it, including the liver.

432
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,584
One theory's better than
two. Treat with steroids.

433
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,350
If you're wrong, steroids are
gonna mess with his immune system,

434
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,891
<i>put off his surgery for months.</i>

435
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,396
<i>You really wanna lose this
argument in front of the camera?</i>

436
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,462
<i>I'll speak to the father.</i>

437
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,904
Dr. House believes that Kenny has JRA.

438
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,873
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

439
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,240
We need to start administering steroids.

440
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,905
<i>Will the steroids fix it?</i>

441
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,647
<i>I don't think he has JRA.</i>

442
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,952
I think Dr. House is wrong,

443
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,356
and that the steroid
treatment could be dangerous.

444
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,394
I think I can get House
thrown off the case,

445
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,431
and get Kenny the
facial surgery he needs.

446
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,963
The father refused steroids until
we're sure about the diagnosis.

447
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,371
I am sure.

448
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,907
It's JRA.

449
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,601
And why would he even doubt that,

450
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,647
unless a former fellow of
mine was chirping in his ear?

451
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,080
The decision was his. I
merely voiced my concern.

452
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,174
Why did you take this job?

453
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,445
He's got a bulging cyst.

454
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,817
Perfectly good plastic surgery
practice, lots of money.

455
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,287
Fluids aren't draining properly.

456
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,120
Temptation to come screw
with me just too much for you?

457
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,250
There's gotta be a better reason.

458
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,817
He needs surgery to drain it.

459
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,524
Oh, and I think I mentioned
this earlier. You're fired.

460
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,695
What you did was over the line. Get out.

461
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,200
But don't go anywhere.
You're not fired, yet.

462
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,013
No one is firing anyone
in the middle of this case.

463
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,279
Not while those cameras are here,

464
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:38,414
and not while Taub is the only
person that this father trusts.

465
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,283
Where are you going?

466
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,758
To do what I always
do in these situations.

467
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,658
Treat my patient behind his back.

468
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,196
That's one option.

469
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,925
Or you can do a CT
scan of the kid's head.

470
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,126
If there's no midline
shift, we know Taub's wrong

471
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,660
and you get your consent
to give the kid steroids.

472
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,603
Just a warning.

473
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,471
If we have to start getting consent
every time we do a procedure,

474
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,603
soon they'll be asking
for informed consent.

475
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,780
Didn't think you had
the guts to stage a coup.

476
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,847
Coup failed. I'm scheduled
for execution at dawn.

477
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,016
No, you're not.

478
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,320
No reprieve from the governor.

479
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,329
You're a test result away from
becoming House's front runner.

480
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,831
He doesn't care about what you said,
or what you did five minutes ago.

481
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,526
He just wants the next good idea.

482
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,968
Show me 20 percent
magnification of the forebrain.

483
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:31,742
I look at our patient, as soon as
I saw his face, I saw a regular kid.

484
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:36,138
One thing about being a plastic
surgeon, you don't see what is,

485
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,510
you see what could be.

486
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:42,519
Talk like that around House, doesn't
matter how many good ideas you come up with.

487
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,786
So,

488
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,916
tell me what you don't
like about yourself.

489
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,256
Gosh.

490
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,824
There's so many things.

491
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,828
Is Dr. Taub available? Because
he was very highly recommended.

492
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,800
Well, he's no longer practicing with us,

493
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,360
but I've taken over all his files,

494
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,531
so if you tell me what needs work...

495
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,868
Do you know why he left?

496
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,466
He had personal issues to deal
with, so if we could just...

497
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,375
My goodness. Is he okay?

498
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,038
Oh, yeah, he's fine. He's fine.

499
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,174
Because my friend had
his ears done by Dr. Taub.

500
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,151
Should he worry that they may pop back?

501
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,051
No, it wasn't a professional issue.

502
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,056
I'm sorry, I really
can't go into more detail.

503
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,388
Shall we discuss your needs?

504
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:25,952
You know that toe next to the big
toe? Mine's bigger than my big toe.

505
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,727
Is there any way to shorten
it? Or make my big toe bigger?

506
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,995
Like, a toe-gmentation?

507
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,537
Did he lie, cheat or steal?

508
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,005
You're not here for a
consultation, are you?

509
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,134
What gave me away?

510
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,702
Was it my obviously perfect feet?

511
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:49,813
Hi.

512
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,811
CT shows that...

513
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,948
Let's go.

514
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,923
<i>What are you two doing here?</i>

515
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,487
<i>Skipping three scenes.</i>

516
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,329
<i>CT's back. He's gonna say that
there's evidence of an anomaly,</i>

517
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,459
<i>I'm gonna say, he's wrong.</i>

518
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,164
<i>He's gonna go back to the
father and we'll all end up here.</i>

519
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,707
The defect is pushing on
the right frontal lobe.

520
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,207
This bend is a sign of herniation.

521
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,507
Or, it's a sign of
increased pressure from JRA.

522
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,675
<i>Dr. Taub would rather
distract you from the truth</i>

523
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,151
with sparkly things,
like four karat diamonds.

524
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,278
House.

525
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,720
Your partner said that you
left for personal reasons,

526
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,155
<i>but your wife said you lost a patient.</i>

527
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,852
<i>You son of a bitch,
you spoke to my wife?</i>

528
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,087
<i>See, that confused me.</i>

529
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,594
<i>Why would you give her a diamond</i>

530
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,255
<i>if you screwed somebody else over?</i>

531
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,526
<i>If you screwed her
over, I mean, I could...</i>

532
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,465
<i>Get that camera out of here!</i>

533
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,232
You say anything to her?

534
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,367
Just asked questions.

535
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:46,671
Get them out of here, too.

536
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,269
We're doctors.

537
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,785
I screwed around with a
nurse. It became a deal.

538
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,015
My partners found out and I resigned.

539
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,751
There. Happy?

540
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,394
If you could be a bit more
descriptive, I'd be happier.

541
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,760
Some people pop pain pills,

542
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,261
I cheat.

543
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,268
We all have our vices.

544
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,873
<i>Taub, I don't see it.
Stay away from the family.</i>

545
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,782
<i>House, start steroids and
stay away from his family.</i>

546
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,657
<i>Wow, you are ugly.</i>

547
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,657
<i>Wow, you're an ass.</i>

548
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,561
<i>I have a deformity.</i>

549
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,534
I know, that's why you're ugly.

550
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,762
But you're a lucky boy.

551
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,327
Anywhere else in the animal kingdom,

552
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,498
your parents would
have eaten you at birth.

553
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,838
Your son needs steroids.

554
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,104
Dr. Cuddy agrees.

555
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,440
Does Dr. Taub?

556
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:59,012
He's not a real doctor.
He's a plastic surgeon.

557
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,780
All he cares is that your
son looks good in his coffin.

558
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,185
So, I'm supposed to believe you?

559
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,483
The doctor who cares.

560
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,354
You shouldn't care if I care.

561
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,484
I don't trust you.

562
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,758
Because I don't think
the surgery's important?

563
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,759
You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.

564
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,929
You're willing to take chances to risk
his life for something he doesn't need?

565
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,495
I do need it.

566
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,871
<i>I can't have real relationships.</i>

567
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,210
<i>I can't even have a real conversation.</i>

568
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,215
<i>Not even with my dad.</i>

569
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,447
<i>Dad.</i>

570
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,954
<i>I know you love me.</i>

571
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,925
<i>But you don't treat me normal.</i>

572
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,589
<i>You're always protective.</i>

573
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,599
<i>The world can always go to hell.</i>

574
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,929
<i>But you never yell at me.</i>

575
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,564
<i>Even when I screw up.</i>

576
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,139
<i>I wanna be normal.</i>

577
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,249
Take your steroids, and you get to live.

578
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,283
Then you can do your surgery.

579
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,189
But it'll only change your face.

580
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,958
It won't change who your face made you.

581
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,192
We're gonna get caught.

582
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,600
Not on film.

583
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,696
All their camera equipment's in here.

584
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,536
Where did you get those keys?

585
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,473
Blue, the janitor.

586
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,105
What?

587
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,642
That's his name.

588
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,647
His name's Lou.

589
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,519
Owe him an apology.

590
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,049
Just watch 20 minutes of this stuff,

591
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,422
tell me if I'm out of my mind.

592
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,984
Finally, we have video evidence.

593
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,561
<i>Dr. House, heart block plus liver
failure could mean autoimmune.</i>

594
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,396
<i>Maybe scleroderma.</i>

595
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,402
<i>Foreman? Does that make sense?</i>

596
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,029
<i>Not without tight skin on the hands,</i>

597
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:04,337
<i>muscle weakness and
a 30-year-old patient.</i>

598
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,343
Can I see that again?

599
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,771
What did you miss? She
screwed up, I didn't...

600
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,542
No, just the part
where she leans forward.

601
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,516
I think you can see through her dress.

602
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,249
<i>Upper GI bleed.</i>

603
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,417
<i>Could be something he ate or
drank. Maybe a peptic ulcer.</i>

604
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,653
<i>Good.</i>

605
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,690
You thought that was a good idea?

606
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,129
What am I gonna do?

607
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,426
Just enjoy.

608
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,368
I'm gonna keep her around,
because she makes me an idiot?

609
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,133
Well, you're protected,
Foreman seems immune.

610
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,366
You think he's gay?

611
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,602
Did he become an idiot around Chase?

612
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,068
<i>I just said it's not a nasal...</i>

613
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,047
Wait a minute, rewind
that. Was that Thirteen?

614
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,150
Wow.

615
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,982
I can't believe I'm that guy.

616
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,749
Every guy is that guy.

617
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,120
I'm not every guy.

618
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,556
What is this? Semantics here?

619
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,651
Okay, all guys are that guy.

620
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,729
I'm not all guys!

621
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,191
Cameron was smart.

622
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,168
You know, I'm beginning to doubt that.

623
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,735
I wanted to clarify
something I said earlier.

624
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,235
"I love Dr. House,"

625
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,976
and then I qualified it,
which, after thinking about it,

626
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,781
I didn't really need to do.

627
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,652
I did love being around him.

628
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,751
I guess, I just wanted to qualify

629
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,858
what I qualified before.

630
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,733
I'm looking defensive, aren't I?

631
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:37,927
No, no. I think that's great.

632
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,867
Clears everything up.

633
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,368
It's no big deal, really...

634
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:55,617
There's a mass lesion in the left anterior
temporal lobe surrounded by oedema.

635
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,451
Did you just insult me in Pig Latin?

636
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,320
Dr. House, please.

637
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,453
Will you just take a look at this?

638
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,731
The defect is causing this
nodular shadow here, you see it?

639
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,902
You're right, I didn't see that before.

640
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,535
Come on, let's go.

641
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,242
Hey.

642
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,008
I know you think you're feeling
better, on account of feeling better,

643
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:28,416
but this trusted family doctor
thinks that he's found a mass lesion,

644
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,488
so if you could lie back down
and struggle to breathe...

645
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,818
Okay.

646
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,517
You were right.

647
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,320
I'm thrilled I'm wrong.

648
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,687
This is great, Kenny.

649
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,393
You're gonna get your surgery now.

650
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,664
First person I'm coming
back to see is you,

651
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,229
because compared to me,
you're gonna look like butt.

652
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,467
Hey!

653
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,739
What, no comeback?

654
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,978
Look at that.

655
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,173
What?

656
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,042
His little finger, it's twitching.

657
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,016
No, it's not.

658
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,680
Just give it a second.

659
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,580
There. And?

660
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,220
He's not better.

661
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,492
What's wrong?

662
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,156
My diagnosis.

663
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,494
I don't know what he has.

664
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,101
Cancel the surgery.

665
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,977
New symptom. Involuntary
muscle movement.

666
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,607
Twitching finger is a symptom?

667
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,209
The body doing something
it's not supposed to do

668
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,844
is the definition of a symptom.

669
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,583
Kid's about to have a life-changing
operation. He's nervous.

670
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:40,646
Or he's not.

671
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,851
Or you were right.

672
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,917
Kid got better when
we put him on steroids.

673
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,327
This is JRA and it's under control now.

674
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,763
Or the steroids have just
tempered his condition.

675
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,892
He got a haircut, but
he's still got bad hair.

676
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,061
What about Lyme disease?

677
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,196
It explains everything, the heart
issues, the internal bleeding,

678
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,638
even why he'd get better on steroids.

679
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,268
On the other hand, if
he has Lyme disease,

680
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,677
there'd be other subtle clues
like a huge target-shaped rash.

681
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,872
But thanks for playing.

682
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,280
Why can't you just accept the
fact that you cured this kid?

683
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,649
You want to stop his surgery!

684
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,677
You're not normal.

685
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,915
<i>So you don't want
anyone else to be normal.</i>

686
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,221
<i>You don't think normal's healthy.</i>

687
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,393
Could be rheumatic fever.

688
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,163
Also explains why the steroids helped.

689
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,601
It's a similar inflammatory disease.

690
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,639
Rheumatic fever doesn't
explain liver failure.

691
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,503
Taub thinks that acetaminophen does.

692
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,167
Fine. Let's test your theory.

693
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,505
Remove his pacing wire.

694
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,910
<i>If he's better, his heart
will be just fine on its own</i>

695
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,676
<i>and then he can have his operation.</i>

696
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,845
<i>If I'm right, his heart will stop.</i>

697
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,151
<i>Kutner, have the paddles on standby.</i>

698
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,592
<i>Another chance to blow someone up.</i>

699
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,662
There'll be some minor discomfort

700
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,756
and you'll feel a slow,
steady pulling sensation.

701
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,698
Are you sure his heart
is ready for this?

702
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,202
Absolutely.

703
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,431
He's convinced he's sure.

704
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,269
<i>Whereas I care about your son,</i>

705
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,940
<i>and have therefore brought
a professional defibrillist.</i>

706
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,245
We're not gonna need those.

707
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,556
Dad, I feel fine, and my
finger hasn't moved in a while.

708
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,958
Okay. Take him off.

709
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,225
Here we go.

710
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,649
Heart rates 85 beats per
minute. BP 110 over 70.

711
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,158
<i>Is he okay?</i>

712
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,992
I feel the same.

713
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,296
He's fine. You're fine.

714
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,799
Thank God!

715
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,630
What do you mean, thank God?

716
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,105
<i>God's the guy who gave it to him.</i>

717
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,840
Thank you. Thank you.

718
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,000
Can you tell us about the procedure?

719
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,367
We have to use both an extra
and intracranial approach

720
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,771
to get enough exposure to
reduce the encephalocele cyst

721
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,809
and do the bony reconstruction.

722
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,306
<i>And how are you participating
in this procedure?</i>

723
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,679
She's not.

724
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:30,179
<i>They don't want me here because
they think the kid's cured. I don't.</i>

725
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,222
And what do you think the problem is?

726
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,689
<i>I wish I knew.</i>

727
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:37,023
<i>I just know that if Dr. House is
right, something's gonna go wrong.</i>

728
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,688
<i>Dr. House doesn't think he's right.</i>

729
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,631
<i>Well, then I'll just waste a
few hours watching a surgery.</i>

730
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,134
<i>See, the danger is,
we have to reconstruct</i>

731
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,398
all the way down to the cranial base,

732
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,803
<i>and there are some
big vessels down there.</i>

733
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,001
<i>So, what we'll do is we'll
work our way down to here...</i>

734
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,601
<i>When were these pictures taken?</i>

735
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,772
<i>Well, about three weeks
ago. Why? What do you see?</i>

736
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,009
Well, the acanthosis
nigricans was already there.

737
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,850
It's been there a lot longer than
that, probably his whole life.

738
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,855
<i>What about around his hairline?</i>

739
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,354
What? There's no discoloration.

740
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,859
<i>There is now.</i>

741
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,901
I have a new theory.

742
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,808
Their bad ideas don't indicate
a lack of intelligence,

743
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,968
they indicate an open mind.

744
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,605
The willingness not to be
trapped by conventional...

745
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,208
You've got a problem.

746
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,511
Tell me something I don't know.

747
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,849
You hire beautiful girls, enslave
them, force them to be around you

748
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,855
because you don't know how to
have an actual relationship.

749
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,723
If they're qualified, keep them.
If not, fire them and ask them out.

750
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:46,661
You do realize that, "Tell me something
I don't know" is just an expression?

751
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,062
Thirteen... You think that just because

752
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,260
she is as beautiful, ergo, you think that
because she hasn't had a decent idea...

753
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:55,965
No. My point is she's about to enter
your office, so you should shut up.

754
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,409
You were right about the diagnosis.

755
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,002
Yes, it was JRA. I'm very proud.

756
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,240
No, I mean you were right about
being wrong. He's got Lyme disease.

757
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,442
It explains everything.

758
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:11,417
Could you just hold up some fingers
so I can see if I'm literally blind?

759
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,616
We ruled out Lyme disease hours ago.

760
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:14,713
All the symptoms fit.

761
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,816
I am so ashamed.

762
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,087
Is she really that good looking?

763
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,219
Apparently.

764
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,389
How many lives have been
lost because of pretty girls?

765
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,455
The target rash is hiding.

766
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,501
No one ever looked
at him closely enough.

767
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,770
She's getting uglier by the second.

768
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,773
<i>We can try and pretend we're above it</i>

769
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,475
<i>and we can try and
intellectualize it away,</i>

770
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,145
<i>but ultimately, shiny,
pretty, perky things are good</i>

771
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:21,549
<i>and ugly, misshapen,
teenage boys are repulsive.</i>

772
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:28,859
<i>The question was, do you resent Dr.
Cuddy's interference in your practice?</i>

773
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:30,826
<i>Oh.</i>

774
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,867
<i>Well, then I guess my answer
wasn't very helpful, was it?</i>

775
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,206
"Mini-stud", stand up.

776
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,948
I spoke to your other partner.

777
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,150
After Cuddy told you...

778
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,626
No, I stayed away. Did
it all over the phone.

779
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,596
I asked for a reference. Said you were
applying for a plastic surgery job.

780
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:01,892
Oh, God!

781
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:02,955
Yeah.

782
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,626
He went nuts. Apparently
you signed a non-compete.

783
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,231
Now, why would you agree to that?

784
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,137
I don't wanna practice plastic surgery.

785
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,904
You sign a contract because
someone's making you.

786
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,502
Someone's getting something from you.

787
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,604
What did they give you in return?

788
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,412
They agreed to keep their mouths shut.

789
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:25,478
So you gave up your chosen
career just so they'd be quiet?

790
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,554
I love my wife.

791
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,759
You risked this job with
nothing to fall back on.

792
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,600
I thought you were wrong.

793
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,104
Sit back down.

794
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,383
You're keeping him
because he's a philanderer?

795
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,782
Where do I sign up?

796
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:58,652
Ask the Mormon. I'm keeping
him because he's interesting.

797
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,720
Dr. Terzi, would you please stand up?

798
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,162
Nice.

799
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,599
I have treated you unfairly.

800
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,034
Pre-judged you.

801
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,742
And for me to be a better person,

802
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,677
I have to rectify that situation.

803
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,236
You're fired.

804
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,451
You wanna grab some dinner?

805
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,381
Maybe a movie?

806
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,416
Seriously.

807
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,303
<i>Just days ago, with
Kenny's condition worsening.</i>

808
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:57,073
<i>It was Dr. Gregory House
reassuring Kenny and his father.</i>

809
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,478
<i>I care about your son.</i>

810
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,416
<i>The charming House, who
happens to be a film buff</i>

811
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:05,717
<i>with a soft spot in his heart for
children told us how he got his start.</i>

812
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,587
<i>See, I became a doctor because
of the movie, Patch Adams.</i>

813
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,321
<i>Determined to save the
boy's life, as well as...</i>

814
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:12,953
The horror.

815
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,125
Well, it's nice of them
to send us an early copy.

816
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,430
Not so much sent as stolen.

817
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:23,028
<i>It was Dr. Gregory House who
served as not only a doctor,</i>

818
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,302
<i>but a rock for Kenny and his father.</i>

819
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,503
<i>You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.</i>

820
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,410
<i>House, one of those rare doctors...</i>

821
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,607
God!

822
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,307
<i>...who wears his heart on his sleeve.</i>

823
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,709
I was saying that was
a stupid thing to do!

824
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,482
It's difficult not to be moved.

825
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,818
Oh, stop it.

826
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,485
Suddenly, I don't feel I can
trust Michael Moore movies.

827
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,153
Where are you going?

828
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,630
Kittens to get out of
trees? Deaf kids to read to?

829
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:53,396
I owe it to the world to make sure
this evil never sees the light of day.

830
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,766
<i>Is there anything else?</i>

831
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,178
<i>Thank you, Dr. House.</i>

832
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,017
<i>Thank you.</i>
