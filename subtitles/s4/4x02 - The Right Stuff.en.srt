1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,265
<i>Big Eye, this is Cobra Zero Six.</i>

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,998
<i>Just entered Indian Country,
approaching way point four.</i>

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:09,132
<i>Request confirmation to engage
target on first approach.</i>

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,608
<i>Roger, Cobra Zero Six.</i>

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,145
<i>Big Eye waiting for
confirmation as well.</i>

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,475
<i>If we wait any longer, Big Eye,</i>

7
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,878
<i>we're not gonna have
any choice in the matter.</i>

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,042
<i>I can't exactly do a U-turn here.</i>

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,609
<i>Roger that, Cobra.
Hold for confirmation.</i>

10
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,604
Captain Cooper, are you okay?

11
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,071
What happened? You weren't answering.

12
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,540
Because the damn comm
cord got disconnected!

13
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,406
You spend a billion
dollars on the avionics

14
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,469
and don't bother to
check the comm connection?

15
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,071
No, I checked that twice
before you got in...

16
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,639
And the next time you ask
us to test a prototype,

17
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,947
it'd be nice if your directional
gyro didn't spin like a top

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,215
when I'm supposed to be
500 feet off the floor.

19
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,654
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:34,716
I'll go review the simulation, see
if I can figure out what went wrong.

21
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,731
Who is this man?

22
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,801
Come on, take a shot.

23
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,345
I'm not gonna fire you every
time you get a wrong answer.

24
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,640
Neville Chamberlain.

25
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,840
You're fired.

26
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,680
Does this man look like he's ceding
Czechoslovakia to a fascist dictatorship?

27
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:39,214
It's Buddy Ebsen, the actor.
He's dead. Why are we...

28
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,991
<i>Buddy Ebsen was the original tin
man in the Wizard of Oz, for a day.</i>

29
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,297
He was diagnosed allergic to
the aluminum dust in the makeup.

30
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:51,030
His lungs failed. He nearly
died. Question is, why?

31
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,731
Didn't you just say he was allergic?

32
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:56,605
You may not have legs, but you
got ears. I suggest you use them.

33
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,201
I said he was diagnosed allergic.

34
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,045
Since we are currently short
exactly one interesting patient,

35
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:07,177
we are gonna figure out what really
happened to Buddy Ebsen in 1938.

36
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,312
Now, on one hand, he's
not getting deader.

37
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,723
On the other hand, your jobs
hang in the balance. So...

38
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,351
House?

39
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,227
I want seven alternate
diagnoses when I get back.

40
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,199
Did you forget how to count to three?

41
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,435
I get a budget for three.

42
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,909
Doesn't mean I can only hire three.

43
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,673
Actually, that's exactly what it means.

44
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,180
I cut the permanent salaries by 10%.

45
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,116
Over three years, that'll more than
make up for the breakage on the 27

46
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,880
that I'm gonna weed out
over the next few weeks.

47
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,649
There's 40 people in there.

48
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,317
Row D, you're fired.

49
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,892
I didn't actually count all the resumes.

50
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,091
This is stupid. You can't
manage that many people.

51
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,293
You're just gonna keep
weeding them out arbitrarily?

52
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,393
Sure, and having them
sitting in my office

53
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,902
schmoozing about their
favorite Algerian surfing movies

54
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,804
is a much better system.

55
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,638
Wait a second. Were you in Row D? Yes.

56
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,475
My apologies. My boss says
I'm being arbitrary and stupid.

57
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,482
Row D is not fired. Row C is fired!

58
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,643
What? Great. Thank you.

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,814
See, that was not arbitrary.

60
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,017
Well, I'd love to chat,
but I've been paged.

61
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,260
That's interesting.

62
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,852
Apparently, I paged myself.

63
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,100
If you have a resume
there, I'm not interested.

64
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,146
But I wouldn't mind hearing
how you got my pager number.

65
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,011
It's not a resume.

66
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,651
$50,000.

67
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,155
Does One-Eyed Nicky want me
to run that to Jimmy the Nose?

68
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,350
It's for my medical bills.

69
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,517
I need you to find out
what's wrong with me.

70
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,995
Insurance is usually cheaper than that.

71
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,760
Cash means there's something to hide.

72
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,301
I'm a captain in the Air Force,

73
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,064
about to start a new assignment.

74
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,835
NASA's astronaut training program.

75
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,371
I discovered salt and created FM radio.

76
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,311
Something is wrong
with my eyes, my ears...

77
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,613
Well, if it's fixable, the
Air Force will do it for free.

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,717
If not, it doesn't matter.

79
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,120
There are a hundred applicants
ready to take my place

80
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,885
who don't need to be fixed.

81
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,789
I need to do this off the books.

82
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,727
I did the research. You're
the best, you break rules,

83
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,357
and you don't care about
anyone except yourself.

84
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,328
Well, let's say that's true.

85
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,735
You get a new job.

86
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,637
Hospital gets a nice wad of cash.

87
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,138
What do I get?

88
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,044
I crashed a flight simulator

89
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,544
because I started to hear with my eyes.

90
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,817
The aluminum could have been tainted...

91
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,918
Don't care. New patient!

92
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,087
30-year-old female
with synesthesia.

93
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,768
New rules.

94
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,564
You generate a lab report, you shred it.

95
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,437
X
- ray, you melt it.

96
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,272
No notes, no records, nothing.

97
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,347
As far as you're concerned,
the patient is Osama Bin Laden

98
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:26,283
and everyone not in this room
is Delta Force. Any questions?

99
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,082
We're protecting Osama Bin Laden?

100
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,417
It's a metaphor.

101
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,651
Get used to it. Any more questions?

102
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,820
And you're not even
gonna tell us her name?

103
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,863
You think her name might be
connected to what's wrong with her?

104
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,863
Here's Osama.

105
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:53,173
Now, you all have numbers, so
we're gonna do this alphabetically.

106
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,446
8, 15 and 5.

107
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,040
Is the synesthesia new?

108
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,509
Yes.

109
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,179
Any history of similar
symptoms or psychiatric...

110
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,517
No, nothing.

111
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,081
Are you on any prescription
meds or use any other drugs?

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,094
No. Should we trust her answers?

113
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,097
What, you think I'd pull you off
Buddy Ebsen just for a junkie?

114
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,496
Can we trust your answers?

115
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,897
You gotta trust someone, right?

116
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,264
No.

117
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,032
Has anyone close to you been sick
lately? A family member, co-worker?

118
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,869
No, not that I'm aware of.

119
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,704
Two down. Kitty Carlisle?

120
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,576
Do you spend much
time above 20,000 feet?

121
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,473
Why would you ask that?

122
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,815
People who fly are
immobile for long periods.

123
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,821
Could be a leg clot that embolized
to the brain through a PFO.

124
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,550
That's an unusual choice.

125
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,185
Well, like you said, you wouldn't
interrupt Buddy with anything that wasn't.

126
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,391
The patient is a frequent flyer.

127
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:53,194
13, 32, 39, get Osama an
EEG, MRI and angiogram.

128
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,399
How many of you think
that Oswald acted alone?

129
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,277
Lf, by alone, you mean that
he was unaware that the CIA...

130
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,373
Oh, shut up.

131
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,816
Split yourself into two groups.

132
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,286
Test her blood. Test her stool.

133
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,616
Who likes the designated hitter?

134
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,026
You're wrong. You're
lucky you're not fired.

135
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,463
Two more groups LP and cultures.

136
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,195
Who doesn't know what
a designated hitter is?

137
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,405
Okay, here's her address.

138
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,033
I want you to break in and
find out what she's hiding.

139
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,442
Why don't we just ask
the patient for the key?

140
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,644
Well, if you can find out what
she's hiding just by asking,

141
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,243
we'd have to redefine hiding.

142
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,646
You want to live in this
country, learn the language.

143
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,151
What do you want the rest of us to do?

144
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,260
30 people for three openings
and I want you to wash my car?

145
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,461
This is not why I busted
my ass in med school.

146
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,596
We spend a half an hour
cleaning the car. Big deal.

147
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,333
It's demeaning.

148
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,103
Work is demeaning?
We're too good for this?

149
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,269
Oh, don't give me that
honest day's labor crap.

150
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,644
We all went to med school so we wouldn't
have to do an honest day's labor.

151
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,580
What about an honest hour's labor?

152
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,050
In exchange, we get a shot at learning

153
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,451
from one of the best
diagnosticians in the world.

154
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,318
No, we don't.

155
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,653
If we did, we'd be one of the ones
drawing blood or checking for toxins.

156
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,160
We're done.

157
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,787
He's just not gonna cut us loose

158
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,095
until we've dusted his
shelves and starched his shirt.

159
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,371
I'm out of here. Who's with me?

160
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,984
Are we sure he wasn't joking?

161
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,183
Maybe this is just a test.

162
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,455
Everything's a joke and everything's
a test and he wants us to do it.

163
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,654
Come on, get up here.

164
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,698
Well, I could try, but I
pulled a muscle in 1987.

165
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,667
I didn't waste two years repeating
medical school to be arrested and deported.

166
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,363
Why'd they make you repeat?

167
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,303
Not enough gym credits?

168
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,341
According to the state of New Jersey,

169
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:13,276
medical schools in my country suffer
from not being from this country.

170
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,220
You know, if you get it open, you're
gonna have to come down and let me in.

171
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,313
Or, you could just wait out here.

172
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,085
This is a competition.

173
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,559
Change your mind?

174
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,026
No.

175
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,799
Then why are you here?
Never intended to quit.

176
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,538
Then why did you... Intended
to get everyone else to quit.

177
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,944
Get off the car.

178
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,447
I need to clean it. We need to clean it.

179
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,617
I stole his keys. We'll
take it to a car wash.

180
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,517
He's got people breaking
into a woman's apartment.

181
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,115
Obviously, respecting personal
property isn't one of the rules.

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,797
I told the super I was
worried about my niece.

183
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,897
She hasn't been answering the telephone.

184
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,238
Nice guy. Two daughters
in Mount Holyoke.

185
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:24,779
No evidence of clots, and other
than elevated red blood cell count,

186
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,944
the blood work was unremarkable.

187
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,924
You got a problem with
the naked female form?

188
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,489
Not at all.

189
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:40,555
Maybe she's just not used to seeing it
spooning with the naked dolphin form.

190
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,397
That's not a dolphin, it's a porpoise.

191
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,165
There is a difference, you
know. Salary, for one thing...

192
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,172
You want us to give you a minute?

193
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,846
High red blood cell
count likely means...

194
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,247
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

195
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,150
There are a lot of different
explanations for elevated red blood cells.

196
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,482
Yeah, well, which one fits best

197
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,115
with the damaged flue
that your competitors found

198
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,625
in the gas fireplace in Osama's cave?

199
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,622
Car's clean.

200
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,723
Did you just see a blond guy
with a pretentious accent?

201
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,199
Can't see an accent.

202
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,530
Good point.

203
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,127
Can I have my car keys back?

204
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,641
Give me the car keys, put the
patient in a hyperbaric chamber

205
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,735
and no more prime numbers for you.

206
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,380
Thank you.

207
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,380
The high pressure and oxygen will flush
the carbon monoxide from your system.

208
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:39,220
This much oxygen for too long can have some
toxic effects, so we'll do this in cycles.

209
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,887
Can I talk to you a second?

210
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,728
You're working that thing all
the time. Is everything all right?

211
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,859
We're supposed to be watching
her heart rate and blood pressure.

212
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,096
Yeah, I was until you
pulled me over here.

213
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,003
I'm sending out a consult
on another patient.

214
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,098
Okay.

215
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,769
What? I'm not quitting my old job
until I'm sure I've got a new one.

216
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,778
I didn't say anything. You had a look.

217
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,314
Yeah, I did. Sorry.

218
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,912
Hey, I think she's
having a heart attack.

219
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,283
No, I just feel a little funny.

220
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,479
Tachyarrhythmia.

221
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,115
Call the code!

222
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,855
Nothing.

223
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,126
V
- fib. Where the hell is... Clear!

224
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,963
Are you crazy? You can't use
those! We're in a hyperbaric...

225
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,127
Clear!

226
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,532
She's on fire!

227
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,648
Her heart's beating.

228
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,189
And we are so fired.

229
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,192
We've started her on
nitro and blood thinners.

230
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,860
Electrolytes and
post-arrest EKG were normal.

231
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,995
The attack was not
caused by the procedure.

232
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,936
So, what does cause synesthesia,

233
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,065
high red blood cell
count and heart attack?

234
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:07,636
Aren't we gonna discuss what caused
the sudden appearance of burnt flesh?

235
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,142
He brought charged paddles
into an oxygenated room.

236
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,708
And you didn't stop him.

237
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:18,313
Means either you thought it was a chance
worth taking, making you a hypocrite,

238
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,723
or you thought he'd fail, making
you a cutthroat little pixie.

239
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,153
What causes... Takayasu's syndrome.

240
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,961
Not without a rash and a
fever. It's gotta be Whipple's.

241
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,661
No way. You ever see Whipple's
without abdominal pain?

242
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,169
Stop it!

243
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,139
This argument is distracting
every male and lesbian here.

244
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,734
You're both right.

245
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,334
In the sense that you've convinced
me that you're both wrong.

246
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,436
What about cardiomyopathy?

247
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,004
Structural abnormality
causes the heart attack

248
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,951
and throws clots to the
brain, leading to synesthesia.

249
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,146
How old are you?

250
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,815
I'm 21, unless it's relevant.

251
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,385
Okay, Scooter.

252
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,226
Do a transoesophageal echo.

253
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,790
And since the positive divisors of
26, are 2 and 13, have them assist.

254
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,028
The rest of you, go to the cafeteria.

255
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,130
Document 10 things that
can cause infection, each.

256
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:25,147
I wouldn't. Someone named 17 thinks there
could be lysteria in the cream cheese.

257
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,722
17's a stupid number.

258
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,561
What's Chase doing here?

259
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,028
You saw Chase?

260
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,758
Last night. Outside my office.

261
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,631
That's interesting.

262
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,629
It's more curious than actually...

263
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:43,436
Chase took a job at the Mayo
Clinic in Arizona a week ago.

264
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,169
Interesting.

265
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:54,453
It wasn't Foreman or Cameron you
saw, but Chase, the one you fired.

266
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,454
Not interesting.

267
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,889
Someone who looked like someone I
used to know walked by my office.

268
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,794
It's always interesting when repressed
guilt starts unrepressing itself.

269
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,991
The only thing I feel
guilty for is this.

270
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,004
We're gonna feed this
endoscope down your esophagus,

271
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,944
try to find where your
heart might be damaged.

272
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,744
It's gonna feel uncomfortable,
but just keep swallowing,

273
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,410
I promise you'll be fine.

274
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,219
She's ready.

275
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,919
Go ahead, take a whack.

276
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,486
Right, so if we don't find
anything, House blames me.

277
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,327
Or you find something
and get a gold star.

278
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,832
Why don't you wanna do it?

279
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,700
House isn't gonna be impressed by a
gray hair doing his ten-thousandth echo.

280
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,170
So, you're just being altruistic?

281
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,231
That makes you suspicious, Doctor...

282
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,912
Call me 13. I'm not getting invested.

283
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,811
Her heart's structurally sound.

284
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,285
No clots, no valvular defects,
no wall motion abnormalities.

285
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,049
Got that from structurally sound.

286
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,023
What did she say? Structurally sound.

287
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,855
I assume you're not all walking with
me to tell me you found nothing...

288
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,952
It showed a short burst in the...

289
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,061
Okay. Who's next?

290
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,726
It showed a short
burst of atrial flutter.

291
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,633
I ran a rhythm strip twice
and got the same result.

292
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,796
Stop.

293
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,540
Okay, here's how we diagnose in transit.

294
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,068
I lead, you draft, I move, you
move, I stop, you stop. Got it?

295
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,238
Flutter could mean
hormone overproduction...

296
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,611
Wait a second. Why did you do
the test? I gave it to Scooter.

297
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,775
We didn't think it mattered. It doesn't.

298
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,785
It matters that you let her.

299
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:40,758
Okay, 10, 24, 39, run a TRH
stimulation test for hyperthyroidism.

300
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,124
That could cause another heart attack.

301
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,926
Proving her first attack
was caused by her thyroid,

302
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,627
which is kind of the point, right?

303
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,065
Uh-uh,
uh-uh, uh-uh.

304
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,297
I ride alone.

305
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,705
The hormones stimulate your thyroid.

306
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,973
Don't worry if you get
flushed or you start to sweat.

307
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,810
It means the thyroid's working.

308
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,312
And, if you want, I
can remove that mole.

309
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,785
I'm a plastic surgeon. You're
allowed a little vanity.

310
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,915
I'm fine with the way I look.

311
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,481
Good for you.

312
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:19,721
Although, I do find it a bit
odd that someone so self-assured

313
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,460
doesn't want her doctors to
find out what's wrong with her.

314
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,764
What are you talking
about? Why else am I here?

315
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:29,069
You're jerking us around. You're
handcuffing us with all these restrictions.

316
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,870
I'm feeling warm.

317
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,941
Her pulse is 120. Stop pushing.

318
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,572
If House thought this would handicap
us, he wouldn't have taken the case.

319
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,172
Or maybe that's why he took the case.

320
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,343
He wants to see if we can
get it out of her on our own.

321
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,683
What did you find at her home?

322
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,415
You were in my home? Nothing.

323
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,220
Travel pictures, yearbook,
her name on an employment slip?

324
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,056
We weren't checking
for that stuff, okay?

325
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,790
Obviously, House didn't want us to.

326
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,492
You're gonna... You're
gonna out me, aren't you?

327
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,863
You're gonna ruin everything.

328
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,596
Nobody's trying to do
anything, just relax.

329
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,165
This is not a normal response to
the test. Pulse and BP are too high.

330
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,834
Get away from me.

331
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,413
Get away from me! Don't touch me!

332
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:24,388
<i>Paging me during Judge Judy, not
the best way to win my affections.</i>

333
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,953
She had another episode of synesthesia.

334
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,328
It set off a psychotic attack.

335
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,867
And now she ran in there, and must
have jammed something in the handles.

336
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,562
So, you call me?

337
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,333
The guy with one good
leg and zero leverage?

338
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,839
We break that door down, security
shows up and her name goes in a file.

339
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,814
Luckily, violence is
not the last resort.

340
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,412
Extortion is. So, go ahead. Extort her.

341
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,120
If you don't open this door,
we're gonna break it down.

342
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,393
Clever.

343
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:02,229
An appeal to her deep concern for hospital
property. Let's see how that works.

344
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,266
If you don't open this
door, you're going to die.

345
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,638
Go away!

346
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,039
Well, you seem to be getting to her.

347
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,908
She doesn't care if she dies.

348
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,106
You think she wants to die?

349
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,480
No, but I think she only wants to
live under certain circumstances.

350
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,519
Open up, or I blab
your secret to everyone.

351
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,854
You don't know anything.

352
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,689
I do.

353
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,368
No!

354
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,710
Anybody think that a sedative might...

355
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,039
I'm trying. Okay!

356
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,216
Who's that?

357
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,349
Who is she?

358
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,225
Osama Bin Laden.

359
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,870
Who is she?

360
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,277
Is she okay?

361
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,978
She's stable. Who is she?

362
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,552
What did House tell you?

363
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,353
That she is on the run from an
international crime syndicate.

364
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,859
That's what he told us.

365
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,055
House may be your boss,
but I'm House's boss.

366
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,656
You wanna work here, I
better be okay with it!

367
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,725
Honestly, he didn't tell us anything
about who she was or what she...

368
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,668
Her name's Greta Cooper.

369
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,800
Wants to be an astronaut.

370
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,538
Doesn't want NASA to know her brain's
getting her ears confused with her eyes.

371
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,674
I went through her mail.

372
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,849
You're a virus, House. Now instead
of one liability, I've got 20.

373
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,448
Apparently only 19. Which number was it?

374
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,153
From now on, everything
you do gets charted.

375
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,354
With pen, on paper,
in a binder that says,

376
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,694
"Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching
Hospital" on the cover.

377
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,857
Mom!

378
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,163
If you wanna run something
through the labs, I get a copy.

379
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,226
If you do scans, I get a copy.

380
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:22,899
If you think about doing
scans, I get a copy.

381
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,375
You know my current thoughts, right?
I don't have to put those on paper.

382
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,241
Three issues.

383
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:36,310
One, number 10, you're fired.

384
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,114
She told you?

385
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,181
Well, it had to be someone
who went to her home.

386
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,250
Number 26 is half asleep.
Missed his afternoon nap.

387
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,659
Obviously, he doesn't feel guilt.

388
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,595
Number 2 is here on a
visa, she can't jeopardize.

389
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,757
You can't know.

390
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,893
And that chick's been pointing
at you since I walked in.

391
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,402
Issue two, what causes synesthesia,

392
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,807
high RBC, tachyarrhythmia
and panic attacks?

393
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,311
Slight glucose elevation.
That says thyroid.

394
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,144
Baseline thyrotropin's 1.1. 1.3.

395
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,410
Whatever. Her thyroid's working.

396
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,610
What about her liver?

397
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,449
Original ALT levels weren't
abnormal, but were near the edge.

398
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,386
She has patient data
on her PDA. I do not.

399
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,947
I saw the lab values. You said
we couldn't write anything down.

400
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,458
I also said I wanted answers.

401
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,394
Liver cancer's the most
likely. Paraneoplastic syndrome.

402
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,657
We need to do an MRI.

403
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,130
Which brings us to issue three.

404
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,666
You're saying we can write stuff down?

405
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,326
To you, I'm saying, you're fired.

406
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,371
To everyone else... But
you said specifically...

407
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,837
I hate tattletales.

408
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,170
She tattled on 10. Now,
you've tattled twice.

409
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,972
Issue three...

410
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,511
Come on, let's go.

411
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,175
Issue three, how do we do
tests when we can't do tests?

412
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,482
Dr. Cuddy didn't say we can't do
tests, she said we have to chart.

413
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,182
If we chart, we won't
get consent, so we can't.

414
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,521
The patient's life may
depend on her consenting.

415
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,459
Her dreams depend on her not consenting.

416
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,226
So, how do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

417
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,565
You've got an hour.

418
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,838
How do you scan a liver
without scanning a liver?

419
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,708
And what's Cameron doing here?

420
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,181
Interesting, so you're
seeing Cameron now.

421
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,017
No, not interesting,
because not seeing. Saw.

422
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,948
My patient won't consent
to MRIs or ultrasounds.

423
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,392
You've dealt with more liver
cancer than anyone else here.

424
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,489
So, you want me to share the secret
scanning techniques I learnt in Nepal?

425
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,228
Unfortunately, the monks
made me swear a blood oath.

426
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,394
Where was she?

427
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,562
In the lobby.

428
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,100
I guess, we could palpate
the area around the liver.

429
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,143
Which won't work unless the
tumor's enormous, which you know,

430
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,078
which means you're here because
these visions are freaking you out.

431
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,444
Did...

432
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:47,047
She had blond hair. Why
would I hallucinate that?

433
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,052
Yes, yes!

434
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,180
Why are you merging Cameron and Chase?

435
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,954
We should find out before the next
time you see her, when she'll be black.

436
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:58,518
Because, of course, it's
scientifically impossible for a person

437
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,963
to go back and visit
somewhere they worked.

438
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,091
No. But since she's not a dead cat,

439
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,660
it is scientifically impossible
for her to be in two places at once.

440
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,200
Physics joke. Don't
hear enough of those.

441
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,675
She just called me from Arizona.

442
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,439
Notice the area code, 480.

443
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,005
They put an offer on
a place in Scottsdale.

444
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,711
Do you want to talk or should
I? I guess we could both talk.

445
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,253
Although, they're engaged,
and if you're staying in touch,

446
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,845
you might wanna buy them...

447
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,692
Maybe it's not repressed
guilt, maybe it's just panic.

448
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,599
Right now, you've got enough
fellows to build a railroad,

449
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,126
but you're gonna have to narrow that
room full of numbers down to three people.

450
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:44,073
Any chance you could turn this creative
brilliance towards my patient's liver?

451
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,906
I think you're gonna choose people

452
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,946
for reasons that have nothing
to do with their skills.

453
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:52,973
I think you're gonna choose people
just because you can't stand them.

454
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,214
Because if you like
them, well, that's just

455
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,955
stressful.

456
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,090
Stress.

457
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,422
I like it.

458
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,635
We need to stress the patient's liver.

459
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,033
You mean make her sick?

460
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,298
I mean, make her sick in a specific way.

461
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,398
If her liver's given to
malfunctioning, we make it malfunction.

462
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,409
Are we on the other side of wrong here?

463
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,241
Don't we have an ethics board
that we should consult, or...

464
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,645
I fired you.

465
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:24,875
No, you didn't.

466
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,145
He fired you, you're number 6.

467
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,448
No, I'm not. I'm number 9.

468
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,318
I approve of your shamelessness.

469
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,820
You're still fired.

470
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,621
So, how do we stress her liver?

471
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,162
Lying and paperwork, I get.
Shutting down organs, I think...

472
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,255
We could give her intravenous vitamin
D and stick her in a tanning booth.

473
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,894
If she goes into a coma, we
know it's a metabolic problem.

474
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,062
Nice.

475
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,401
But vitamin D's metabolized
by the liver and kidneys.

476
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,304
It wouldn't tell us
which one's screwed up.

477
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,400
We could get her wasted.

478
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,014
Give her shots of tequila and measure
how long it takes for her to pass out.

479
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,949
If it's too fast, then we know her
liver is not processing alcohol.

480
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,713
Means it's shot.

481
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,751
I like you, number 9.

482
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,627
You wanted to see me?

483
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:14,960
You a Mormon?

484
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,568
You're wearing a ring
from Brigham Young.

485
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,006
Or did your folks just do the lawns?

486
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,565
The Church has a very progressive
attitude towards racial equality.

487
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,442
Don't care. Actually, I'm thanking God.

488
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,612
You're the only non-drinker we got.

489
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,775
We need a control group

490
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,787
to establish whether the liver's
deterioration is within normal range.

491
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:40,222
Got a big drinker, a medium
drinker, now I got a no-drinker.

492
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,952
Just do an MRI.

493
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,329
You really think the guy
who created heaven and earth

494
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,959
cares what you put in
your digestive tract?

495
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,697
Her dream shouldn't
outrank my religious belief.

496
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,569
Why not? Her dream might come true.

497
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,903
All life is sacred, right?

498
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,409
We're not saving her life.
We're doing a diagnostic test.

499
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,846
Not even a real diagnostic test.

500
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,477
Well, that fake test
might really save her life.

501
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:14,056
Would you pull an ass out
of a pit on the Sabbath?

502
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,629
Would you or would you not pull
an ass out of a pit on the Sabbath?

503
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,574
Fine. I'll do it.

504
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,008
Good.

505
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,012
Why'd you have to pick tequila?

506
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,953
I assume a single malt
would've worked just as well.

507
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,922
Wasn't our choice.

508
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,185
Okay, two minutes,
then round number five.

509
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,262
So, tell me about the magic underwear.

510
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,893
Is that why you're here?

511
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,906
I'm the big drinker,
doing my part for science.

512
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,307
The interesting question is
why your religious beliefs

513
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,743
are suddenly less
important than her dreams.

514
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,144
You're reversing your argument?

515
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,512
I know what I believe.

516
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,141
I'm just not quite
sure what you believe.

517
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,415
Well, LDS doesn't try to dictate
every detail of our lives.

518
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:20,390
When a situation isn't clear, we're
encouraged to make our own decisions.

519
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,289
But your judgment was to say no.

520
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,155
You used my judgment.

521
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,662
You made a good argument.

522
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,893
Rational arguments don't
usually work on religious people.

523
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,333
Otherwise, there would
be no religious people.

524
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,596
You're an atheist.

525
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,069
Only on Christmas and Easter.

526
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,766
Rest of the time, it
doesn't really matter.

527
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,432
Where's the fun in that?

528
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,272
A finite un-mysterious universe?

529
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,279
It's not about fun.
It's about the truth.

530
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:46,340
The truth is we're having this debate because
you wanna figure something out about me.

531
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,715
What have you got so far?

532
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,322
Greta! Greta!

533
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,789
She can't breathe. We need to intubate.

534
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,189
No!

535
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,750
At least oxygen.

536
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,558
NASA will need to know why!

537
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,399
I checked the tests you ordered.

538
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,967
Did you just see Foreman?

539
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,673
You measured the density of her teeth.

540
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,581
It's a shortcut test for hypocalcaemia.

541
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,845
You had to have just passed him.

542
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,784
So, you suspected hypocalcaemia

543
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,084
from her complete lack of broken bones?

544
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,818
Is that why you also
ran three tox screens?

545
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,053
Patient might have been sneaking uppers.

546
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,527
He was in a white coat.
Did you hire him back?

547
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,157
Foreman is running the diagnostic
department at New York Mercy.

548
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,835
Have you been drinking?

549
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,225
She was having trouble breathing.

550
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,060
Refused oxygen and intubation.

551
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,761
So you put her on a treadmill?

552
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:15,863
Records will show that we gave her oxygen
as a part of a routine cardio stress test.

553
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,273
She gets to breathe, your
boss gets her paperwork.

554
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,039
Whose idea was that?

555
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,537
It was a joint decision.

556
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,807
It never is.

557
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,253
So, how old were you when
your brother left home?

558
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,846
Why do you think that I...
Why aren't you answering?

559
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,691
Did your mother initiate the divorce?

560
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,955
We should probably focus on
what's wrong with her lungs.

561
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,121
Are you Wiccan?

562
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,630
She really can't breathe.

563
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,031
Okay. Hold still.

564
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,630
What are you doing?

565
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,674
Auscultatory percussion.

566
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,676
If you have a good ear, you can...

567
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,714
You didn't have a lot of friends,
because you chose not to...

568
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,579
You can hear while you're talking?

569
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:05,285
You can detect not only structural
details, but small, deep masses.

570
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,119
Game's over.

571
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,466
You either have lung cancer
or tuberous sclerosis.

572
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,995
We need to cut you open and biopsy.

573
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,300
That'll

574
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,007
leave a scar.

575
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,841
NASA doctors will see it. They'll know.

576
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:33,145
I never opened for Springsteen
or slept with Barbara Feldon.

577
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,345
You can live for years without
dreams. Without lungs...

578
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,013
Find a way.

579
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,284
Okay.

580
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,989
As long as you keep saying
it strongly, you won't die.

581
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,667
Find a way.

582
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,137
How do we force a patient into surgery?

583
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,438
Texas bag scam? Saratoga Wire?

584
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,209
Paris Exposition Trick?

585
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,683
The problem's not the
surgery, it's the scars,

586
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,118
and we have a plastic surgeon
here who can hide them.

587
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,282
Not that well. NASA's
gonna check every cranny.

588
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,088
I say we just put ether in her
oxygen and do what we have to do.

589
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,218
She'll sue.

590
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,353
For what?

591
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,227
Making it harder for her
to lie to the government?

592
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,130
We don't need to hide them.

593
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,726
We give her elective cosmetic surgery.

594
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,033
The incisions will give
us access to her lungs.

595
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,768
And she's got an innocent
explanation for the scars.

596
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,537
You mean, like, liposuction.

597
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,579
No, no. Those incisions
are too far from the lungs.

598
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,479
We don't subtract. We add.

599
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,016
Turn her Bs into Cs.

600
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:48,056
It's myth that fake hooters blow
up at high altitude. She'll be fine.

601
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,158
Just think of it as one
giant rack for mankind.

602
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,126
I fought for years
to be taken seriously.

603
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,761
Trust me, you'll be taken more
seriously. Just sign the form.

604
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,934
This'll make me a joke.

605
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,702
There's gotta be another way.

606
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,615
I've known a few people who had dreams.

607
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:15,778
One thing they all had in
common was they got laughed at

608
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,212
and they didn't care.

609
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,665
You bumped a splenectomy for a boob job?

610
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,466
Would you condemn this woman to a life

611
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,734
where people look at her
face when they talk to her?

612
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,402
If you don't explain this,
I'll cancel the surgery.

613
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,638
Can I explain why you're here?

614
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,407
I think I just told you why I...

615
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:48,009
I scheduled a diagnostic patient
for a boob job. Which is ridiculous.

616
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,815
So, obviously you had to confront me.

617
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,184
With you so far.

618
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,415
But I'm gonna give you a reason.

619
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,616
Not a good one.

620
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,057
No. Not even close to a good one.

621
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,661
But here's the drag
from your point of view.

622
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,925
My explanation will make sense.

623
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:05,025
Not to the board, not
to a judge, but to you.

624
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,435
So you'll let me do it.

625
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:11,134
Then, you're gonna have to sit next
to me at the administrative hearing.

626
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,606
Don't you have better things to do?

627
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,281
It's in the best
interests of the patient.

628
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,992
Trocar's in, you're good to go.

629
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,735
Deflate the lung.

630
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,606
There, a cyst.

631
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,303
Cysts, I count three of them.

632
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,815
Probably the same, if not
more, on the left lung.

633
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:56,252
Okay, so what's been working
overtime to kill Miss Bin Laden?

634
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,348
We know her name now.

635
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,083
Yeah, but I forgot it.

636
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,559
Say the magic word and get
immunity from the next challenge.

637
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,324
Alveolar hydatid disease.
Hits all the organs.

638
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,228
She'd have had multiple seizures by now.

639
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,664
Pulmonary Langerhans'.

640
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,634
Doesn't explain the red blood cells.

641
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,828
Come on!

642
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,169
Cysts, synesthesia, heart
attack. You guys have gotta...

643
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,436
<i>Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.</i>

644
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,281
<i>Raises red blood cell count,
causes masses on the organs.</i>

645
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,010
<i>If one of the masses
is a pheochromocytoma,</i>

646
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,814
<i>it could cause neurologic
episodes and a heart attack.</i>

647
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:38,959
Do you see a blonde guy who still
has peach fuzz standing up there?

648
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,492
Yeah.

649
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,461
This is a closed procedure.
Gallery's off limits.

650
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,764
<i>Not to the surgical staff.</i>

651
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,872
Are you gonna hire
that guy instead of us?

652
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,184
Not a chance. I love you guys.

653
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:08,284
Please dig out the cysts, histology
to confirm Von Hippel-Lindau.

654
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,327
Don't forget her chesticles.

655
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,870
Calling Arizona was a very nice touch.

656
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,202
You do have residual...

657
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,402
Not only do I not
have residual feelings,

658
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,138
I didn't even have primary feelings.

659
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,645
You freaked... You lied!

660
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,113
Because you knew it meant...

661
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,444
It meant nothing!

662
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,144
I saw him 'cause he was there.

663
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,847
<i>Did Cameron follow her bashert
to the surgery department?</i>

664
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,719
I think Chase followed her.

665
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,281
She's been a senior attending
in the ER the last three weeks.

666
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,794
A blonde senior
attending, to be accurate.

667
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,092
And Foreman, is he back in neurology?

668
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,224
He's at New York Mercy.
He's been there a month.

669
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,269
Did you see Foreman?

670
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,394
No.

671
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,736
<i>Doctor Chang to OR. Doctor Chang to OR.</i>

672
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,566
So, I'm cured.

673
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,478
You're fine for now, but Von
Hippel-Lindau is a genetic disease.

674
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:04,912
There's no cure.

675
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,076
Greta, you need to come clean to NASA.

676
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,750
You said you got all the cysts.

677
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,346
They could re-emerge.

678
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,952
I'll go to radiology clinics.

679
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,585
I'll get regular screenings.

680
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,994
If something happened
while you're up there,

681
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,156
you'd be playing Russian Roulette

682
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,426
with other people's... Relax.

683
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,596
She doesn't have to
tell, and neither do you.

684
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:32,200
Turns out the NASA doctors even know
where the hyphen in Von Hippel-Lindau goes.

685
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,373
You called them?

686
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,370
I'm not an idiot.

687
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,883
Those shuttles fly over New Jersey.

688
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,960
So, here we are. The big moment!

689
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:58,798
Which of you gets to live
to be abused another day?

690
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:03,636
And which of you goes home and rationalizes
being fired as character building?

691
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,870
The following numbers,
thanks for playing.

692
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:15,783
21, 19, 8, 34,

693
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,718
17,

694
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,280
29, 5,

695
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,085
36, 2.

696
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,888
The rest of you, 8 a. m. Sharp.

697
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,728
I'll be in sometime
between 10:00 and 3:00.

698
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,234
Oh, and 26, stick around a while.

699
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,272
I did nothing wrong.

700
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,076
Lots of people did nothing wrong.

701
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,874
Other people screwed up, I never even...

702
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,074
Other people took chances.

703
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,283
26?

704
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,654
Buddy Ebsen actually was allergic to...

705
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,157
Yeah, I know. How old are you?

706
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,693
21.

707
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,592
You don't think it's relevant.

708
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,187
I'll likely have less time to
use the skills you teach us,

709
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,096
but I don't think that's
significant to you.

710
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,068
How about the fact that you
never went to medical school?

711
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:11,032
Which is why you let the
unlucky number do the trans echo.

712
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,441
At least you're ethically unethical.

713
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:21,084
30 years I worked in the Columbia
med school admissions office.

714
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,815
Audited all the classes,
most of them, more than once.

715
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,154
I just never got a diploma.

716
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,523
You had to know I'd
find out sooner or later.

717
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,023
I know you break rules.

718
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,924
I thought maybe you'd break one for me.

719
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,998
I can't hire you as a doctor.

720
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,899
But you can still
tell me what you think.

721
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,103
You could also fetch me coffee
and pick up my dry cleaning.

722
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,613
Until I can decide
whether or not to keep you.

723
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,742
So, I'm playing this whole game
to be, like, your secretary?

724
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,310
Assistant sounds
marginally less demeaning.

725
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,247
It's not my dream job.

726
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,691
Actually, it is. It's
just not your dream title.

727
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,746
Three weeks.

728
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,280
For someone who never misses something
small, you missed something big.

729
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,661
You're an idiot.

730
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,762
The hair, where I'm working, or both?

731
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,800
The hair makes you look like a hooker.

732
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,900
I like it.

733
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,596
Pulling pieces of windshield
out of car accident victims,

734
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,801
and reattaching fingertips
sliced off cutting bagels?

735
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,672
At least Chase's move
is only one step down.

736
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,375
I can do good here.
Get it out of my system.

737
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,012
Why'd you rat your patient out to NASA?

738
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,923
I don't know who's been gossiping
about ethics instead of sex,

739
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,984
but I hope they've already been fired.

740
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,689
Which number was it? Greta.

741
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,664
Number. No number, the patient.

742
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,667
How do you think she
got your pager number?

743
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,293
She came into the ER,
didn't want to talk...

744
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,667
I didn't rat her out.

745
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,035
You lied?

746
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,137
I suppose I should tell her
that before she keys my car.

747
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,734
Why lie?

748
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,938
I had to stop some leaky faucets.

749
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,346
What did it matter?

750
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,914
It was no one's business.

751
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,244
Right.

752
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,482
She's gonna be the
safest astronaut up there.

753
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,816
Certainly more vigilant than the
guy next to her who's got no clue

754
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,225
about the aneurysm in
his head ready to pop.

755
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,627
Right.

756
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,832
You got a better reason?

757
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,100
You couldn't kill her dream.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
