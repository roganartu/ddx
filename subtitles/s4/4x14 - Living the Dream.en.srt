1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,894
Brock, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,995
Getting ready for surgery.
What's it look like?

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,038
You're operating on my sister.

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,434
And my fiancée.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,241
You're drunk. You could kill her.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,450
It's the only way to stop
my hands from shaking.

7
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,882
I need to drink.

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,484
For Anna.

9
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,490
What about our baby?

10
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,227
Our baby?

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:38,102
Brock! Oh, my God! Brock, are
you okay? Brock, speak to me.

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,833
Oh, my God! I think he's really hurt.

13
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,035
Cut!

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,176
That was scary. I thought for
a second you were really...

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,310
Then you're going to be the
only one in the world who did.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,710
This is ridiculous.

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,778
That was great, Evan.

18
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,084
No, it wasn't. It was crap.

19
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,386
The fans are going to love it.

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,154
The fans are crap. I'm crap.

21
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,094
This whole damn show is crap!

22
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,029
Sorry, not your fault.

23
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:41,198
Where are you going? My
apartment's on the West Side.

24
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,031
Excuse me, you need to go the other way.

25
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,966
Hey, did you hear what I said?

26
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,512
What the hell's going on
here? What do you want?

27
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,610
An autographed picture would be nice.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,612
Oh, and I'm also going
to save your life.

29
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,859
You might want to think about
repositioning the crosswalk.

30
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,062
It's technically not a violation, but
the closer they are to the entrance,

31
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,729
the more likely they are to be used.

32
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,102
Makes sense.

33
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,698
Listen, I actually wasn't
expecting you until next month.

34
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,268
Yeah, that's the problem with planned
visits, administrators plan for them.

35
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,075
The most recent New Jersey
Hospital Accreditation requirements.

36
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,709
Yeah, I'm familiar with...

37
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,227
Who is that?

38
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,032
I have no idea. Shall we get started?

39
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,740
Just let me go. I won't press
charges. I'll forget the whole thing.

40
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,298
That's probably true, seeing
as how you have a brain tumor.

41
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,176
You're that nut-job doctor
that keeps calling my publicist.

42
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,909
Actually, I'm the nut-job
Head of Diagnostic Medicine.

43
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:42,114
I run every day. I don't get headaches.
I'm fine. So, if you don't mind...

44
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,849
Actually, I do mind.

45
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,449
I don't care if you die,
but if Brock Sterling dies,

46
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,928
Anna never finds out he's
the father of Marie's baby.

47
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,760
Help!

48
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,929
We're gonna need a wheelchair here!

49
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,531
Look, in the last month,

50
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,598
your average line reading has
slowed from 2.1 seconds to 2.9.

51
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,678
You're pausing more,
always at the same interval,

52
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,439
every seven to nine words,

53
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,346
which means you're having trouble
reading one side of the teleprompter,

54
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,815
which means a peripheral vision problem,

55
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,012
which means a tumor
in your occipital lobe.

56
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,455
Just one test. If there's nothing
wrong, I'll take you right back home.

57
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,859
Make it cab fare. I don't want
you anywhere near my house.

58
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,898
Just put it in my spot.

59
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,070
The Accreditation Board is here
to protect us and our patients.

60
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,807
So, in dealing with
the onsite inspector,

61
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:47,410
please behave as if it wasn't also an
enormous pain in the ass. Thank you.

62
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,685
Chase, Foreman,
Cameron, up here, please.

63
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,418
Why is House driving a limo?

64
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,520
Don't know. Don't have to know.

65
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,532
Don't care. Wrong.

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,228
Until this inspection is over
you're back on House-watch.

67
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,530
Current case. Past cases.

68
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,593
He doesn't have a current case.

69
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,832
I have a whole department.

70
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,965
And are you going to
fire us if we don't?

71
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,840
I was just asking for your help.

72
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,851
The last time I checked the ER, you had
the best-kept charts in the building.

73
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,083
Last time I checked the 4th-floor
janitor's closet, I found House's charts.

74
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,055
He hasn't filed anything since you left.

75
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,288
Now, House may not care whether this
hospital's accreditation gets downgraded,

76
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,263
but the people who sign my paychecks
do. So, I repeat: Current. Past.

77
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,095
He doesn't have a current case.

78
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,465
Did he tell you about the limo?

79
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,963
So, I just press this button
every time I see a light?

80
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,201
Tells me where your blind spots are.

81
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,743
So, the twins,

82
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,145
they're going to turn out
to be yours, aren't they?

83
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,046
I told you, I can't
talk about that stuff.

84
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,145
But you want to be
done with this, right?

85
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,282
One's mine, one's Julio's.

86
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,392
I knew it!

87
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:06,059
Julio knocked her up before her
appendix burst. You got her after.

88
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,558
How can you watch that stuff?

89
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,098
Because it's awesome.

90
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,798
It's preposterous, not one real
moment since I've been on the show.

91
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:18,343
As opposed to shows that represent the
world exactly the way it is, like...

92
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,340
Can't think of any.

93
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,070
What's going on?

94
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,775
Hospital is being inspected, and Cuddy
dispatched you to keep an eye on me.

95
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,149
I just parked a Town
Car in an ambulance bay,

96
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,589
and instead of ripping me one,
Cuddy acted like she didn't know me.

97
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,923
It's either an
inspection or an aneurysm.

98
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,087
What's the test say?

99
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,954
As I suspected,

100
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,428
you have significant losses in the upper
right quadrant of your visual field.

101
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,492
Are you serious?

102
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,764
No, it's a joke.

103
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,533
Two guys go into a bar,

104
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,666
and one has significant losses in the
upper right quadrant of his visual field.

105
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,143
The other one says you're
going to need an MRI

106
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,271
to confirm the type and
location of the tumor.

107
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,441
That readout says his vision's fine.

108
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,541
No, it doesn't.

109
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,642
Yes, it does.

110
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,949
You lied to me?

111
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,320
I kidnapped you, and you're
surprised that I lied to you?

112
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,721
It just means that the
symptoms are intermittent.

113
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,490
You come near me again,
I'm calling the police.

114
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,397
You kidnapped him?

115
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,663
It's sweet that I haven't lost
the ability to surprise you.

116
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,476
Are you mocking me?

117
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,208
My back. My back is killing me.

118
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,510
Don't care. Busy.

119
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,073
Amber's damn mattress.

120
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,711
Well, that sucks. Don't buy a new one.

121
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,887
Are you being sarcastic?
Because we are buying one.

122
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,015
She's incapable of doing
anything that matters

123
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,560
without turning it
into a zero-sum game.

124
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,823
We're buying a mattress. For us.

125
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,365
Wow, I'm faster than you right now.

126
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:56,535
It's all about her and whatever hapless
salesman wanders into her sights.

127
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:01,512
She's going to lie, steal and trade
your testes to get whatever she wants.

128
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,883
Hold on. Just got to do something
before he dials the second "one. "

129
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,055
You're going to end up
humiliated, holding her purse

130
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,896
and going home to sleep
on a new mattress you hate.

131
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,488
What the hell are you doing?

132
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,759
He needs a MRI.

133
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,067
Give me one-millimeter
slices from the cortex down.

134
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,905
Any particular reason you
decided to sedate a patient

135
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,910
for a procedure that's
completely painless?

136
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,770
Guy has a history of violent
outbursts during surgical procedures.

137
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,281
Yeah, on TV.

138
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,253
It's Evan Greer. He's the
main stud on House's soap.

139
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,618
Frontal cortex looks clean. No tumors.

140
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,817
Increase the magnification
on the occipital lobe.

141
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,257
You watch because you
like or because I like?

142
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,062
I was unemployed. I...

143
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,800
Sorry, that's not an
answer, that's an apology.

144
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,599
If we are ever to come out of the
darkness, we have to be proud...

145
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,868
Occipital, frontal and temporal lobes
are clean, so is the optic nerve.

146
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,771
Definitely no tumors.

147
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,800
He's fine?

148
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,312
And awake.

149
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,484
What should we tell him?

150
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,215
See if you can talk him out of suing me.

151
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,784
He kidnapped me! He drugged me!

152
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,624
Perhaps you should go out the back way.

153
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,623
I'm not going anywhere
you people tell me to go.

154
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,563
It's just someone of your
fame... I figured fans...

155
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,969
You're trying to hide me. You
don't want me making a scene.

156
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,667
The hospital is being inspected today.

157
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,402
And you want me to do you a favor?

158
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,638
Not us, our dean of
medicine. And House hates her.

159
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,204
You'd be doing House
a favor by complaining.

160
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,306
Oh.

161
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,686
This hospital is staffed
with lunatics and criminals.

162
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,986
Excuse me, where is Dr. Cuddy?

163
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,582
You okay?

164
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,491
It's my foot. What did he do to me?

165
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,551
What did House do?

166
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,291
Nothing. I was with him the whole time.

167
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,196
It's numb. I can't feel it.

168
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,271
I can't walk.

169
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,778
Foot numbness has a huge differential.

170
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:20,580
That gets a lot narrower when you
add in peripheral-vision problems.

171
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,415
Which gets a lot wider when there's
no proof he ever had a vision problem.

172
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,956
So House was wrong
about the first symptom,

173
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,457
but the guy just happened to develop

174
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,858
a second, unrelated
symptom a few hours later?

175
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,454
He already kidnapped and
sedated the guy against his will.

176
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,898
Makes sense he'd also do something
to numb his foot so he couldn't leave.

177
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,062
But it doesn't make sense to
include a symptom that he caused

178
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,470
in a differential he's
so desperate to solve.

179
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,201
Unless he didn't mean to cause it.

180
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,608
Stick to the filing, sweetheart.
Let the doctors do the doctoring.

181
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,339
Either toxins or vitamin deficiency...

182
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,438
I'm guessing, when you drugged him,

183
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,880
you didn't catch him and
ease him to the floor.

184
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,075
He could've pinched a nerve
in his ankle when he fell.

185
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,781
You need to run an EMG test
for motor nerve entrapment

186
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,050
or the inspector will own your ass.

187
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,889
Kutner, leave the room, wait 30 minutes,

188
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,294
come back and tell her
the test was negative.

189
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,992
Is it okay if I use
that time to do the test?

190
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,557
Get out of here.

191
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,160
And the rest of them can
help me with all this stuff.

192
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,569
They're busy, which is really annoying,

193
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,665
because I wanted to be able
to say that they're busy

194
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,835
for no other reason
than to screw with you.

195
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,673
Research.

196
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,116
So the nut job was right?

197
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,252
Usually is.

198
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,316
He said I was dying.

199
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,988
He's wrong a lot, too.
That's why we do these tests.

200
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,655
Bet it's cool, you know, being
the star of a hit TV show?

201
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,162
It's a daytime soap. It pretty much
puts me one step above dinner theater.

202
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,032
Come on, you're on TV every day.

203
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,163
And who cares what the critics
think? Women love soaps.

204
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,835
You get to take pride in your job,
feel good when you go home at night.

205
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,072
You're entertaining people.

206
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,171
I don't care.

207
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,540
Then you've made a
strange career choice.

208
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,551
Look, I'm pandering.

209
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,952
I want to be part of
something that inspires people.

210
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,891
So, quit. Find something
inspiring and do it.

211
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,392
It's not that easy.

212
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,486
Why not?

213
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,832
Just isn't.

214
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,599
<i>It's my heart, Doctor. It's racing.</i>

215
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,602
<i>I'm sure it's nothing.
You're a healthy woman, Marie.</i>

216
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,206
<i>Shouldn't you examine me?</i>

217
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,872
<i>Why don't you have Rico do it?</i>

218
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,010
You can't tell me you
didn't notice that pause.

219
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,580
Sorry.

220
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,689
<i>She's never waking up.</i>

221
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,250
This is a whole new
experience in super hi-def.

222
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
I had no idea Marie wore an underwire.

223
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,854
It does sound a little forced.

224
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,196
Could be stiffening in his tongue,
which is a symptom of myxedema.

225
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:54,228
It's not the tongue. It's the dialogue.
I think I dated that nurse, though.

226
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,233
No.

227
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,276
What about the way he's
holding that stethoscope?

228
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,042
The thumb and forefinger
are meeting at an odd angle.

229
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,607
Could be a demyelination
from toxic exposure.

230
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,084
Back it up.

231
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,019
What's this, the AV Club?

232
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,650
It's diagnostic.
Everything's under control.

233
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,786
Yeah, excellent job
so far. House, outside.

234
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,664
Keep watching.

235
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,100
You'll never guess what
Rico's got in that box.

236
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,662
<i>Rico doesn't even know I'm alive.</i>

237
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,675
You have an obsession with an actor or
the character he plays. I feel for you.

238
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,268
You need to work it out.
But I need you to do it

239
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:38,146
when the hospital's accreditation,
and my job, are not on the line.

240
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,243
You want the star of the hottest daytime
drama on TV to die in your hospital?

241
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,155
No, I want you to cure him without
committing any more felonies.

242
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,250
I can't do my job if you're
going to tie my hands like that.

243
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,659
Fifty-one weeks out of the year,

244
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,665
I let you run around like a
monkey in a banana factory.

245
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,702
All I'm just asking is that
you tone it down for a few days.

246
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,267
I want that TV.

247
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,534
We're not bargaining.

248
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,269
You want something. Either you're
bargaining or you're begging.

249
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,209
Me keeping my job is good for you.

250
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,440
Yes, but it's better for you.

251
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,045
I just want us to be equally happy.

252
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,951
EMG was negative for nerve entrapment.
Means the foot's a real symptom.

253
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,511
It could be vitamin deficiency.

254
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,612
Or a toxin.

255
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,158
Or atherosclerosis.

256
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,284
Or a toxin.

257
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,055
Why is toxin a better idea?

258
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,495
Might not be. We'll know after I'm
finished searching his set and dressing room

259
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,534
for medically relevant stuff.

260
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,936
Got to go. Need a decision.

261
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,063
You're not going to cut your own throat.

262
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,164
Yeah, that sounds like me.

263
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,736
Test for heavy metals, organics,
bio toxins, and search the home.

264
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,846
I liked the pillow-top.

265
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,148
I like this one.

266
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,048
Great taste. That
model's top-of-the-line.

267
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,319
How much is it?

268
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,884
$1,999. It's a great price.

269
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,518
And what about...

270
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,962
That's too rich for us.

271
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,191
I don't know. You think...

272
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,397
Honey, we can't afford that,
not with a baby on the way.

273
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,099
Congratulations. Your first?

274
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,233
Yes.

275
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,608
How about I knock 100 bucks off,
maybe throw in free delivery.

276
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,578
Money's really tight right now.

277
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,276
I'm a law clerk, and my
husband just got laid off.

278
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,320
He has an interview
today. Wish him luck.

279
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,588
Good luck.

280
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,817
Fingers crossed.

281
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,893
We might be able to afford $1,500.

282
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,294
I'd have to check with my manager.

283
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,831
Thanks. I appreciate it.

284
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,666
Hold this, would you?

285
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,242
911 from work. I better go.

286
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,778
So, am I getting the hard mattress or
do I have to go to my job interview?

287
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,279
Whatever mattress you
want. I'm fine either way.

288
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,611
You... Really?

289
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,417
Really. Just as long as I
get to help you break it in.

290
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,631
Pack your manhood on ice, maybe
the hospital can re-attach it.

291
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,270
You were so wrong.
She's letting me choose.

292
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,712
"You choose" does not mean you choose.

293
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,612
<i>Really? It sounded like "You choose. "</i>

294
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:29,177
I suppose it's possible she
meant "House is so, so wrong. "

295
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:34,726
It's a trap. It means, "If you love
me, you'll buy the one I want. "

296
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,852
Amber doesn't do passive-aggressive.

297
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,691
People who do aggressive
don't like to limit themselves.

298
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,891
Could a leaky space heater cause
vision problems and numbness?

299
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,870
He'd have gotten better at
the hospital. It's not a trap.

300
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,463
Did I hear a question mark
at the end of that sentence?

301
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,909
<i>House, look. She's...</i>

302
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,308
Got to go.

303
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,971
Manager says I can do that price.

304
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,385
The gin bottles are all gifts from fans.

305
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,582
Brock Sterling drinks on the show,
but Evan doesn't drink at all.

306
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,354
He's on this whole health
kick right now. Fruits, nuts...

307
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,226
Did you take those
from his dressing room?

308
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,388
No.

309
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,234
You're not going to
marry Brock, are you?

310
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,395
We've been waiting four years for
him to make it official with Anna.

311
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,068
Are you really a doctor?

312
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,905
Glioblastoma. Need more proof?

313
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,078
So, no toxins on the set.
What about his regular life?

314
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,547
Unusual hobbies? Unsavory friends?

315
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,882
No, I've been out with him.
He's as vanilla as they come.

316
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,443
And by "out" you mean...

317
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,622
Well, I asked him on a date last month.

318
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,557
We went out a few times, but
we weren't right for each other.

319
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,424
Too small or too large?

320
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:47,323
Is that medically relevant?

321
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,095
I'm a doctor, and it's
relevant to me, so, yes.

322
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,393
We never got that far.

323
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,770
We made out awhile, then
he said he should go home.

324
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,642
He's a real gentleman.

325
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,108
Now, that'd be interesting.

326
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,978
He's impotent.

327
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,257
A steady diet of sunflower
seeds causes a B6 toxicity,

328
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:19,161
which causes autonomic dysregulation,
which causes a wood-free existence.

329
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,425
One bad night and a
couple of sunflower seeds

330
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,195
and he's got autonomic dysregulation?

331
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,360
It's more than just one.

332
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,304
He can't even remember the last time
he was able to salute. It's cool, huh?

333
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,638
B6 wouldn't show up on a tox screen,
and we didn't find anything at the house.

334
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,303
So, all we have to do is
filter the B6 out of his blood.

335
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,846
Prep him for plasmapheresis.

336
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,883
Just because he didn't
salute doesn't mean he can't.

337
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,377
Can you find out where
that voice keeps coming from

338
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,785
and tell it to get out of my head?

339
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,654
The impotence could be psychological.
He's depressed, hates his job...

340
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,283
Plasmapheresis has risks.

341
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,193
He should spend a night in the sleep
lab, see if he gets a reflex erection.

342
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,230
Confirmation is for
wimps and altar boys.

343
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,459
We don't need to wait for a reflex.

344
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:02,735
If he can't get engorged the way God
intended, then he can't get engorged.

345
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,342
I'm not showing him my boobs.

346
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,540
Lack of response to your
chest tells us nothing.

347
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,672
Thirteen, show him...

348
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,709
Where can I find a decent
set of knockers around here?

349
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,354
Your porn's in the second drawer.

350
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:26,327
All set. Heart monitor, blood-pressure
monitor, and the one on his junk.

351
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,201
This is humiliating.

352
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,260
<i>We're going to close the
blinds to give you some privacy.</i>

353
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,896
<i>The instruments will let
us monitor your response.</i>

354
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,939
I don't get this guy. He has the coolest
gig ever, but he's miserable about it.

355
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,772
Probably figures quitting
won't do him any good.

356
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,369
Figures he'd be unhappy anywhere.

357
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,914
Our circumstances
affect whether we're...

358
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,177
You're pretty happy in this job, right?

359
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,275
Sure.

360
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,752
Have you ever had a job
where you were miserable?

361
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,415
I once sold men's fragrances
in a department store.

362
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,424
And were you miserable?

363
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,953
The pay was awful.

364
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,188
It was a miserable job,
but you weren't miserable.

365
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,129
So, what about you? Are you happy?

366
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,635
Not particularly.

367
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,396
Heart rate and BP are climbing.

368
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,702
Got some activity on the
tumescence monitor, too.

369
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:13,370
There's nothing wrong with his
naughty. It's not B6 toxicity.

370
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,084
Did he just finish?

371
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,952
Sometimes when you haven't,
you know, for a while...

372
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,890
His heart rate is through
the roof. 220 and climbing.

373
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,990
He's headed for cardiac arrest.

374
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,900
We shocked his heart
back into sinus rhythm.

375
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,601
He's stable, at least for now.

376
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,870
Could be some sort of
atypical septic reaction.

377
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,002
Not without a fever.

378
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,944
Thus the word "atypical. "

379
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,478
In that case, it could
be an atypical bunion.

380
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,950
He used to smoke. Could be paraneoplastic
syndrome caused by small-cell lung cancer.

381
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,453
He quit 20 years ago, and
his calcium levels are normal.

382
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,648
Could be Graves' Disease.

383
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,622
Extreme hyperthyroidism
leads to systemic problems,

384
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,661
including numbness, vision
loss and cardiac arrest.

385
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,959
You want to be here.

386
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,232
I have to be here.

387
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,326
Just say the word. I'll fire Thirteen.

388
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,994
Just sign the forms.

389
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,429
Smart move. I was bluffing.

390
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,138
She's right. We should fry the
thyroid before it fries him.

391
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,174
I know it's more exciting this way,
but shouldn't we confirm you're right

392
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,253
before destroying one of the
most important glands in his body?

393
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,289
If that gland has drawn a
bull's-eye on his heart, then, no.

394
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:35,759
Nuking his thyroid puts him at risk for
vascular lesions and all kinds of cancer.

395
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,125
Protocol says we should
do an iodine uptake test.

396
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,464
We?

397
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,824
Anyone else want to run a useless test

398
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,199
while Brock's thyroid
plots its next lethal move?

399
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,839
It was rhetorical.

400
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,342
You were sure about B6 toxicity, too.

401
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,707
House is right.

402
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,343
Seriously? I mean, I
am, but you think so?

403
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,484
If he goes into full-on
thyroid storm, he'll die.

404
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,351
We got to nuke his thyroid.

405
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,031
Hang up the phone.

406
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,466
Why? If we're going
to nuke his thyroid...

407
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,801
We're not nuking the guy's thyroid
without proof that it's Graves'.

408
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,533
Do the iodine uptake test.

409
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,632
If House finds out...
When House finds out...

410
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,143
We'll have the test results.

411
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,339
And we'll either do his
procedure or we won't.

412
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,128
What are you doing here?

413
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,493
Just grabbing a snack.

414
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,329
You keep food in the morgue?

415
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,561
If I keep it in the lounge,
everyone else eats it.

416
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,700
That's because it's
everyone else's food.

417
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,670
I thought it was just
everyone else's bags.

418
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,542
The Accreditation Board will
light us on fire for this.

419
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,842
They're not going to find out.

420
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:07,613
Unless, of course, Conway planned on
inspecting the morgue in, say, two minutes.

421
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,451
Is that why you're here?

422
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,887
You're going to get me
fired over a sandwich?

423
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,156
No, over a TV. And you're not going to
get fired because you're going to fold.

424
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,786
No, I won't.

425
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,957
But you're going to push
it, so we need a safe word,

426
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,803
so you can signal your
unconditional surrender.

427
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:30,605
Call me "sweet sauce. " Dr.
House. I don't think we've met.

428
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,143
Dr. Jamie Conway. I've heard your name.

429
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,475
Most people have. It's also a noun.

430
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:42,283
I sometimes come down here to
relax, unwind, maybe grab a...

431
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,753
Sweet sauce.

432
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,149
It's a nickname.

433
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,453
An ironic nickname.

434
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,920
Wow, it is almost 2:00.
Aren't you supposed to be...

435
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,367
Oh, yeah. Yeah, 'cause those sick blind
kids aren't going to read to themselves.

436
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,434
See you.

437
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:15,547
I recommend skipping C26. Floater,
been in the river at least a week.

438
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,050
Thanks for the warning. Any time.

439
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,662
Doesn't the doctors'
lounge have that same TV?

440
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:35,967
No, they've got a 12-inch exactly
like the one that used to be in here.

441
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,972
Your files are done.

442
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,271
I'll be doing a dance of joy
just as soon as my leg is healed.

443
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,847
Can you tilt it down?

444
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,246
I know the paperwork annoys you,

445
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,615
but patient records are important.
You can't just let them sit there.

446
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,445
I had to, in the name of science.

447
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,721
I let the crap pile up,

448
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,091
then I see which team member
is most self-flagellating.

449
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,561
Breaks down, clears up the mess.

450
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,057
Surprise was, it turned
out to be you again.

451
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,270
You weren't even
registered as a competitor.

452
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,865
You miss me. You miss me.

453
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,008
You hired Thirteen to replace...

454
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,807
Yeah, all pretty girls are fungible.

455
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,470
You're avoiding.

456
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:22,211
I miss the job. I miss running
around playing private investigator.

457
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,756
I miss the puzzles.

458
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,158
Seriously, I'll fire Thirteen.

459
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,563
Or Kutner, if you think Thirteen is hot.

460
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,660
I don't miss you.

461
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,130
That iodine left a
really weird aftertaste.

462
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,175
That's the tracer in it. We'll
have the images in a couple minutes.

463
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,645
You must do okay with women, huh?

464
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,510
I already asked him that.

465
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,575
And?

466
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,451
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

467
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,817
He feels unfulfilled.

468
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,014
I doubt it.

469
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,920
I'm lying?

470
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,627
I used to be a plastic surgeon.

471
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,955
I'd talk about my work as
shallow and meaningless.

472
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:12,635
Truth is, I loved every
boob job, every tummy tuck.

473
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,570
Meaning doesn't mean that much.

474
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,004
But you're not a
plastic surgeon anymore.

475
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,536
It's complicated.

476
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,672
Are you happier?

477
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,242
It's complicated.

478
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,479
His thyroid looks normal.

479
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,913
So, that's good news, right?

480
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,321
Everything look too bright to you?

481
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,484
It could be the monitor.

482
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,761
It's not the monitor. It's the iodine.

483
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,896
It's everywhere. His
body's not filtering it.

484
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,438
His kidneys are failing.

485
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,706
I told you to nuke his thyroid.

486
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,771
It's a good thing we didn't. Kidney
failure means it wasn't Graves'.

487
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:01,909
So, your test screwed me
and our patient's kidneys.

488
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,385
You practically
poisoned him with iodine.

489
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,447
Which he could have handled
easily if his kidneys were healthy.

490
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,459
All we did was reveal a new
symptom. Usually you're all for that.

491
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,927
It must be the rancid tinge
of betrayal that's put me off.

492
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,123
You were wrong.

493
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,893
So, tell me to my face.

494
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,666
You've never hesitated before. The
board's turning you into a coward.

495
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,635
I did it because it was
the right thing to do.

496
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,002
You did it to pass an inspection.

497
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,734
Does it matter?

498
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,642
Kidney failure on top of the other
symptoms points to an autoimmune condition,

499
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,943
which means that any of his
other organs could be next.

500
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,819
We've already started dialysis. We
need to run ANA's for autoimmune.

501
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,280
You're right. You and the
team go measure the ceilings.

502
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,250
Excuse me?

503
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,192
Accreditation Board
guidelines state that

504
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,196
no object can be less than
18 inches from the ceiling.

505
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,424
Make sure we're in compliance.

506
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,365
There's nothing in our
office that would be less...

507
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,959
I don't mean us. I
mean the whole hospital.

508
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,643
Let's see how this baby handles.

509
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:17,489
What?

510
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,029
You bought the firm mattress.

511
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,390
I thought that's the one you wanted.

512
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,866
It was.

513
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,102
Why would you do that?

514
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,195
Because...

515
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,308
Is this a trick question?

516
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,604
I left it up to you.

517
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,911
You were supposed to
get the one you wanted.

518
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,775
I got the one you wanted
because I love you.

519
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,942
No.

520
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,086
You did it because that's what you do.

521
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,218
With all your ex-wives,
you did whatever they wanted

522
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,196
because it was easier, and
you ended up resenting them.

523
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,199
Don't you dare do that to me.

524
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,363
What, take care of you?

525
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,232
Have you met me?

526
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,639
I can take care of me.

527
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,301
I need you to take care of you.

528
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,545
I have work to do.

529
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,086
You made it to page eight.

530
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,559
"Mysterious Hospital
Visit for Soap Doc. "

531
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,060
Wow, I'll be sure to send my mom a copy.

532
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,002
They told me I have
an autoimmune disease,

533
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,767
like Lupus or Sarcoidosis.

534
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,676
That's what we're here to find out.

535
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,845
You really as good as everyone
seems to think you are?

536
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:51,047
Are you really as miserable as
everyone seems to think you are?

537
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:55,024
I just want to do
something that matters.

538
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,856
Nothing matters.

539
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:04,128
We're all just cockroaches,
wildebeests dying on the riverbank.

540
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,504
Nothing we do has any lasting meaning.

541
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,665
And you think I'm miserable?

542
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,835
If you're unhappy on the
plane, jump out of it.

543
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,509
I want to,

544
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:17,874
but I can't.

545
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,214
That's the problem with metaphors.
They need interpretation.

546
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,724
Jumping out of the plane is stupid.

547
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,158
But what if I'm not in a plane?

548
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,589
What if I'm just in a
place I don't want to be?

549
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,831
That's the other problem with metaphors.

550
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,200
Yes, what if you're actually
in an ice cream truck,

551
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,671
and outside are candy
and flowers and virgins?

552
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,938
You're on a plane. We're all on planes.

553
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:52,574
Life is dangerous and complicated,
and it's a long way down.

554
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,686
So, you're afraid to change?

555
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,389
No, you're afraid to change.

556
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:05,324
You'd rather imagine that you can
escape, instead of actually try,

557
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,431
because if you fail, you've got nothing.

558
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,631
So, you'll give up the
chance at something real,

559
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,569
so you that can hold on to hope.

560
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,834
Thing is, hope is for sissies.

561
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,507
When I get out of here, I'm
not going to be afraid anymore.

562
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,186
I mean, how many guys
get a second chance?

563
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:36,192
Too many. Half the people I save
don't deserve a second chance.

564
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,593
Now that I've got mine, I'm
going to set things right.

565
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:45,666
I'm going to start by being a better
father to you and to your sister.

566
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,303
And to your other sister.
And to your other sister.

567
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,339
You realize you're reciting
lines from last season?

568
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:56,277
We're going to do all
the things I promised.

569
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,980
Just help me get out of this bed.

570
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,818
Cooling blankets in here. This
guy's brain is about to boil.

571
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,396
Do you know where you
are? What's your name?

572
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,495
Dr. Brock Sterling.

573
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,240
Fever rules out autoimmune. He's
septic. He's got a massive infection.

574
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,972
We've got him on
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

575
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,570
but he's slipped from
delirium into a coma.

576
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:34,140
Good news is last time Brock was
in a coma, he fathered two children.

577
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,653
We need to identify the infection and
get him on more targeted meds fast.

578
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,019
What about pneumococcus? Causes
heart problems and sepsis.

579
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,752
But not the neuropathies in his foot
and eyes. What about tetanus? It fits.

580
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,455
He got a tetanus booster
last year. Lyme disease?

581
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,690
He would have been sore all over.

582
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,425
There's a thousand infections
that could have caused this.

583
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,935
We can start testing, but he'll
be dead before the cultures grow.

584
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:56,463
Unless it's a fungus. We could
see that under a microscope.

585
00:32:56,541 --> 00:33:00,136
Test for fungi, parasites,
all creatures great and small.

586
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,838
Where are you going?

587
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,904
To lie down. I need to think.

588
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:12,682
Could be rat bite fever, but
his glands aren't swollen.

589
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,487
Which one are you going to get?

590
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,797
She told me to get the one I want.

591
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:20,922
So get it.

592
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:26,895
Listeria explains the sepsis,
possibly also the heart problem.

593
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,563
But not the numbness.

594
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,276
If the listeria caused encephalomyelitis,
which then caused the numbness...

595
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,408
I want a waterbed.

596
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,751
Wow.

597
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:48,019
I've always wanted one. I
know it's ridiculous, it's just

598
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:51,858
there's something nice about the thought
of being rocked to sleep in water.

599
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,464
No mocking? No Freudian
analysis of how the waterbed

600
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,766
is really a great big
vagina I want to crawl into?

601
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,701
I'm ignoring you
because you make me sad.

602
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,072
He's on ampicillin, which
means if it was listeria,

603
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,579
he would've shown some improvement.

604
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:13,947
No, it's a whole thing. You need
special sheets and insurance and...

605
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,579
Who cares? You wanted
one your whole life.

606
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,818
You're a grown-up. You can
afford it. Stores sell them.

607
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,450
Most adults don't go through
life like you do, House,

608
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,359
indulging our every whim.

609
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,664
Then you don't deserve to be happy.

610
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,596
And yet I am. You?

611
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,808
Amber will think it's stupid.

612
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,546
It is stupid.

613
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,653
Live the dream, Wilson.

614
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,027
It's not an infection. It's an allergy.

615
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,222
That's why it's not
responding to antibiotics.

616
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,662
This isn't a soap opera, House.

617
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,826
People don't just wake up from
comas the second you give them drugs.

618
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,962
Especially if we give them the
wrong drugs. What do the tests say?

619
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,405
It was negative for fungus and
parasites, but that doesn't mean...

620
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,568
The more infections we rule out, the more
likely it is that it's not an infection.

621
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,738
He has no history of allergies
or asthma. Most importantly,

622
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,544
none of his symptoms remotely
resemble an allergic reaction.

623
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,175
Allergens could trigger
an allergic vasculitis.

624
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,413
That would explain the symptoms.

625
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,750
One in a million times.

626
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,756
Septic infection always
explains his symptoms.

627
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,691
But an infection is never
resistant to every antibiotic.

628
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,193
No, an infection is rarely resistant.

629
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:36,528
And allergy never responds to antibiotics.
"Never" beats "rarely. " QED, I win.

630
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,501
There were chrysanthemums
in his dressing room.

631
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,935
My God, why didn't you say
he'd been exposed to plant life?

632
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:45,031
Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrin.
It's a neurotoxin and a known allergen.

633
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,545
He has an infection. If we give
him steroids, we'll kill him.

634
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,081
He has an allergy. If we don't
give him steroids, we'll kill him.

635
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,171
Not as fast.

636
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,444
Fast enough.

637
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,576
You don't have time for the rest of
the tests. We have to do something.

638
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,120
And what we're doing
right now isn't working.

639
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,819
Hundred milligrams methylprednisolone.

640
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,452
Patients' names?

641
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,088
It's one patient.

642
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,965
You want to give one patient 100
milligrams? That'll jump-start a car.

643
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,094
Perfect, my patient's a '69 Ford Coma.

644
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,640
Anything over 50 milligrams, I
need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy.

645
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,800
It's protocol, and the inspector's here.

646
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,402
I am 99% certain that she'll consent.

647
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,142
But for the sake of the
1%, why don't I just...

648
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,279
You're not allowed back here.

649
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,751
Well, tell the inspector
he can put it on my tab.

650
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,020
I didn't mean now.

651
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:51,072
100 milligrams of
methylprednisolone is an overdose.

652
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,904
We were wrong about the infection.

653
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,171
He's suffering from a
severe allergic reaction.

654
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,737
The team hasn't finished
the test for allergy.

655
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:58,837
His symptoms don't...

656
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,543
In rare cases...

657
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,512
Trust me, at the end of
this conversation, I'm right.

658
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,079
Then confirm it. Get a blood test.

659
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,626
What is it about this
severe and deepening coma

660
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,251
that makes you think we've
got time for protocol?

661
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,091
Protocol has saved your
patient from having his

662
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,462
thyroid destroyed and his blood drained.

663
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:21,103
If you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm
wrong. Don't talk about protocol.

664
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,038
My job's on the line.
Your job is on the line.

665
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,644
Okay, here's what you do.

666
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,909
You wait three minutes,
then you call security.

667
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,424
By the time they get in here
to lock me up, I'll be done.

668
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,551
He gets to live. Your
ass gets to be covered.

669
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:54,468
If he dies, let me know,
so I can pack my things.

670
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:49,459
Tests are negative. Patient's
negative for all floral allergies.

671
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,859
I'm going to restart the antibiotics.

672
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,367
If he's still alive.

673
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,246
Ampicillin, two grams, IV.

674
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,346
Why? The steroids
worked. House was right.

675
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,445
The test was negative.

676
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,819
He was still right.

677
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,657
It was an allergy.

678
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,092
To what?

679
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,228
Thank you.

680
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,768
I was wrong.

681
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,529
You should have stopped me.

682
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,937
Heard about House's patient. Bold move.

683
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,544
And you backed him.

684
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:48,710
He was right.

685
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,182
He wasn't even in the
same neighborhood as right.

686
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,280
The patient's alive.

687
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,225
Okay, the rules exist
because 95% of the time,

688
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,728
for 95% of people, they're
the right thing to do.

689
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,765
And the other 5%?

690
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,527
Have to live by the same rules.

691
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:07,068
Because everybody thinks
they're in that 5%.

692
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,431
Okay.

693
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,737
I noticed that Dr. Chase...

694
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,160
What are you doing out here?

695
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,097
I can't sleep. I hate the waterbed.

696
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,269
I actually kind of like it.

697
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,176
No, it's awful.

698
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,976
We're returning it tomorrow.

699
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,512
Okay.

700
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,528
I'm glad you got it, though.

701
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,129
Me, too.

702
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,503
I hope they'll take it back.

703
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,143
They will.

704
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,345
<i>You promised me you'd stop drinking.</i>

705
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:36,349
<i>Of course I'm drunk, Anna. They told
me you'd never wake up from that coma.</i>

706
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,555
<i>But how could you get
engaged to my sister?</i>

707
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,730
<i>We fell in love.</i>

708
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,763
<i>What do you want from
me, Anna? I'm just a man.</i>

709
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,201
<i>And I'm just a woman.</i>

710
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,540
<i>And as thrilled as I am
about The Lady Slipper being</i>

711
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,672
<i>the best nightclub Port
Lawrence has ever seen...</i>

712
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,390
<i>Hello. Don't hang up.</i>

713
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,462
What was the verdict?

714
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,868
$200,000 fine.

715
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,738
You should have been fired.

716
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:24,831
Good night, House.

717
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,900
There are bubbles in his glass.

718
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,205
Can this wait until...

719
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,873
My patient. He's allergic to quinine.

720
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,312
And you got this from bubbles?

721
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,149
<i>His symptoms started two months ago.</i>

722
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:42,958
That's also when Brock started downing gin
and tonics like a Brit staving off malaria.

723
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,757
Gin was fake, the tonic was real.

724
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:50,423
And tonic water is loaded with quinine.

725
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,497
Nice job.

726
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,637
You should have been fired.

727
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,104
I'm taking back the TV.

728
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,334
I saved his life.

729
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,500
That wasn't the deal.

730
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,977
The contract clearly
stated no takesie-backsies.

731
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,576
Good night, House.

732
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:05,945
What are you wearing?

733
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,781
Good night, House.

734
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,341
Good night, Cuddy.

9999
