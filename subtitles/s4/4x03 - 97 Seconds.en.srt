1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,062
There were some nice guys there,

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:09,405
but they're all so quiet,
awkward smiles and sweaty palms.

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,468
I'm not expecting Brad Pitt
to walk into St. Theresa's,

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:18,484
just someone who makes me laugh,
has a nice smile, full head of hair.

5
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,418
You know, someone
like you, Mr. Franklin.

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,883
It's a shame they're
going to cremate you.

7
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,580
Can I help you?

8
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,920
Martin!

9
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,096
Martin!

10
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,301
My purse is right there. Go
ahead, take whatever you want.

11
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,229
Irene, you call me?

12
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,070
Irene?

13
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,504
Irene!

14
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,790
How are you doing?

15
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,326
I'm fine.

16
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,460
FYI, if you ask me, it's more
the guys' fault than yours.

17
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,557
And House isn't blameless, either.

18
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,398
If he hadn't pitted us
all against each other...

19
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,234
It was my fault. My mistake.

20
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,938
Was that always there?

21
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,642
Hello?

22
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,277
Sure.

23
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,586
It's House.

24
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,784
<i>Good morning, angels.</i>

25
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,260
<i>As you will see from the file, we
have quite the interesting case.</i>

26
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,765
<i>It's not often you get a
patient who sees dead people.</i>

27
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,265
What file?

28
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,628
What the hell?

29
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,330
I gave it to Bosley a half-hour ago.

30
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,201
It was not a half-hour,
it was 10 minutes.

31
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,299
And he made copies of
the ER records first.

32
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,843
Less lip, more whip.

33
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,175
I only agreed to take this case

34
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,341
because you said that this mocha
frapalicious would have whip on it.

35
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,282
Fine. I'll refer the case to Foreman.

36
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,719
Can't. Mercy fired him.

37
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:43,948
Gimme. He got fired?

38
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,220
He disobeyed a superior officer under
fire. He's lucky he wasn't executed.

39
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,295
How do you know about it?
You keeping tabs on him?

40
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,954
Girls talk.

41
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,456
When Bosley drags his
ancient ass in there...

42
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,331
I'm here.

43
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:01,533
Twenty-four year old funeral cosmetician
suffered a grand mal seizure at work.

44
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,903
Why does he get to be Bosley?

45
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,842
You want to be Bosley? Bosley's,
like, the asexual messenger boy.

46
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,814
She had a vision of being raped
by a cadaver before passing out.

47
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,373
Seizure rules out psychiatric illness.

48
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,045
No history of epilepsy,
head trauma or drug use.

49
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,987
Bosley keeps his job while they
replace five angels over three seasons.

50
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,524
Could be a tumor to the temporal lobe.

51
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,923
Not with a normal CT scan.

52
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,052
You mean, it appeared
normal to the doc in the ER.

53
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,528
Way to get right back
on that horse, Thirteen.

54
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,622
No, that was Amber.

55
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,564
<i>Nice try, Cutthroat Bitch.</i>

56
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,195
<i>That was the worst Thirteen
imitation I've ever heard.</i>

57
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,739
Funeral home prep rooms are
filled with toxic chemicals.

58
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,775
And cadavers. Everybody in that
place obviously died from something.

59
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,276
I have a question. Is he
the one who's not a doctor?

60
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,075
Bullets aren't contagious,
but infections, parasites...

61
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:46,084
You said one of us wasn't a
doctor, and you called him a fraud.

62
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,882
<i>He's not a doctor. Continue, Bos.</i>

63
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,646
Could be an STD.

64
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,020
Why isn't he fired?

65
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,752
You're breaking up.

66
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,293
<i>Going into a tunnel.</i>

67
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,989
Dark Religious Nut.

68
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,223
What did you call me?

69
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,288
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

70
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,334
<i>What do you people want
to be called this week?</i>

71
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,494
Cole.

72
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,468
No, I'm never gonna remember that.

73
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,404
<i>Take Bosley and the other visible
minority to the funeral home.</i>

74
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,307
<i>The rest of you young, white
people, the world is your oyster.</i>

75
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,903
<i>Do an MRI with contrast,
EEG, LP and a blood panel.</i>

76
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,176
And, angels, be careful.

77
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,519
Just because he's religious,
doesn't mean he won't kick your ass.

78
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,921
You want to bet? No.

79
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,086
I want you to stop
being such a jerk to him.

80
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,022
$100.

81
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,636
Smart call. The guy's a wuss.

82
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,536
He'll be the next one on the train.

83
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,198
Define "kick your ass. "

84
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,900
Any physical confrontation?

85
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,204
Or verbal?

86
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,300
Define verbal.

87
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,711
Anything over 70 decibels.

88
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,874
And you can't start
suddenly being nice to him.

89
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,541
You realize what
you're encouraging here.

90
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,052
Yeah. Someone kicking your ass.

91
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,460
The space inside is
smaller than I thought.

92
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,790
Don't worry, Reena.

93
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,457
The doctors are gonna take
good care of you, right?

94
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,523
Once the Valium kicks
in you'll feel better.

95
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,001
And then we'll have some nice,
warm milk when you're done.

96
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,265
I'd rather have more Valium.

97
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,237
Oh, Reena!

98
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,740
Let's wait just a bit, see how it goes.

99
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,243
Try to lie as still as possible.

100
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,346
Guess Father Time's a
lock for one of the spots.

101
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,976
Thirteen's a lock.

102
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,248
He doesn't have a medical
license and he's still around.

103
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,722
She killed a guy in a
wheelchair and his dog.

104
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,090
He doesn't care about our
qualifications, our ideas,

105
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,992
he just wants to have fun.

106
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,999
And she's the ultimate fun,
because he can't figure her out.

107
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,466
This game is insane.

108
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,765
So quit. Happy to lose the competition.

109
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,705
If it's gonna be on your résumé, it's
got to be better to quit than get fired.

110
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,835
Either quit or shut up.

111
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,581
Actually, with House, getting
fired might look better.

112
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,078
Dr. House is a dangerous egomaniac.

113
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,126
That's why I left. We had
different ideas on how to practice.

114
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,060
Glad to hear it. Tell me about Mercy.

115
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,065
To be honest, I don't think Dr.
Schaffer really gave me a chance.

116
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,930
Obviously not. You were
there for three weeks.

117
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,696
What happened?

118
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,362
I saved a patient's life.

119
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,806
That's usually not
grounds for dismissal.

120
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,171
Have you spoken to her?

121
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,710
Yes.

122
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,268
Then why are you
asking me what happened?

123
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,904
You have an excellent résumé.

124
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,916
I felt I owed it to you to
hear what you had to say.

125
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,076
What did she tell you?

126
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:37,054
That you defied her instructions
and hospital procedures.

127
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,957
That's what happened, nothing
more I can add to that.

128
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,790
You could tell me that you were wrong.

129
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,063
Sounds like you didn't leave
House quite soon enough.

130
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,138
<i>Cadavers were clean, so is her food.</i>

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,006
<i>It's all organic, unprocessed crap.
It's got to be the embalming fluid.</i>

132
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,135
Ethanol can have
psychoactive effects and...

133
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,579
<i>Bosley, tell whoever's
talking that he's an idiot.</i>

134
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,678
Bosley?

135
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:12,849
<i>Either tell him he's an idiot,
or tell me why I'm wrong.</i>

136
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,983
You're an idiot.

137
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,824
You actually think that I'd take a patient
who had a seizure in a funeral home,

138
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,330
if the ER hadn't already
ruled out embalming fluid?

139
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,457
I thought we weren't
supposed to trust...

140
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,592
<i>Idiot!</i>

141
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,034
<i>From the old French, idiote,</i>

142
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,197
meaning effeminate,
mentally deficient Moor.

143
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,635
I found something in the
mortuary's files from '05.

144
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,273
A 48-year-old male's cause of
death was listed as pneumonia,

145
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,147
but the symptoms in the
autopsy report didn't fit.

146
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,880
<i>Confusion, memory loss, depression...</i>

147
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,013
Mad cow. Very cool.

148
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,889
No, she's a vegetarian and only
ate organic vegetables, at that.

149
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,224
Tell him he's an idiot again.

150
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,297
The disease can be
spread by brain tissue.

151
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,497
Which is very cool. Run with it.

152
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,967
So, because the answer might be cool,

153
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,869
you want us to do a brain
biopsy on a 24-year-old woman?

154
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,202
No, because the answer
is something cool,

155
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:07,075
I want you to do a brain biopsy
on a 48-year-old dead guy.

156
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,806
The guy's already been buried.

157
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,007
We dig him up.

158
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,516
I'm not digging up a body
without a court order.

159
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,177
<i>Don't think of it as digging up a body.</i>

160
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:17,745
Think of it as keeping
another one from being buried.

161
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,949
I can't do it.

162
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,195
Are we gonna have another one
of those ecumenical discussions

163
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,892
<i>where I tell you that your beliefs
are ridiculous and you totally cave?</i>

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,934
I just got to be home at 6:00.

165
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,094
The Sabbath.

166
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,866
The Lord works for six days, then
tells the union he needs a rest.

167
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,842
You know, if I was all-powerful I
think I'd take at least two days.

168
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,207
It's Thursday.

169
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,576
Well, then it must be the kid.

170
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,213
<i>You have oatmeal on your pants.</i>

171
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,276
Do you have a camera in here?

172
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,879
<i>Nope, I was guessing.</i>

173
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,517
<i>He had oatmeal on his pants
yesterday and the day before.</i>

174
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,585
<i>Have one of your wives
look after the spawn.</i>

175
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,957
I'm a single dad.

176
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,233
Where's the single mom?

177
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,136
I have no idea.

178
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,367
<i>Interesting.</i>

179
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,536
You claim a lapse of judgment,

180
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,911
or are you gonna admit that a lapse
in judgment is a lapse in faith?

181
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,813
He's gone.

182
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,111
<i>Fair enough.</i>

183
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,083
Family comes first.

184
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:33,493
Dr. Cuddy? I'm Amber Volakis,
one of Dr. House's new fellows.

185
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,794
Sexual harassment claims go through HR,

186
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,630
stress-related leaves
through workers comp,

187
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,967
and any accusations
of criminal activities

188
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,269
go directly to the
Princeton-Plainsboro police department.

189
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:48,279
Actually, I was wondering if you needed
any extra help in the clinic tonight.

190
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,977
You're not gonna score any points
with House by kissing my ass.

191
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,519
Understood, but I hear Dr.
House hates clinic duty.

192
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,384
If he were to hear through the grapevine
that I was willing to work overtime,

193
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,287
take some of it off his hands...
My advice to you is to do

194
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,326
whatever House wants you to do tonight.

195
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,884
And then tomorrow
night you can come back

196
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,156
and I will give you extra clinic duty.

197
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,200
Does everybody around
here have trust issues?

198
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,698
I don't know what House wants you
to do and I don't want to know.

199
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,738
But if you really have a
problem with it, quit now.

200
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,000
It's only gonna get worse.

201
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,211
All right. Who's up?

202
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,514
Not me.

203
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,849
You haven't done any digging yet.

204
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:30,980
I'm a surgeon.

205
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,991
If anything happens to
these hands, I'm screwed.

206
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,151
Let Bosley do it.

207
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,420
As long as he can keep folding laundry,

208
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,119
His career...

209
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,891
Someone's coming.

210
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,490
Hey, shouldn't we be running?

211
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,763
If it's a cop, run.

212
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,668
Security guard, I say we take him down.

213
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,142
Sorry I'm late.

214
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,275
Where the hell have you been?

215
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,409
I got lost.

216
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,511
We've been here over three hours.

217
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,112
Really lost.

218
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,384
I brought coffee and donuts.

219
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,194
So, Thirteen, you grow up around here?

220
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,693
We're digging up a grave
and you want to chit-chat?

221
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,966
I'm just making conversation.
It's what people do.

222
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,397
Why are you hiding everything?

223
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:26,206
And I'm asking you that question
because you're hiding everything.

224
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,304
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

225
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,905
I'm worried.

226
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,450
No, you're not.

227
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,816
Fine, but I am freaked, because
I don't think you're a freak.

228
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,585
I think you're doing this on purpose
because you know House will be intrigued.

229
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,623
Yeah, I grew up around here.

230
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,294
Honey, I'm home.

231
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,129
Get the crowbar.

232
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,834
No, there's not enough room to
maneuver a crowbar down here.

233
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,842
Oh, God help us.

234
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,140
What the hell?

235
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,242
What is it?

236
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,618
Ankles. They buried the
guy the wrong way around.

237
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,957
The doctors' lounge is covered in mud.

238
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,592
Thirteen and Cutthroat
Bitch had a disagreement.

239
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,829
Cafeteria was out of Jell-O.

240
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,370
There were pickaxes.

241
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,033
Either you had them dig up a body,
or you're building a railroad.

242
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,838
A little, tiny piece of
his brain. Seemed a waste.

243
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:33,969
He wasn't using it anymore.

244
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,070
That's your defense?

245
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,081
"We just dismembered him. "

246
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,947
They're looking for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

247
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,188
You get the results yet?

248
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,053
Does my breath smell bated to you?

249
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,559
Yes. Let me know when you hear anything.

250
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,187
And get that mess in the
shower area cleaned up.

251
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,856
I know just the guy.

252
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,491
How many of them agreed
to dig up a grave?

253
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,697
Six. But don't worry, the one who
didn't, didn't stand on principle.

254
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,501
He just had a diaper to change.

255
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,170
I really think there are no
bad choices in this group.

256
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:23,185
You guys don't wipe your feet
when you come in the house?

257
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,991
Doctors' lounge, let's go.

258
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,224
Why me?

259
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,527
Well, I can't ask the black guy
or one of the chicks to do it.

260
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,932
That would be insensitive.

261
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,696
And you can't ask Bosley

262
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,503
because that'd look like you only hired
the non-doctor to do non-doctor stuff.

263
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,873
You keep stalling, you're
still gonna clean up,

264
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,538
but I won't let you have the mop.

265
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,250
Sample came back negative
for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

266
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,221
Well, that discussion didn't last long.

267
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,954
I just don't know what else there is.

268
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,224
We had an idea, it was wrong.

269
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,890
Well, we could go home.

270
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,127
I mean, we have no idea
what's wrong with her,

271
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,759
which means it could
be completely benign.

272
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:09,934
Or, on the off chance that it's killing
her, we could take it again from the top.

273
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,337
You've already done everything.

274
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,438
We may have missed something.

275
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,177
I just want to go home.
I'm sure I'm fine now.

276
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,015
Reena, the doctors know best.

277
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,520
You had some serious symptoms...

278
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,455
If I have another one,
I'll come right back. Okay?

279
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,958
If you have it while you're driving...

280
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,019
You can drive me, make
sure I take it easy.

281
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,096
Who can?

282
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,467
My mother.

283
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,764
Your mother's here?

284
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,831
What are you talking
about? She's right there.

285
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,481
<i>You sampled every bodily fluid,</i>

286
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:03,893
<i>peeked in her brain, violated a
cadaver's privacy, dug up a body,</i>

287
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,554
but missed the fact

288
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:10,192
that she was still seeing
things that weren't there.

289
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,731
Neurological symptoms are getting worse.

290
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,673
It'd be nice if one of you
angelslmorons had a clue why.

291
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:22,271
We did a full history. She never mentioned
seeing or hearing anything unusual.

292
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,077
Well, as long as she never said
anything, how were you to know?

293
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,550
Same thing with the spinal
fluid? She tell you that was fine?

294
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,348
The labs were all clear.

295
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,049
Then either we're about to
meet the Alpha and Omega,

296
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,059
or you missed something.

297
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,389
We missed the new symptom.

298
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,589
It's not a new symptom. We always
knew she had hallucinations.

299
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,063
Seeing your dead
mother's a hallucination.

300
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,863
Not knowing she's dead is a delusion.

301
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,428
You keep this up, you're gonna have
to start wearing sexier clothes.

302
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,908
Carbon monoxide could also cause
delusions. A lot of haunted houses...

303
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,309
There's no headache, no tachycardia.

304
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,313
I guess they didn't cover
that at your medical school.

305
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,077
What about a hereditary
connection? I mean, she's 24.

306
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,482
Her mother died when she was 25.

307
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,646
In Ukraine, 20 years ago. Good
luck trying to get those records.

308
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,246
So we start new records.

309
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,986
Test for every hereditary
disease that fits the symptoms.

310
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,152
There are at least 40 different
mitochondrial disorders,

311
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,320
another couple hundred...

312
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,094
Start with amyloidosis and you keep
going until you reach zamyloidosis.

313
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,339
Now what are you testing for?

314
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,967
Or should I ask what
you are not testing for?

315
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,911
Well, we could narrow it down if you
could remember what your mother died from.

316
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,280
My mother is not dead.
She's sitting right there.

317
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,014
Do you think we're lying to you?

318
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,678
Leave it alone.

319
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,851
Convincing her that her mother's
dead isn't gonna make her better,

320
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,827
just miserable.

321
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,831
You lose your mother?

322
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,634
Do you think we're trying to
trick you? Why would we do that?

323
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:59,108
Because you're mean, and
you're not good at your job.

324
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,510
Reena, stop. You're being cruel.

325
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,274
They're wasting time,

326
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:07,182
doing exactly what the guy in
the wheelchair said they'd do.

327
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,781
A guy in a wheelchair was here?

328
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,346
You know who I'm talking about.

329
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,018
He's been hanging around
ever since they brought me in,

330
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,221
complaining about how
incompetent everyone is.

331
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,325
He said you killed his dog.

332
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,632
It doesn't make any sense.

333
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm not interested.

334
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,867
If you weren't interested,
you wouldn't be here.

335
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,639
I thought it was social.

336
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,806
No, you didn't. You always
think there's an agenda.

337
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,144
That's why I left.

338
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,084
That's why you're good.

339
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,154
You need a job. I'll find a job.

340
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,849
I need someone that understands House.

341
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:45,912
They'll learn.

342
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,686
I need someone that can control House.

343
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,057
Keep looking. It might take a while.

344
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,900
I'll cut the salary of
everyone else on the team 15%,

345
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,435
give it to you.

346
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,335
That's more than you'll
get anywhere else.

347
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,372
What does House say about this?

348
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,707
You're the one person on the
team that he always respected.

349
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,111
This restaurant is 20 minutes out of
your way, half an hour out of mine.

350
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,481
You picked it to make sure
House didn't drop in on us.

351
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,383
It's my decision, not his.

352
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,152
You tell him that, then run back to
your office while I get to deal with him.

353
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,726
I left for a reason.

354
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,988
That reason hasn't changed.

355
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,462
So,

356
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,233
what's the news?

357
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,643
Everything's negative so far.

358
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,645
Yes. Why wait to finish
before reporting to me?

359
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,941
I have things to do, you know.

360
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,380
She's seeing someone else.

361
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:48,112
That's not news, that's olds.

362
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,315
Damn it. Why did God design
the human body this way?

363
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,515
A guy in a wheelchair.

364
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,286
In a hospital? That's enough
to give you the heebie-jeebies.

365
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,161
He had a dog. She's seeing
Stark, our last patient.

366
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:04,099
Well, if it's Stark, he
wouldn't be haunting a patient,

367
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,696
he'd be haunting the
doctor who killed him.

368
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,797
She probably just overheard
someone talking about it, or...

369
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,137
Probably?

370
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,770
You think there's a possibility
that the alternative is true?

371
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,312
No. Then go away.

372
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,679
We're wasting time. We ran 32
gels, we could run 100 more.

373
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,944
Without knowing how her mother died...

374
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,849
You're gonna have to run 100 more.

375
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:22,978
By you, of course,

376
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,182
I'm only referring to the people
who care enough about human life

377
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,951
to put in a full day.

378
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,617
You want to carpool?

379
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,489
How do you expect me to
respond to this stuff?

380
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,531
Exactly like you just did.

381
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,192
I have a theory. Maybe
you can help me out.

382
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:40,670
Black Mormon means
masochist, means kinky.

383
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,199
I'm thinking that someone got hurt
making the bastard. Am I right?

384
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,402
You leave my son out of this.

385
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,480
I wasn't referring to your kid's
hypocrisy. I was referring to yours.

386
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,483
Why don't we just ask her how she died?

387
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,486
Because she won't tell us. She
thinks her mother's still alive.

388
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,955
I don't mean ask the patient.
I mean, ask her mother.

389
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,985
Cool.

390
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,728
Come on.

391
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,626
What the hell does that mean?

392
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,568
You guys talking your own language now?

393
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,438
I'm sorry. I'll try to include
some visual aids next time.

394
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,715
Now, what?

395
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:29,778
I'm Dr. House. Is your mom around?

396
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,049
Why should I tell you?

397
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,558
You're just gonna tell
me I'm lying or crazy.

398
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,255
I'm not gonna do that. I really
need to know what she has to say.

399
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,489
What do you want?

400
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,622
When you were young, was she...

401
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,963
No, not you. Him.

402
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,037
The man in the wheelchair?

403
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,867
No. He's old.

404
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,578
Actually, looks like you.

405
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,058
Yeah, that's Grandpa House.

406
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,957
Tell him to call back on a landline.

407
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,155
Terrible reception in here.

408
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,788
How much pain was your mom in?

409
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:14,923
It's Walter.

410
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,161
He says his name is Walter.

411
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,256
Can I help you?

412
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,957
My patient's talking to my Grandpa Walt.

413
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,330
You have a Grandpa Walt?

414
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,594
Nope.

415
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,863
Which is what made me suspect

416
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,302
that maybe she's not actually
seeing into the afterlife.

417
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,603
What is this sudden
obsession with the afterlife?

418
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,872
My only obsession is with the
idiots in the right-here-and-now life

419
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,275
who think there's an afterlife.

420
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,780
And you want me to... Nothing.

421
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:08,218
Just needed a place to hang low for
a while. I'm pretending to be spooked.

422
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,378
Because?

423
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,288
Because if my soon-to-be-brain-dead
patient thinks that I believe her,

424
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,721
maybe she'll let me chat
with her mother's ghost.

425
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,819
The one you don't believe exists.

426
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,989
Exactly.

427
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,829
The ghost is a hallucination,
which is the result of a delusion,

428
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,631
which most likely is the
result of a hereditary disease

429
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,865
that her mother died from
when the patient was four.

430
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,067
And you think you can tap
into her subconscious memory

431
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,235
by tapping into her hallucination.

432
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,801
Mmm-hmm.

433
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,007
She might not know what
caused her mother's death,

434
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,380
but she will know how
she acted before she died.

435
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,816
You're quite impressed with
yourself right now, aren't you?

436
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,615
Who wouldn't be?

437
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,124
Well, that should be long enough.

438
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,556
Back in a flash.

439
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,759
Take your time.

440
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,663
Is my grandfather still here?

441
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,764
No.

442
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,536
He should be right back.

443
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,839
He just went to get some warm milk.

444
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,509
But your mom's still here, right?

445
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,450
Yes, of course.

446
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,620
I know she's fine, now, but when
you were four or five, she got sick.

447
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,783
No.

448
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,226
You sure? She wasn't in any pain?

449
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,957
I wasn't in pain.

450
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,589
No, she was just tired.

451
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,860
And sometimes she would
stay in bed all day.

452
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,061
Did she ever fall down?

453
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,194
Of course.

454
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,636
Everyone falls down once in a while.

455
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,639
Sometimes, not that often.

456
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,107
How often?

457
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,747
Maybe it was actually
more than once in a while.

458
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,440
Remember that time in the bathroom?

459
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,678
Mmm.

460
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,549
A few times.

461
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:54,558
Once she hit her head on the bathroom
sink. There was blood all over the floor.

462
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,060
I got it on my sweater. I...

463
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,559
They took her away.

464
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,830
Yeah, to the place where
the doctor made her better.

465
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,428
But before that, what
about her arms and legs?

466
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,772
Did she ever walk funny,
like, sort of bent over?

467
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,238
I thought that was from
growing up on the farm!

468
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,508
What about her hands?

469
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,143
Did she ever have any difficulty
sewing, buttoning a shirt?

470
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,242
No.

471
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:27,957
But sometimes my hands would shiver.

472
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,828
Like I was cold, but I wasn't.
I never quite understood.

473
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,264
She used to get the
shivers. Like she was cold.

474
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,981
Start her on L-dopa and bromocriptine.

475
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,917
It's just Parkinson's.

476
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,133
Cole, how's it going with your patient?

477
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,863
Still seeing stuff.

478
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,463
I hear House is treating you like crap.

479
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,734
He treats everyone badly.

480
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,639
Yeah, but I heard you're special.

481
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,974
Well, I can handle it.

482
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:25,142
Maybe you shouldn't. He's gonna
walk all over you if you let him.

483
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,377
That says nothing about me, just him.

484
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,249
House respects people
who aren't afraid of him.

485
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,756
Get in his face. Yell, if you have to.

486
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,691
I don't need his respect.

487
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,025
You do if you want the job.

488
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,100
Thanks for the advice.

489
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,000
You have to hold still.

490
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,599
I'm trying!

491
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,036
Damn! Hold her down!

492
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,101
No!

493
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,580
Stop it! Let me do it.

494
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,846
No, no.

495
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,512
Hold her down!

496
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,288
No! No!

497
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,421
No!

498
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,566
Irene?

499
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,465
Irene?

500
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,902
You stabbed me.

501
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,911
You were having a
nightmare. It wasn't real.

502
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,909
My arm is bleeding.

503
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,711
No. It's okay now, your arm's not...

504
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,286
Lesions aren't explained by Parkinson's.

505
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,917
Any theories?

506
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,330
What, ghost got your tongue?

507
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,265
I'm fine.

508
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,564
What about vasculitis?

509
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,605
MRI didn't indicate
any cerebral ischemia.

510
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,471
But she has shown some focal
weakness, urinary retention.

511
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,099
Yes. Those are her big mystery symptoms,

512
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,475
not the hallucinations that
vasculitis doesn't explain.

513
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,139
Unless it's retinal vasculitis.

514
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,317
House, this guy may be smart, and I'm
sure he's great to share a beer with,

515
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,481
but if he doesn't know that visual
symptoms are an electrical issue,

516
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,490
not vascular, two separate systems...

517
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:20,030
So are the banks and the power grid, but
if I don't pay my bills my lights go out.

518
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:30,366
Vasculitis restricts blood flow to
nerves, messes with electrical function.

519
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,534
Acute intermittent
porphyria is a better fit.

520
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,636
If you're wrong about porphyria,
the treatment could box her kidneys.

521
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:40,515
Vasculitis is treated with
corticosteroids, relatively harmless.

522
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,210
Start her on the steroids.
House, he's not...

523
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,483
Then test for both so
he can stop whining.

524
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:50,790
Big Love, have I humiliated
you in the last half-hour?

525
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:51,920
No.

526
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,827
Check your e-mail.

527
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,934
How's it going?

528
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,439
Great.

529
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,807
The only way he can turn any more
cheeks is by pulling down his pants.

530
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,369
He's not a wuss. It takes
a lot more strength...

531
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,642
We didn't bet on how strong he was.

532
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:15,117
So, you're gonna collect $100 and
fire him because he has principles?

533
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,485
What's your agenda here? You
obviously don't care about the 100.

534
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,217
He's a decent, smart...

535
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,383
You don't care about the team.

536
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,984
Does it annoy Wilson when you ask
questions and ignore the answers?

537
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,359
Very much.

538
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:29,194
You only care about who
I hire and who I fire

539
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,962
because you miss going through my mail.

540
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,197
You can't stop controlling me.

541
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,829
No one controls you.

542
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,636
Want your job back? No.

543
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,644
Too bad, you can't have it.
She'll take care of this.

544
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:44,170
You can take it out of the
100 you're gonna owe me.

545
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,978
I met House at a conference
about five years ago.

546
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,021
He's quite a character. Yes, he is.

547
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,887
Probably one of the best
medical minds of our generation.

548
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,324
I agree. I learned
an awful lot from him.

549
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,693
I'll bet you did. I see here
you just did a stint at Mercy.

550
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,026
Great.

551
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,500
It says here "'07 to Present.
" How long were you there?

552
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,733
About a month. Dr. Schaffer was great,
but it just wasn't the right fit.

553
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,037
Wait, was that you with Dr.
Schaffer and the lymphoma patient?

554
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,739
It was... It was a tough situation.
I probably could've handled it better.

555
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:20,443
No, Dr. Schaffer's got a stick
up her rear, good for you.

556
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,076
What made you so sure it was lymphoma?

557
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,951
There was an unusual lactic
acid level in one of her labs.

558
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,887
I had a similar case a few months ago.

559
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,984
Beautiful. God, I
wish I had your stones.

560
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,789
Well, my stones are on the market.

561
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,958
No, I mean, seriously,
I wish I had your stones.

562
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:39,127
I could cram you down
the board of directors.

563
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,536
But I don't. I'm sorry, man.

564
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,075
Good luck.

565
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,243
When your retinas see something,

566
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,578
they send electrical
signals to your brain.

567
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,879
These lenses will pick up those signals.

568
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,647
If the signals are
misfiring, it'll confirm

569
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,620
that an old man without a medical
license is smarter than all of us,

570
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,384
that your hallucinations
were caused by...

571
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,427
They're not hallucinations.
Tell them, Mom.

572
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,655
Honey, they're doctors.

573
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,630
They must know what they're doing.

574
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:12,260
If they know what they're doing, how
did they kill that poor man's dog?

575
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,803
Come on, this has got to be
freaking you out a little bit.

576
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,605
I appreciate your concern.

577
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,407
There's nothing to be ashamed of here.

578
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,345
If the ghost of a man you killed
doesn't screw with your head,

579
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,282
there's something wrong with your head.

580
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,352
See, that freaks me out.

581
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,124
Someone must have left it in here.

582
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,529
Absolutely, that makes sense,

583
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,930
some dog was in here
getting his eyes checked

584
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,434
and forgot to put his jewelry back on.

585
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,696
This isn't working.

586
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,203
You're just making me
sicker, like he said you...

587
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,432
What's wrong?

588
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,442
My stomach, it hurts.

589
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,344
Code in the eye lab.
Lean forward, Irene.

590
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,473
You're gonna aspirate.

591
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,745
I can't. It hurts.

592
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,117
Why won't you help me?

593
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,487
Spleen's ripe to bursting. You
guys thought it was vasculitis?

594
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:16,966
You used to be on House's team, right?

595
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,970
Yeah. Got a lot of
blood in here. Sponge.

596
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,503
You got any advice for me?

597
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,563
Nope.

598
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,337
You always put up with his crap?

599
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,469
Yeah.

600
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,536
Was it a mistake?

601
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,707
It was irrelevant.

602
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,147
Well, he fired you.

603
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,913
He'll fire you either way. Eventually.

604
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,222
Dr. Cameron told me
about... Don't want to know.

605
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,521
Why not? Because House is watching.

606
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,022
Not a metaphor. Look up.

607
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,262
<i>You guys gonna shoot the breeze,</i>

608
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,566
<i>or you gonna do something
about all that bleeding?</i>

609
00:32:56,274 --> 00:33:00,176
That's not coming from
the spleen. It's the liver.

610
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,302
It's necrotic.

611
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,574
She's dying from the inside out.

612
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,480
Enlarged spleen and liver
failure are classic AIP.

613
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,649
It's porphyria and it's moving fast.

614
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,159
PBGs were negative. If
you read the reports...

615
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:20,287
PBG tests are only conclusive
if done during an attack,

616
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,629
which you would know if
you were a real doctor.

617
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,258
That is just great.

618
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,859
What is? Which one of us is?

619
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,234
Both of you. Together.

620
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,173
Fighting. Passionate to
prove the other one wrong.

621
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,301
Couldn't care less about the patient,
but it all works out the same.

622
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,676
I hate Thirteen.

623
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,113
Not as productively. Continue.

624
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,209
It could still be vascular.

625
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,184
Vasculitis is off the board.

626
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,753
Steroid treatment didn't help.

627
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,652
Vascular isn't just vasculitis.

628
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,022
Something's got to be cutting off the
blood supply to her liver and spleen.

629
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,493
Do a visceral angiogram.

630
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,291
This is a joke, right?

631
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,888
He can't be right every single time.

632
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,695
You're feeding him your
ideas just to embarrass us.

633
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:02,296
If I wanted to embarrass you, I'd
have you mop up the doctors' lounge.

634
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:40,406
Heavenly Father, I pray thee that
thou shalt give the Holy Ghost

635
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,844
unto all them that shall
believe in their words.

636
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,717
Irene, what are you doing?

637
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,343
I need to touch it.

638
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,409
Put your hand down.

639
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,456
No! Give it to me! I want it!

640
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,253
Give it to me! No!

641
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:06,728
What the angio say?

642
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,465
We couldn't finish.
She started groping me.

643
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,269
And you couldn't let her get to
second base just to get the test done?

644
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,603
I think that's third base.

645
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,645
She was convulsing, delirious
and hyper-salivating.

646
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,544
We had to knock her out with lorazepam.

647
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,413
Well, that's definitely not vascular.

648
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,885
What do you want us to do?

649
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,151
The question is, what
would Joseph Smith do?

650
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,246
This isn't the time for anti...

651
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,314
Casting out the demons?

652
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:31,293
The patient's not possessed. She's
dying. You can mock me tomorrow.

653
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,991
You believe that the
book has all the answers.

654
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,533
To morality, not science.

655
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,296
But the book is
inconsistent with science.

656
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,339
You know how many epileptics were
tortured because they were possessed?

657
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,340
How many teenage witches
were stoned to death,

658
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,466
because they took mushrooms?

659
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,943
Just shut up already.
We got a patient dying.

660
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:53,348
You either got to prescribe an exorcism,
or admit to me that Smith was a horny fraud.

661
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,994
I know what she has.

662
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,965
You couldn't have
spoken up 10 seconds ago?

663
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,501
You would have saved me 100 bucks.

664
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,901
Mushrooms weren't the only thing
that got people stoned to death,

665
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,668
jimsonweed, belladonna,
mandrake root and moldy bread.

666
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:18,866
It's ergot poisoning.

667
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,000
You'd need damp grain that's...

668
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,068
Completely unprocessed and untreated,

669
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,707
like what's in that organic
rye bread she's been eating.

670
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,385
Should I be going home? Is it 6:00?

671
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,351
It's why she got worse
on the bromocriptine.

672
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,513
It's an ergot derivative.

673
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,216
There hasn't been a case in 50 years.

674
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,690
She kept asking for milk. Dairy
products counteract the effects.

675
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,557
You think she knew what
she had and was treating it?

676
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,686
Cravings based on actual needs,

677
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,926
it's a fairly common
evolutionary development.

678
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,098
You okay with an answer
based on evolution?

679
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,466
Yeah.

680
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,638
Hypocrite.

681
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,742
It's the stuff they make LSD from.
The treatment you're on should...

682
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,747
So, I've just been tripping?

683
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:02,580
It explains the hallucinations,
seizures, delusions...

684
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,521
Constricts the blood vessels,
which explains the necrosis.

685
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,290
She's not here?

686
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,496
I'm sorry, no.

687
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:29,071
The fact that you're even
willing to accept that answer

688
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,944
means the medicine is starting to work.

689
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,285
But you'll live.

690
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,420
You're beautiful, Reena.

691
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,587
You too, Mama.

692
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,728
I'm going to miss you.

693
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:27,666
Mama.

694
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,567
As you know, there
are seven of you and...

695
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,871
One, two, three, four...

696
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,435
Only six roses.

697
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,878
Those are peonies.

698
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,949
But I'm sure they're
part of the rose family.

699
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:20,213
Actually, I'm surprised
there are seven of you.

700
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,987
You punch your boss and stick around?

701
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,790
Give me the flower and shut up.

702
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,231
Don't overdo it.

703
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:35,636
Now, I would love to keep all of you,
but not enough to do anything about it.

704
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,473
So, according to my arbitrary
schedule, one of you has to go.

705
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,022
You're kidding!

706
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,369
I came up with the answer.
I robbed a grave. I...

707
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,804
Planted a dog collar in the procedure
room just to screw with my head.

708
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,706
No, I never.

709
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,704
What, you don't believe she did it?

710
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,679
I'm sure she did it.

711
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,879
That's why she's getting the flower.
It was beautiful, she just overreached.

712
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,477
She got into your head. No, I...

713
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,523
She owned you.

714
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,387
Planting the idea was good.

715
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,984
Letting it fester was good.
Leaving the collar was stupid.

716
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,520
Well-known fact, ghosts don't
leave things lying around.

717
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,229
So, am I gone then?

718
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:56,215
Oh, my goodness. I totally
forgot about you two. Well played.

719
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,597
Sorry, Henry.

720
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,899
We had some giggles.

721
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,901
You agreed with everything he said.
You finished each other's sentences.

722
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,970
That's why I got to go.

723
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,117
Don't need someone to tell you
what you're already thinking.

724
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,017
Funny, I was gonna say that.

725
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,554
If you want to hang out... Yeah, I know.

726
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,118
Call Wilson.

727
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,165
The rest of you, 8:00 tomorrow.

728
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,974
Cash will be fine.

729
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,606
I bet you say that to all the guys.

730
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,940
Take your blood money.

731
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:05,111
Who are you gonna protect next?

732
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,680
If I told you, it wouldn't work.

733
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,529
I've re-thought some things.

734
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,767
Glad to hear it.

735
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:28,175
I'm prepared to come back
on a number of conditions.

736
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,645
I want the raise you
promised, plus five percent.

737
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,808
I want my own office
and a personal assistant.

738
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,611
That's not unreasonable.

739
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,482
I will give you none of those.

740
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,618
You can come back at
your original salary.

741
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,457
What's going on?

742
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,061
You haven't re-thought anything.

743
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,033
You've just been black-balled.

744
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,329
You're "House, Lite" now.

745
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:57,932
The only administrator that will touch
you is the one who hired "House, Classic. "

746
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:02,035
The good news is she'll pretend
she's not doing you a favor.

747
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,882
I can start Monday.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
