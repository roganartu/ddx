1
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,072
Roman emperors were the real punks.

2
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,705
Don't say "punk. " It's cliché.

3
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,977
Whatever. Let me tell you
about these dinner parties.

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,746
Nero loved a good poisoning.

5
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,582
At a dinner party? He'd arrange
one right at the table...

6
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:22,985
I don't feel like going on tonight.

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,219
Too bad, 'cause that's what makes
the club feel like paying us.

8
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,919
Titus, this was all in the book.

9
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,586
Titus would ply his guests with wine,

10
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:32,187
then bind their privates with a chord.

11
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,825
Hey! Did you get a new guitar?

12
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,394
A '64 teardrop reissue.
Not a mark on it.

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,806
All right.

14
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,443
Can I see it?

15
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,505
Oh, it's nice.

16
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:54,679
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey,
cut it out, man! Hey!

17
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,188
You stupid son of a... You're gonna pay!

18
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,918
It's a hunk of wood, bro.

19
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,584
It should look like a hunk of wood.

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,525
We're not the philharmonic.

21
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,029
See, look, man. It's better already.

22
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,292
Hey! It's 10:45.

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,531
How about taking that onstage?

24
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,365
Now I feel like going on.

25
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,187
<i>You're my child, and so
are those quadruplets,</i>

26
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,060
<i>and I'm not gonna give any of you up.</i>

27
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,565
<i>Don't you dare talk to me as a mother.</i>

28
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,694
Sign on the door says
"closed for private event. "

29
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,662
You're alone.

30
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,435
How much more private can you get?

31
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,702
Will you pass me a tissue?

32
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,745
Who are you keeping? You owed
me a decision 10 days ago.

33
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,279
Total amnesia.

34
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,041
<i>You're my whole life, you.</i>

35
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,577
And Luisa Maria can't decide if
she's gonna keep the quadruplets.

36
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,453
<i>Then how can you...</i>

37
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,650
She keeps them. I read it online.

38
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,888
You happy now? I ruined it for you.

39
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,794
I want two names by Friday. Fine.

40
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,732
I'll arrange for a patient with a
mysterious illness to come in on Thursday.

41
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,632
Yes. You need more tests.

42
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,261
It's only been two months.

43
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,670
Who knows how they'll react
to freak weather patterns?

44
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,139
They all did fine in the wind tunnel.

45
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,475
Two names by Friday or the pay
overruns come out of your salary.

46
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,485
<i>I can hurt you. I know that now.</i>

47
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,386
And I move your parking
space to the E lot.

48
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,392
<i>Don't ever leave me, Mom!</i>

49
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,725
Hey.

50
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,627
Who's the sickest patient you got?

51
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,997
I've got a guy who'll be
dead in the next 10 minutes.

52
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:59,202
Oh. You mean someone who might
actually survive a diagnosis.

53
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:01,897
There's nothing here.

54
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,376
Just the usual cracked
heads, gunshots, false alarms.

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,608
Who would you pick to fill
your narrow little flats?

56
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,582
So, you can fire them
off my recommendation?

57
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,243
Nice try.

58
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,880
Hey, who do I have to grope to
get some turndown service in here?

59
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,618
Jimmy Quidd. He's a punk rock singer.

60
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,319
Punk rock star to you.

61
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,056
Repeated trauma, self-cutting, fever,

62
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,499
arthralgia, hyper-inflated
chest, fatigue, anemia,

63
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,331
blood in the stool and urine.

64
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,394
I've died and gone to diagnostic heaven.

65
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,238
His blood results show booze,
cocaine, amphetamines, opiates.

66
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,403
The only mystery here is
how he made it to be 38.

67
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,537
I'm 28.

68
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,046
And he lies.

69
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,548
And he's a pain in the ass.

70
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,983
Hey, come on. No.

71
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,385
Wrap him up. I'll take him to go.

72
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,122
Dizzying array of symptoms,

73
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,829
any of which could be caused
by drugs, trauma, being a loser.

74
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,366
The guy's a walking
pharmacy, could be anything.

75
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,767
Oh, forgot to mention. Final case.

76
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,032
Get it right, you're hired.

77
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,564
Runner-up will be decided strictly
on some definition of merit.

78
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,907
Endocarditis. Hemorrhagic
lesions on the lungs and gut.

79
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,413
Bronchiolitis obliterans, he
smoked his airways into oblivion.

80
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,846
Endocarditits. I already said that.

81
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,144
I heard of it before you mentioned it.

82
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,242
Speed counts. Find something else.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,412
Could be bacterial meningitis.

84
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,216
You already picked.
I'll take meningitis.

85
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,757
Too late. Go run your tests.

86
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,453
No. He's sick 'cause he's a drug addict.

87
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,521
No. He has every symptom you'd
expect from a drug addict.

88
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,532
So, you think it's all too perfect?

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,727
Some other disease is trying
to throw us off its trail?

90
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,237
If he had four out of
20 possible symptoms,

91
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,432
he'd be a garden-variety druggie.

92
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,771
Twenty out of 20, there's
an underlying disease.

93
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,936
Run your tests. No!

94
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,342
He's weak, in withdrawal,
just spewed blood.

95
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,848
They're gonna rip off
a piece of his lung,

96
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,145
ram instruments down his throat,

97
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,015
and Roto-Rooter his intestines.

98
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,179
It'd be nice if we didn't kill him

99
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,950
trying to figure out what's killing him.

100
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,827
One diagnosis, one test at a time.

101
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,522
O2 sats are low, hyper-inflated chest.

102
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,690
I need a bronchoscopy to...

103
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,757
You just lost two points. What for?

104
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,996
For thinking it makes a
difference who goes first.

105
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,368
Only one person can
be right. What points?

106
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,770
Can't have an objective system

107
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,365
of measurement without numbers.

108
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,410
You lose three for not knowing that.

109
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:24,677
From now on, only the person
holding this can treat or run tests.

110
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,051
Wanted to give you the serpent
staff with the poison axe-head,

111
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,782
but I left it in my car.

112
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,221
Thank you.

113
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,460
Don't need you. It's one
thing to hire based on a game.

114
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,934
Don't need your lecture.

115
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,164
It's insane to treat based on a game.

116
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,002
You're not taking the long view.

117
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,235
The one where we stuff
another patient in a body bag?

118
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,402
No, if we're wrong,
that'll come pretty fast.

119
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,912
The long view is the one
where we pick the best team,

120
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,815
that way we can use all the bags
we save for grocery shopping.

121
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,451
You're not buying
that argument, are you?

122
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,545
No.

123
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,351
In which case, I'm back
to my original position.

124
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,948
Don't need you.

125
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,626
What do you think of Amber?

126
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,601
I screwed up a diagnosis.

127
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,241
You don't seem that upset by it.

128
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:31,210
I diagnosed a guy with
adenocarcinoma three months ago.

129
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,979
Told him he had six months.

130
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,919
So, now you gotta tell him that he's
way behind on his Christmas shopping?

131
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,082
He didn't get worse.
I rechecked everything.

132
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,760
Biopsy was a false positive.

133
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,626
Harmless lesions caused
by talc inhalation.

134
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,790
Medical clemency.

135
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,265
Interesting.

136
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,329
Why would you use that word?

137
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,303
Because I'm interested.

138
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,129
When I'm interested,
I describe the things

139
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,970
that make me interested as interesting.

140
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,943
Most people would say
good, possibly great.

141
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,103
Why aren't you able to just enjoy...

142
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,580
Why aren't other people
able to just be interested?

143
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,349
Is he in there?

144
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,550
Yeah.

145
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,054
Why'd you go right
for the drug theories?

146
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,789
If he had a history of
shoving cancer into his veins,

147
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,798
I'd have guessed cancer.

148
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,331
Okay. You're an idiot.

149
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,597
Either that or you've decided
you can trust a smoking addict

150
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,730
alone in a bathroom with an oxygen tank.

151
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,981
I got your new test results back.

152
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,142
Sorry I'm late.

153
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,312
Who's your colleague?

154
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,448
Dr. House.

155
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,117
Yes, Dr. Wilson.

156
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,925
I really don't need the consult.

157
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,588
I know the prognosis.

158
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,188
Apparently not.

159
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,634
Mr. McKenna, I can't
believe I'm able to say this,

160
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,970
but you're cancer-free.

161
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,908
The biopsy looked like
adenocarcinoma, but it wasn't.

162
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,844
Harmless lesions on
your lungs. You're fine.

163
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,143
I don't get it.

164
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,017
Cool. No, it's...

165
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,752
I know this must come as a shock,

166
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,852
but I've double-checked the labs.

167
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,797
I just accepted an offer on my house.

168
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,430
I've had three goodbye parties.

169
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,130
I'm buying plane tickets to Venice.

170
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,672
You can still use those if you're alive.

171
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,040
I have to pay a $6,000 broker
commission on a house I'm not selling.

172
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,209
Money I don't have.

173
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,184
Thank you for letting me know.

174
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,924
I would have thought the living
would mean more than the expenses.

175
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,225
It's not about the money.

176
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,975
I have 17 points?

177
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,877
I started you all out on 100.

178
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,506
Then you blew up part of the building.

179
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,880
Where's Foreman?

180
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,077
He got paged.

181
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,052
By who? Is it about our... Me.

182
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,521
I needed him right away, somewhere else.

183
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,217
We're hiding from Foreman?

184
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,784
Foreman accused me of playing
games with patient care.

185
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,022
Who gets the eyeball next?

186
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,655
I haven't run my test yet. It
still might be a lung issue.

187
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,462
You can't run your test. The
patient had massive smoke inhalation.

188
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,593
Do a bronchoscopy, it'll
set off a laryngospasm.

189
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,898
I'll do an open-lung biopsy instead.

190
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,098
You want an invasive surgery
because you screwed up?

191
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,731
The patient snuck a cigarette.

192
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,173
The patient is an addict.

193
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,471
It's not his fault he's jonesing

194
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,841
for whatever he can get his hands on.

195
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,880
Not his fault he's jonesing?

196
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,348
In what universe does
that make any sense?

197
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,442
Get him on a nicotine patch.

198
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,749
That'll keep up with his joneses.

199
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,311
Do your biopsy.

200
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,894
How's the new us's final case going?

201
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,835
It's a moving target. House keeps
moving it, so I can't find it.

202
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:17,371
So, you decided to focus on
solving the problem in Darfur?

203
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,441
Taub is in there prepping
the patient for a biopsy.

204
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,346
Stay close to Taub,
I stay close to House.

205
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,981
And stay close to the game.

206
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,043
I'm trying to stop the game.

207
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,145
That's your role in the game.

208
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,417
Did you wander over here to annoy me?

209
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,425
You're not wearing a lab coat.

210
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,256
House doesn't wear one, does he?

211
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,454
Damn!

212
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,088
Now when I walk away,
it's gonna look like

213
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,326
I have a reason other
than just annoyance.

214
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,465
He won't let us finish
prepping him for the biopsy.

215
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,030
Try the other arm.

216
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,339
The problem's not the arm,
it's the entire patient.

217
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,613
Hi.

218
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,956
He let you check his chest.

219
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,994
He let you do anything
except check that arm.

220
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,097
He wallpapered himself
with nicotine patches.

221
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,765
Real rebellion has a point, it's
not just juvenile and purposeless.

222
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,842
Maybe purposelessness is my purpose.

223
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,575
Mission accomplished.

224
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,410
Amber, it's not the patches.

225
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,508
He's got blood clots
moving through his body.

226
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,349
Means I was wrong.

227
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,081
Oh!

228
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,857
If the clot reaches his lungs
or his heart, it'll kill him.

229
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,425
It's true!

230
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,800
We all know it's true.

231
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,065
You just wasted our time.

232
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,367
And what you're doing?

233
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,498
I'm not competing.

234
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,701
Where's Taub? Foreman was following him.

235
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,869
So, you paged Taub.

236
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,969
Didn't see that I had much choice.

237
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,776
He has schistocytes on his blood smear

238
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,749
which means DIC's causing the clotting.

239
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,149
What's causing the DIC?

240
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,153
Drug impurities. You lost your round.

241
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,189
New symptom, new round.
This has to be drug related.

242
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,487
This is how doctors kill patients,
by seeing the stereotypes...

243
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,993
Drug addicts use drugs is a stereotype?

244
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,995
Drugs are bad is a stereotype?

245
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,031
Losers lose is... Malaria.

246
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,464
He hasn't left the country in years.

247
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,195
Malaria's relapsing-recurring.

248
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,896
For all we know, he could
have been sick for years.

249
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,428
It explains not just the DIC and the
bleeding, but the tiredness, fever,

250
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,872
everything we attributed to drugs.

251
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,376
Oh, yeah. It's much more
likely that this ass punk rocker

252
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,504
was exposed to malaria than drugs?

253
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,049
If you were always right, then
you wouldn't have just been wrong.

254
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,278
Or let the patient mainline nicotine.

255
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,183
Or ravaged my anatomical model,

256
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,620
which Grandma House bought
me when I aced my MCATs.

257
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,386
A pharmaceutical rep
left that here on Tuesday.

258
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,790
Grandma does some part-time work.

259
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,988
The rep was a 30-something babe.

260
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,293
Thank you. I got her hips.

261
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,730
Carry it with pride.

262
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,497
Manipulative bitch, you're
wanted in the loser's circle.

263
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,904
Why do you hate drug addicts?

264
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,043
Your situation is different.

265
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,240
You're taking a
necessary prescription...

266
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,342
I know. I'm fabulous.
And I'm not the patient.

267
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,216
I'm not allowed to have
a problem with junkies?

268
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,051
You're allowed. There's
gotta be a reason.

269
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,853
He's the patient. You don't
know him. Why do you hate him?

270
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,588
He's throwing his life away.

271
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,994
'Cause he's setting his own terms,

272
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,761
not living in fear of every pop quiz?

273
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,302
I thought we were talking about him.

274
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,736
We were never talking about him.

275
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,368
Why are you afraid to lose?

276
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,103
Are you gonna fire me
because I like to win?

277
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,274
Just wanna know the reason.

278
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:51,179
I watched this football game
once, and I noticed something odd.

279
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,782
The winning team was the happy one.

280
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,819
I did the math.

281
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,557
Our patient's happy.

282
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,655
He's an idiot.

283
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,461
He's a happy idiot.

284
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,499
That screws with your worldview.

285
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,534
There's something freeing about
being a loser, isn't there?

286
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,597
Why are you afraid to...

287
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,442
Mommy didn't love me enough.
Daddy expected too much from me.

288
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,204
Something.

289
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:23,253
Let's assume that's true. I get how
that can make me a screwed up person.

290
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,315
But how is my willingness to do
anything to get the right answer

291
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,156
bad for my patients?

292
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,993
Or put in terms you can
understand, how is it bad for you?

293
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,275
I didn't ask you to pick up the meds.

294
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,437
I'm trying to be a good colleague.

295
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,775
You're trying to boost your score

296
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,212
by prescribing drugs for House.

297
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,544
Why else would you have a second bag?

298
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,914
Didn't say good colleague to you.

299
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,111
You realize we still have a patient.

300
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,380
Don't care about the patient.

301
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,388
You care about this job more
than you care about his life?

302
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,287
I care about my wallpaper more
than I care about his life.

303
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,552
Okay. You're jerking me around.

304
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,059
There's no reason to be a
doctor if you don't care.

305
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,095
I care about life. I
just don't care about his.

306
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,494
He doesn't care, why should I?

307
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,690
My time is better spent...

308
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,733
Kissing up to your boss?

309
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,063
Average doctor cuts off a
patient 18 seconds into a history,

310
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,162
because that's all the time he's got.

311
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,571
Meanwhile, six of us are administering
to a guy with a death wish.

312
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,007
So, why do you want the job?

313
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,240
Not because I'm maximizing
my service to mankind.

314
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,204
Good for you.

315
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,618
Where is he?

316
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,986
We're gonna spend the next hour

317
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,958
looking for a guy who
doesn't wanna be found.

318
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:45,096
Jimmy Quidd's greatest stiff. 1989.

319
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,105
A profit-seeking entity released this?

320
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,970
He put it out himself.

321
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,066
He wanted people to
listen, but apparently

322
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,738
didn't want people to enjoy listening.

323
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,542
Now, why would someone...
Truly a mystery.

324
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,051
Why would anyone do something
just to aggravate people?

325
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,985
Why would you have a blank
liability release form

326
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,788
plus your checkbook on top of your desk?

327
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,522
Probably because they
were in the second drawer,

328
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,328
in a manila envelope, under a book,

329
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,164
and you put them on top of my desk.

330
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,897
You usually keep your checkbook at home.

331
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,407
It's your go-to excuse for
why you can't lend me money.

332
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,644
You're gonna pay the guy
the six grand, aren't you?

333
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,273
There are other people I write
checks to. I do have cable.

334
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,147
There's no negligence without injury.

335
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,277
I handed the guy a death sentence.

336
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,151
He's not distressed
with the death sentence.

337
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,213
He's distressed with the life sentence.

338
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,486
I gave him three months of misery.

339
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,324
You gave him three months
of being someone special.

340
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,024
You're paying the guy
because he used to be boring,

341
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,760
and without you, he's
gonna be boring again.

342
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,025
Hi.

343
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,504
Results of the malaria tests already?

344
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,835
Well, no.

345
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:00,345
But we were wondering if you'd sent
the patient for any additional tests?

346
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,513
You lost the patient.

347
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:12,551
Taub, you check lost and
found. Thirteen, come with me.

348
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,355
Why do you love drug addicts?

349
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,493
I won't pigeonhole the
patient, so that means I'm...

350
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,330
Perfectly capable of
drawing my own conclusions.

351
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,063
Are you capable of answering a question?

352
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,695
I think there's more
to him than the drugs.

353
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,796
Admirable, why?

354
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,568
I need a reason for
doing something admirable?

355
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,733
There's always a reason.

356
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,470
He's a patient. You don't
know him. Why do you like him?

357
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,944
Alcoholic parent? Druggie youth?

358
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,947
There's no such thing as
a saint without a past.

359
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,141
Or a sinner without a future.

360
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,380
What makes you so sure that drugs
are a mask for something else?

361
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,251
Drugs are always a
mask for something else.

362
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,552
That's the dumbest thing
I've heard in my life.

363
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,140
You really want this job?

364
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,869
Why, you think you can
talk me into leaving?

365
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,205
You're a person who likes her privacy,

366
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,109
working for a man who
needs to know everything.

367
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,171
You're a person who
cares about her patients,

368
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,911
working for a man who cares about games.

369
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,918
I hear him.

370
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:21,788
Neither sleet, nor
mail, nor dread of night.

371
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,292
Hold on.

372
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,058
Malaria's not contagious.

373
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,692
Children, I bid you good night.

374
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,870
Which one of you guys sapped my powers?

375
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,182
Was it you? Did you take my powers?

376
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,784
Or maybe it was you.

377
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,050
Well, no matter. See, I'm
feeling stronger already.

378
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,022
It's okay. It's okay. He's okay.

379
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,860
Respiration's good. Pulse is solid.

380
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,197
We need a lot of nurses in here!

381
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:24,077
Dr. Cuddy, the face that
launched a thousand long faces.

382
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,583
Get control of your patient.

383
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,683
Strap him to the bed if you have to.

384
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,455
I wanna keep all four.

385
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,928
You can have two.

386
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,363
You don't get negotiation, do you?

387
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,069
I say four, you say three. We
finally settle on three-and-a-half,

388
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,694
which would be good news for Taub.

389
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,262
You don't want four.
You don't want three.

390
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,175
But if I say three, you get
to keep playing your game.

391
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,806
Who would you pick?

392
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,110
Are you asking my opinion?

393
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,277
If you have any absolute truths,
that would be even better.

394
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,014
You never want my advice.

395
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,489
You spend your life
trying to avoid my advice.

396
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,423
You're a bureaucratic nightmare,

397
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,017
you're a chronic pain in the ass,

398
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,120
and you're a second-rate
doctor at best.

399
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,824
Am I blushing?

400
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:10,356
But you do know this stuff.

401
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,599
Can we get this over with?

402
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,302
Taub and Kutner.

403
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,471
Taub will stand up to you. You won't
like him, but you'll respect him.

404
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,076
Kutner shares your
philosophy of medicine.

405
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,052
God knows I don't need two of you,

406
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,317
but he will actually help you.

407
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,952
It's not malaria, the
blood work is negative.

408
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,462
But we did find the reason for
the DIC. Bad blood fragments.

409
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,792
So if we can figure out
how they got there...

410
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,701
Blood exposure during sex?

411
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,171
Haemolysis from the malaria meds?

412
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,107
Stop guessing, you'll
spoil the surprise.

413
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,734
If you're looking to get
information out of the guy,

414
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,507
he's not exactly the
bare-your-soul type.

415
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,645
<i>Hey, I was wondering if you
guys know Girl from Ipanema?</i>

416
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,547
What are you doing?
Nothing. What are you doing?

417
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,889
That's mine, man.

418
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,693
You're gonna be denying
that in a second.

419
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,262
Next time make sure you bring
enough for the whole class.

420
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,639
He's been sharing needles with this guy.

421
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,110
Means he injected this guy's
blood, his own blood attacked it,

422
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,704
chewed it up, those were
the fragments we found.

423
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,009
So, DIC was nothing?

424
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,311
We're back to bloody vomit,

425
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:36,150
and his two dozen other
drug or non-drug symptoms.

426
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,685
Re-check everything.

427
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,693
Throw these guys out and
strap the patient down.

428
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,023
House!

429
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,793
Respiratory failure.

430
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,897
Good news for you, Thirteen.

431
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,731
'Cause that is definitely not drugs.

432
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,214
<i>The blood clots were drug related.</i>

433
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:08,275
Coughing up blood and the respiratory
arrests are still on the table.

434
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,342
Inhalants?

435
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,355
If I wanted or needed
your drug diagnosis,

436
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,913
I would have told Foreman where we are.

437
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,856
He knows where we are.

438
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,961
'Cause he followed you!

439
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,725
I followed Taub. I followed her.

440
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,199
He had a bleeding problem. That
could cause respiratory arrest.

441
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,294
Again, if I wanted to forgive
his Drano drinking ways,

442
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,804
I wouldn't ignore what you just said.

443
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,897
Could be an infection.

444
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,805
No, lumbar puncture's clear.

445
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,070
What lumbar puncture?

446
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,475
You didn't authorize that test.

447
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,740
True, and yet here I
am with the results.

448
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,577
Thirteen thought it was
bacterial meningitis.

449
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,344
And I had the eyeball.

450
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,612
It was a harmless test.

451
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,744
Patient's welfare still counts
for something, doesn't it?

452
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:43,981
Yep. Minus 50.

453
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,456
Chronic pulmonary embolisms would
explain the breathing problem

454
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,994
and the blood coming from his lungs.

455
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,125
I'll run an ultrasound...
You're not running any tests.

456
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,031
He knows it's not PEs,
the guy's d-dimer's normal.

457
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,126
That doesn't always rule out...

458
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,501
You go in to run one test,
run eight more like she did,

459
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,269
find out which one's right, then
comes back with a brilliant guess.

460
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,832
Is this true? No.

461
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,312
That's too bad, 'cause that would have
earned you 40 points for cleverness.

462
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,849
Points go to Amber.
Foreman, you run the test.

463
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,715
Sure, anything I can
do to help your game.

464
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,747
He's not gonna run the
tests. No. I don't think so.

465
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,387
So, what's wrong with me?

466
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,293
You mean, besides your music?

467
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,231
Oh, sure. Just because I
don't play your kind of music,

468
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,033
it's not music, right?

469
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,165
Yeah, I resent you 'cause
you're not Perry Como.

470
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:43,738
Look I don't play for an audience, okay?

471
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,978
Well, then, that stage you
stand on is an odd choice.

472
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,044
I just... I do it for me,
okay? I don't do it for you.

473
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,884
There are three choices in this life.

474
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,152
Be good, get good or give up.

475
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,127
You've gone for column D. Why?

476
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,862
Simple answer is if you
don't try, you can't fail.

477
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,466
Are you really that simple?

478
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,877
Look, yeah, some people,
they like my music.

479
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,004
Most people can't stand it.

480
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,984
But they just sort of
just shrug and ignore me.

481
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:25,045
But a few, they feel
like they have to tell me

482
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,587
what I'm screwing up, you
know, what I'm wasting.

483
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,459
Why do they care?

484
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,372
You have some peculiar
masses near your heart.

485
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,838
Peculiar, how?

486
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,900
Well, unlike your music, they
elicit some emotional response.

487
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,313
That's odd.

488
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:52,807
You care if I appreciate your music,

489
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,478
but you don't care if you live or die.

490
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,488
Maybe the answer is that simple.

491
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,327
I can't apologize enough,
to you, to your family.

492
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,329
There may not be any
technical liability here but...

493
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,304
You're ripping it up because you think

494
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,139
it would be wrong to take money from me?

495
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,374
I think it would be wrong to
take so little money from you.

496
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,750
You're out $6,000...

497
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,341
You ruined my life.

498
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,251
I ruined three months.

499
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:35,521
For the first time in my life, I was living
in the present, 'cause that's all there was.

500
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:42,127
You're suing me, not for the wrong
diagnosis, but for the right one?

501
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,935
Have you spoken to a lawyer?

502
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,304
You gave me happiness,

503
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,535
and then you took it away.

504
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,716
Definitely no emboli.

505
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,946
It's pretty fuzzy.

506
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,489
Hey, for point and shoot,
I thought I did okay.

507
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,956
It's fuzzy 'cause he was still shaking,

508
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,493
'cause he was coming
down from the heroin.

509
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,619
Where is everybody else?

510
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,629
Clinic's been quarantined.

511
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,325
Patient came in with
avian flu-like symptoms,

512
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,493
and 50 extra dollars in spending money.

513
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,332
Can you do this echo again?

514
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,271
Okay, minus five for ingratitude.

515
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,671
No "Thank you, Dr. House. "

516
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,369
No "Here's a bottle of Codeine

517
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,001
"for your troubles, Dr. House. " Oh, no.

518
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,545
I was asking if you could do it again

519
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,138
after giving him a
sedative to keep him still.

520
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,582
I could. We'd definitely get the answer,

521
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,984
but since the opiates would
decrease his respiratory drive,

522
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,954
and he already can barely breathe,

523
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,389
minus 10 for asking
me to kill the patient.

524
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,653
What if it's a congenital defect,

525
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,661
an anomalous vessel on his heart?

526
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,163
You know that the heart
does the blood stuff, right?

527
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,029
And the lungs do the breathing?

528
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,830
If the vessel wrapped
around his trachea.

529
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,664
What do you want me to do?

530
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:58,800
MRA.

531
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,002
So you can get a clear
picture of that vessel.

532
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,211
What? Wait, what? What? Why?

533
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,608
You said the picture sucked
because the patient was shaking.

534
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,881
MRA will be worse.

535
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,922
We have to get a picture.

536
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,627
You were doing better
before you had a good idea.

537
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,596
How can we see it if
we don't take a picture?

538
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,031
You can see me, right?

539
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,370
We wanna look at his
heart with our eyes.

540
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,569
So, I kill the patient
on my operating table,

541
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,405
you get to keep testing your team,

542
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,638
and I take the heat from Cuddy.

543
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,544
If it goes that way,
yeah, that'd be excellent.

544
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,411
His respiratory status
is through the floor.

545
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,644
If there's a vessel and
we don't remove it fast,

546
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,914
best case, he's on a
ventilator for life.

547
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,217
Granted, it'll be a short one.

548
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,852
Who do you think I should hire?

549
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,961
You want me to tell you in front of him?

550
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,896
Well, it'd be rude to
ask him to leave now.

551
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,697
If you don't do the surgery,
the patient will die.

552
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,602
You'll have had nothing to do with it,

553
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,605
and everyone will know that
you had nothing to do with it.

554
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,470
And everyone will know that it's because

555
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,509
you were pissed off at
House for firing you.

556
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,340
You know that's not why I'm saying no.

557
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,313
Yeah, but that's not
how it's gonna play out.

558
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,980
Keep him and Amber.
You'll get stuff done.

559
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,784
Prep him for surgery.

560
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,289
This isn't an anomalous vessel.

561
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,323
Look at these lymph nodes. Way too big.

562
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,924
They're the masses you saw.

563
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,824
70 over 40. He's crashing.

564
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,267
Two units of PRBCs.

565
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,805
Starting dopamine. We're losing him!

566
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,732
So, how's your game going?

567
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,141
It's not whether you win or lose.

568
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,152
Respiratory failure
and large lymph nodes.

569
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,449
Whatever this is, he's not
gonna be breathing much longer.

570
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,220
Does Foreman being here
means the game's over?

571
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,261
It means the patient's
life is almost over.

572
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,523
You can call it what you want.

573
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,792
We're done, people. Come on!

574
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,532
I need ideas. I don't
care who they come from.

575
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,231
Of course you do. This is still a game.

576
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,241
You're still gonna reward whoever gets
the right idea, punish whoever's wrong.

577
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,869
Hire who you want. Get this over with.

578
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,611
Thirteen, Kutner.

579
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,917
I'm sorry. Go home.

580
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,517
Why? It doesn't matter.

581
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:29,617
He just told me that I gotta...

582
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,127
Lungs are stiff, could be ARDS.

583
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,595
You fluid overloaded him.

584
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,655
Anyone's lungs would
leak after that surgery.

585
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,290
Goodbye. Anaphylactic shock.

586
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,493
No sign of bronchospasm.

587
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,593
What if the lymph nodes are caused by

588
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,399
chronic stimulation
of his immune system?

589
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,699
Impurities in his drugs could've...

590
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,434
Street drugs are laced
with all kinds of things.

591
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,068
An immune overreaction
would explain everything.

592
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,702
Drug diagnosis.

593
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,176
That's what you're going with?

594
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,286
That firing thing, it was all a dream.

595
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,285
Go find where he gets his
drugs and what's in them.

596
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,695
And put him on dimercaprol
for heavy metal poisoning.

597
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,031
Competition works.

598
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,673
So, you're not gonna tell
me who sells you drugs?

599
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,144
What does it matter?

600
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,414
You're dying. Does that matter?

601
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,388
Not really.

602
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,124
I'm not an adult.

603
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,430
Never wanted to be.

604
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,734
So, if the choice

605
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,071
is running out the clock with a walker,

606
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,570
and a bedpan...

607
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,681
You don't regret anything?

608
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,154
Well, there was a lot of drugs,

609
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,230
a lot of drinking, a lot of fights.

610
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,034
I regret everything else.

611
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,982
You hate me, don't you?

612
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:37,980
Yeah.

613
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,015
I don't care.

614
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,856
What's it like?

615
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,465
It means you have no regrets.

616
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,589
Kind of sticks in your head, doesn't it?

617
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,389
This guy's amazing.

618
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,820
There's not one redeeming note.

619
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,922
What sort of a lawyer tells his client

620
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,525
he's got a case because
he's going to live?

621
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,661
I've heard that not all lawyers

622
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,899
are as ethical as the ones we see on TV.

623
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,168
I don't think this guy
even has a law degree.

624
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,039
Well, the guys on TV don't, either.

625
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,409
I think he has a medical degree.

626
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,749
It directly affects my bottom line.

627
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,021
If you have less money to lend...

628
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,154
I'm trying to take responsibility.

629
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,563
And I'm trying to teach you
that everyone is out for theirs.

630
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,964
You might as well keep yours.

631
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,764
And lend it to you?

632
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,298
You have to control everything.

633
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,034
How come you're going around
asking everyone who you should fire?

634
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,871
I'm asking for input!

635
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,934
I thought you would have
admired the humility.

636
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,344
You like games because
you can control them.

637
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,541
God, I'm gonna put the record back on.

638
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,449
You like what's interesting,
never mind if it's real or good.

639
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,680
You wanna know why you
offered that guy six grand?

640
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,086
Life just happens, and that
scares the hell out of you.

641
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,715
You think you can cure pain.

642
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,123
You think you can avoid pain.

643
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,093
You think you're responsible
for every failure,

644
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,222
every patient's boring life,
every friend's screwed-up...

645
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:30,358
You don't wanna face it
anymore than my patient does.

646
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,029
Dying's easy. Living's hard.

647
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,402
That can't possibly be
as poignant as it sounded.

648
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:44,710
Still can't find the drug source,

649
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,113
but I don't think that's the problem.

650
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,617
The dimercaprol isn't working,

651
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,916
and Quidd volunteers at
a home for abandoned kids.

652
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,182
Why are you telling me this?

653
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,553
Because his bass player told me.

654
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:54,818
Is it medically relevant?

655
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:55,916
I don't know.

656
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,759
Well, then, why are you... Stop
playing games and do your job.

657
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,030
No.

658
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:18,476
This time I'm firing Taub and Amber.

659
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,980
This is a joke, right?

660
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,352
It's only a joke if you
come up with the answer.

661
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,857
It's not really funny if you don't.

662
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,455
Thirteen and Kutner, you're fired, too.

663
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,655
Foreman? He's a druggie.

664
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,167
I was never sure there was
a disease in the first place.

665
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,966
So, all we know is that he's dying.

666
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,168
Who wants to tell the patient?

667
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,869
Fine, I'll get some
kid to go talk to him.

668
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,971
It's the only people he
gets along with anyway.

669
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,311
Are we still fired?

670
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,180
He works with abandoned kids.

671
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,225
Is it medically relevant?

672
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,025
I think so.

673
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,029
I need a brain biopsy.

674
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,990
For the patient.

675
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,196
You two switch.

676
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,239
You wanna drill into
the skull of a patient

677
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,400
who almost died on the
operating table yesterday?

678
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,913
Why are they here?

679
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:27,576
Because I wouldn't have gotten
the answer without each of them.

680
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,620
You could have just told me.

681
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,245
I want you to feel guilty.

682
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,222
She thinks the patient's a loser.

683
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,883
She thinks the patient's a winner,

684
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,757
just a regular guy
with a regular problem.

685
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,422
He thinks he's gonna be
great once he's all grown up,

686
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,797
and he thinks... What did you think?

687
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,460
Autoimmune. Right.

688
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,197
Less interesting but just as important.

689
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,397
We can't all be right.

690
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,099
You're all wrong.

691
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,802
My mom always said that two
wrongs don't make a right.

692
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,471
She never said anything
about four wrongs.

693
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,537
I always found that suspicious.

694
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,879
Plain old measles,
constant exposure from

695
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,816
hanging out with Oliver
Twist and his lot.

696
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,877
I assume he's been vaccinated.

697
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,118
Patient's immune system was
shredded with years of drugs.

698
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,250
Early markers of rash and fever

699
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,794
would have been lost on a druggie.

700
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,123
His immune system overreacted,

701
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,630
which is why his body went haywire.

702
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,890
That's clever.

703
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,238
You're not doing a biopsy
without neurological symptoms.

704
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,968
If I'm right, the virus is in his brain.

705
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,067
Wrong course of treatment
could be his last course.

706
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,339
I need a neurological...

707
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,880
He kept swallowing.

708
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,439
Could be neurological, could
be a complex partial seizure.

709
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,382
What did it look like?

710
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:41,488
Good God, woman, how much
more proof do you need?

711
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,827
If you can induce a seizure,
you can have your biopsy.

712
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,762
Hoes, hup!

713
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,168
<i>We're gonna use flashing lights.</i>

714
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,262
Noxious stimulation,
it'll irritate your brain.

715
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,499
If there's damage to your neurons,

716
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,042
it'll trigger a seizure.
That way we can...

717
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,476
I got something much more noxious.

718
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:09,181
It's not as commonly used, but
sound can be just as big an irritant.

719
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,260
Now remind me of your influences here!

720
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,424
'Cause I'm gonna say Thelonious Monk

721
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,300
and the sound a trash compactor
makes when you crawl inside it.

722
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,637
I don't do it for you. I do it for me.

723
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,242
What do you think? Is
he seizing or dancing?

724
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,618
Seizing.

725
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,680
Play him the B side, it's even worse.

726
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,055
Schedule an OR for the biopsy.

727
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,287
See you in the lecture hall.

728
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:23,082
A little mood music, build the suspense.

729
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,156
Sounds more folky.

730
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,896
You seriously have no idea
when to shut up, do you?

731
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,962
Amber, please stand.

732
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,566
You didn't call me bitch. Is that bad?

733
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,611
You played the game better
than anybody else here,

734
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,717
but for the wrong reasons.

735
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,844
Reasons don't matter.
Results are the only thing...

736
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,410
You were wrong.

737
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,124
Twenty years ago, this was
recorded by Jim Moskowitz,

738
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,359
who later became known as Jimmy Quidd.

739
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:10,168
Loves kids, apparently has
a heart, perhaps even a soul.

740
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,135
If you're gonna work for me,

741
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,909
you have to be willing to
be wrong, willing to lose.

742
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,347
Because you just did.

743
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,343
You're fired.

744
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,096
Thirteen, please stand.

745
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,795
You're fired.

746
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,802
You just said I was right about...

747
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,710
He was a drug addict.

748
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,446
Four applicants, two spots.

749
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,951
If I had three, I'd keep you.

750
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,296
Game over.

751
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,986
You're gonna have to grow old after all.

752
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,753
You've got measles. We're
blasting you with corticosteroids.

753
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,325
What's wrong with you?

754
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,830
I got fired.

755
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,632
Well, what are you doing here?

756
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,301
Trying not to care.

757
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,070
Yeah?

758
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,272
That's not easy.

759
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,812
What the hell did you do?

760
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,484
You told me to hire Kutner and Taub.

761
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,924
Because I knew you wouldn't.

762
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:10,983
Oops.

763
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,790
I can't let you hire two men.

764
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,955
Now, that is sexist.

765
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,498
You've already got Foreman.

766
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,692
Is he a dude?

767
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,496
Hire a woman, too.

768
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,729
Hire two women?

769
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:23,261
You can have the one that
gives a crap about people.

770
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,868
They both do. Right.

771
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,402
Hire Thirteen.

772
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,249
This was your plan all along.

773
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,197
Well, at least the games are over.

774
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,560
How long have you known me?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
