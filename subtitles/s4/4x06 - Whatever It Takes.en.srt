1
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,898
<i>And now, coming to the line,</i>

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,807
<i>last year's Rookie of
the Year, Casey Alfonso!</i>

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:17,773
<i>In lane two, nine-time
national champion, Tony Kumer.</i>

4
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:25,288
<i>Tony's got his light on in lane two,
and now Casey is approaching the line.</i>

5
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,485
How do you feel? Great.

6
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,084
I feel like throwing up my guts.

7
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,288
You always feel like throwing up.

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,853
Come on, Dad. Let's get
this digger on the line.

9
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,489
You sure you don't
wanna go to law school?

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,591
I hate lawyers! Yeah, so do I.

11
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,192
Go get 'em, baby!

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,837
<i>Okay, looks like we're ready to go!</i>

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,810
<i>Let's hear it, folks!</i>

14
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,718
<i>And it's Casey Alfonso, by
less than half a car length!</i>

15
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,852
<i>What a spectacular finish
for the young female.</i>

16
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,224
Casey Alfonso, with an amazing finish.

17
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,458
What'd you do at the end there?

18
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,727
Yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,429
At about 250 feet, the
car got out of shape a bit,

20
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:48,530
but about halfway down, I just
got into the zone or something.

21
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,372
I pedaled it back into the groove.
It was the coolest ride of my life.

22
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,039
How does it feel to be
nine-time national champion...

23
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,213
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

24
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,520
Casey? Casey! Casey! Out
of the way. Out of the way!

25
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,932
Casey! Casey! Get me an ambulance.
Ron, get the ambulance! Casey?

26
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,399
Sixty-eight year
old male, non-smoker.

27
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,960
Sixty-eight's a good run.

28
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:55,530
That'll leave something in the
lock box for the rest of us. Next?

29
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,870
That's your breakfast?

30
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,376
Technically, it's Wilson's lunch.

31
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,378
Twenty-month old baby,
persistent rash, fever...

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
Too much crying.

33
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,343
Female college student
with... Too much drama.

34
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,440
You don't care about
the crying or the drama,

35
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,815
'cause you won't see the patient.

36
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,616
And you'd treat Methuselah if
his snot had an interesting color.

37
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,284
Means you've already decided
which case you wanna take next.

38
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,690
Tell me about speed racer.

39
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,855
Female, seizure with visual and
auditory processing deficiency.

40
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,057
I did a consult, and...

41
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,497
What kind of race car?

42
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,592
Dragster.

43
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,361
Continue.

44
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,803
You're gonna take a case
based on the car she drives?

45
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,603
Nothing says, "Thanks
for saving my life"

46
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,577
like a test drive in a car that
accelerates faster than a space shuttle.

47
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,170
You can't save her life,
'cause she's not dying.

48
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,977
Her labs show signs of dehydration,

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,041
means the problem's
just likely heatstroke.

50
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,143
Kind of hard to get heat struck
in four and a half seconds.

51
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,553
Not when you're wearing a
three-layer fireproof suit.

52
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,160
Excuse me, Dr. House?

53
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,196
No. Lazy ass called in sick again.

54
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,859
We can give him the message.

55
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,697
May we talk in private?

56
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:15,616
So, either it's heatstroke, in
which case we take the afternoon off,

57
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:20,591
or it's one of the diagnoses that you
guys are gonna have for me in two minutes.

58
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,785
You're in charge.

59
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,885
I know.

60
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,732
Cop? He's not packing.

61
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,531
Your dad's either a
cop or a security guard.

62
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,632
Or she carries a weapon.

63
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,070
You're with the CIA.

64
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,309
One of our employees just
returned from an assignment sick.

65
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,614
Now, we believe he may be the
victim of an assassination attempt.

66
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,583
Sure.

67
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,921
You wanna close the door?

68
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,517
Door?

69
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,496
Well, I assume you're gonna drop
trou at some point during the dance,

70
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,724
I don't see why I should share.

71
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,925
This isn't a joke.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,800
If you're willing to help
us, we need to leave now.

73
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,396
If I have to walk somewhere, there
better be at least five girls involved.

74
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,568
And they better be working
their way through college.

75
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,269
Okay, what have you got?

76
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,507
Hereditary brain disorder,
transient ischemia

77
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,105
or paraneoplastic syndrome.

78
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
None of those go away with
IV fluids. It's heatstroke.

79
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,787
Or Cushing's or calcium deficiency.

80
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:22,843
Who's your friend?

81
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,355
We use the term life partner.

82
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,417
Get a fresh history, neurological
exam and an MRI of her head.

83
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,984
Fifteen minutes for the lap dance,

84
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,998
a half-hour to scrub
the guilt off my soul...

85
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,033
See you in 45!

86
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,335
Dr. House, we need to hurry.

87
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,373
Yeah, we need to hurry.

88
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,532
Little advice.

89
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,305
I mean, obviously the Village People
played out the whole cop thing.

90
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,609
But come on, CIA?

91
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,775
You seriously expect
anyone to believe that?

92
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,658
It helps when you have props.

93
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,124
Keep your eye on my pen.

94
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,062
Very good.

95
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,571
Any nausea or vomiting
before the seizure?

96
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,073
No.

97
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,507
My dad had some, but he's
always like that before a race.

98
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,636
Could have been food poisoning.

99
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,475
You two eat breakfast together? No.

100
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,744
Any history of sciatica
or spinal injury?

101
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:25,943
No.

102
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,346
Abnormal deep tendon reflex.

103
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,548
Really? Let me see.

104
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,888
It's there. I didn't
say it wasn't there,

105
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,055
I said it was abnormal.

106
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,024
We're gonna give you an MRI to be sure,

107
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,467
but I'm guessing your symptoms were
caused by just dehydration in the heat.

108
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,198
You're guessing?

109
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:51,276
Look, I make a living
driving 300 miles an hour,

110
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,608
which makes the ability to stay
conscious kind of important.

111
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,306
I'm sure it's just heatstroke,

112
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,476
but we're gonna do an
MRI to be extra careful.

113
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,626
You said you left your
cell in your office.

114
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,926
I lied.

115
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,897
I wasn't going to take it.

116
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,903
Just tell you to turn
it off for take-off.

117
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:19,995
I know.

118
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,165
I just wanted to see if you
could tell that I was lying.

119
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,334
Useful information. Yeah?

120
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,434
Where are you?

121
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,207
I'm on a top-secret
mission for the CIA.

122
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:29,939
Right.

123
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,779
There was nothing on
your race car driver's CT

124
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,751
and the history and
physical were normal.

125
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,186
Her deep tendon reflexes
seemed a bit weak to me.

126
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,416
Areflexia could mean Miller Fisher.

127
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,686
Yes, areflexia could mean Miller Fisher,

128
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,526
but since the reflex was weak, not
absent, it doesn't mean anything.

129
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,791
I'm releasing her. You can
go back to your poker game.

130
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,060
Poker's illegal.

131
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,261
<i>The CIA would never
allow illegal activity.</i>

132
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,235
<i>Have you considered Miller Fisher?</i>

133
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,501
Why? What happened?

134
00:07:55,908 --> 00:08:00,072
She just had another seizure. And now
she's getting a vertical nystagmus.

135
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:12,046
We think it's Miller Fisher,
an inflammatory process.

136
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,786
In rare cases, it can cause
respiratory failure, but...

137
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,488
Wait, wait. She could stop breathing?

138
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,087
You said there was nothing
wrong. You said you were sure.

139
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,066
You just had another seizure.
Clearly there's something wrong.

140
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:26,127
So, why should I trust you
to figure out what it is?

141
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,070
Where's Dr. House?
I'm at this hospital...

142
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,505
It's gonna be all right.

143
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,543
We just need to start
the plasmapheresis.

144
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,805
No.

145
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,073
It's not going to be all right,

146
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,014
because you obviously don't
have a clue what you're doing.

147
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,143
I'm not letting you touch me.

148
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,413
Honey!

149
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,887
I wanna see House. Where is he?

150
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,563
<i>It looks a lot better on 24.</i>

151
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,573
I take that back.

152
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,778
Dr. Samira Terzi. It's a
pleasure to meet you, Dr. House.

153
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,217
We really appreciate the
consult on such short notice.

154
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,917
There's nothing that gives me more
pleasure than helping out a colleague.

155
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,220
This is Dr. Sidney Curtis
from the Mayo Clinic.

156
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,125
He's also agreed to
help with the diagnosis.

157
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,457
Dr. House.

158
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,691
<i>Curtis on Immunology, Sidney Curtis?</i>

159
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,755
You've read it?

160
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,563
Nope, but it is keeping my piano level.

161
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,898
So, where is the poor sick fella?

162
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,378
What do we do? I don't know yet.

163
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,347
She needs treatment.
This is a test, right?

164
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,441
You're reporting back
to him everything we do.

165
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,043
Yeah. And I asked the
patient to be uncooperative.

166
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,519
Personally, I think she overplayed it.

167
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,490
She's being uncooperative because
you made us all look like idiots.

168
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,752
We're only gonna look like idiots

169
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,818
if we can't figure out how to
get her to agree to the treatment.

170
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,989
What would House do right now?

171
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,727
Pop a pill, insult us
and trick the patient.

172
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,268
We can do that last part.

173
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,167
She's never met House before, has she?

174
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,226
Who's got a cane?

175
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,239
House isn't here.

176
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,639
We're not gonna act like him.

177
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,248
What do you want?

178
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,358
I'm gonna do what doctors
aren't supposed to do,

179
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,690
admit I made a mistake.

180
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,696
I shouldn't have been so
quick to dismiss your symptoms.

181
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,461
But you need to let us
start the plasmapheresis.

182
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,366
What do you want?

183
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,335
Case? Honey, do you know where you are?

184
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,603
She's burning up. Start the treatment.

185
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,079
I can't. You've got my permission.

186
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,139
She's obviously confused.
Doesn't matter anymore.

187
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,550
Miller Fisher doesn't
cause delirium and fever.

188
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,519
I don't know what this is.

189
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,090
I'm afraid there are gonna be some
limitations on his medical history.

190
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,559
Just let me know what you need
and I should be able to provide it.

191
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,530
FYI, my malpractice insurance
doesn't cover alien autopsies.

192
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,690
That's fine.

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,290
X
- files are the next wing over.

194
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,359
Where was the patient
when he first fell ill?

195
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,630
Sorry, that's classified.

196
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,196
But assume there aren't too many
places in the world John hasn't been.

197
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,571
And, yes, John's a cover name.

198
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,633
And what makes you think it
was an attempt on his life?

199
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,973
Sorry, can't tell you that, either.

200
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,014
Well, what can you tell us? Yeah.

201
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,244
Did Oswald really have
sex with Marilyn Monroe?

202
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,404
Good Lord.

203
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,972
Very professional.

204
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:53,136
Five days ago he was 185
pounds. Perfect health.

205
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:57,909
Cool.

206
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,511
Fever and delirium rule out...

207
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,322
He's not gonna hire you just
because you called him the most,

208
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,692
especially since it's obvious
he doesn't want to be called.

209
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,095
Symptoms rule out Miller
Fisher. MS fits better.

210
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,225
Progression's too fast.
More likely meningitis.

211
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,633
Areflexia doesn't fit as well with...

212
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:18,727
Does with amyloidosis.

213
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,136
That's even slower than MS. It's lupus.

214
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,765
I'm with the little man on this one.

215
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,538
It's attacking the body and
the brain, classic autoimmune.

216
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:29,638
<i>Flirt all you want, but I should
warn you, shiksas are for practice.</i>

217
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,479
Lupus this aggressive
wouldn't spare her kidneys.

218
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,610
It's primarily neurological.
Let's start her on...

219
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,450
Then why no plaques on her MRI?

220
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,989
MRI was inconclusive.

221
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,046
Start her on...

222
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,615
So, now you're sure that it's MS.

223
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,558
Just like you were sure
it was Miller Fisher.

224
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,686
An hour after you were
sure it was heatstroke.

225
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,561
The symptoms fit.
Start her on interferon.

226
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,133
We're not gonna score
any points with House

227
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,066
if we solve this just
by running your errands.

228
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,071
I get that you wanna
be right. You don't?

229
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,630
I'm just trying to save the patient,
not score points with my boss.

230
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,337
Would it hurt the patient
if you let us run some tests?

231
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,210
You've got three hours.

232
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,857
We've run six complete tox screens,

233
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,258
tested for every heavy metal, poison
and biological agent we can think of.

234
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,159
It says here he ate a lot of chestnuts.

235
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,858
Hold on a second.

236
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,527
If the squirrel liberation army
is involved, I'm out of here.

237
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,796
Those little rodents are...

238
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,338
Horse chestnuts are poisonous.
If someone switched them...

239
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,033
Horse chestnuts may look like chestnuts,

240
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,542
but they taste like a
horse's lower than chestnuts,

241
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,805
which makes the theory that he
accidentally ate a couple of hundred

242
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,938
slightly less persuasive.

243
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,777
Seeing as how he was prowling
the back alleys of Tehran...

244
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,082
It wasn't Tehran, it was...

245
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,051
You almost got me.

246
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,994
Unless we know the local environmental
factors, the poisonous flora...

247
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,496
You know I can't tell you that.

248
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,296
Well, then why are we here? You
might as well just Google "poison. "

249
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,702
All they would tell me is he spent
the last 11 months in Bolivia.

250
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,936
Who you gonna kill in
Bolivia? My old housekeeper?

251
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,067
We don't kill people.

252
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,578
I'm sorry, who are
you gonna marginalize?

253
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,240
If it is my housekeeper,
she has it coming.

254
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,977
Cleaning the windows
means cleaning both sides.

255
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,745
Am I right or am I right?

256
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,787
What does it matter what he was doing?

257
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,788
The guy's dying. Not anymore.

258
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,256
I know what's poisoning him, and who.

259
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,588
John.

260
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,262
It's just pancreatitis.

261
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,662
He's not an alcoholic.

262
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,893
And unless his pancreas
is in his fingers...

263
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,731
Spies can't get fungal infections?

264
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,031
And the burns on his skin?

265
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,901
Spies can't get sunburns?

266
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,167
Bolivia doesn't have sun?

267
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,677
So, either we go with his
theory of the non-drinking drunk,

268
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,678
or he was poisoned by some group

269
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,613
with the resources to make
it completely untraceable,

270
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,844
some customized isotope.

271
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,752
Let's treat for radiation poisoning.

272
00:14:55,494 --> 00:15:01,592
The iodine's to protect your thyroid.
Antibiotics are to handle infections.

273
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,726
Should start working
in a couple of hours.

274
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,203
We should celebrate
with a beer or eight.

275
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,741
I don't drink.

276
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,107
Oh, methinks he doth protest too much.

277
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,305
He's deathly ill. Why
would he lie about drinking?

278
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,545
Guilt over killing a man would
make anyone hit the sauce.

279
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,643
We don't kill people.

280
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,778
Right.

281
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,050
You just lie to your friends and family,

282
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,490
establish false identities, trick
people into betraying their country.

283
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,121
He'd never cover up his
drinking. He's too honest.

284
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,132
Hey! Something I've
always wanted to know.

285
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,828
That poison lipstick that
Ginger used to kiss Gilligan,

286
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,064
why didn't that kill her?

287
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,076
Okay, drum roll!

288
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,842
LP is negative for meningitis.

289
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,180
Sorry, Cole.

290
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,211
Fat pad biopsy is... Wait for it...

291
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,684
Negative for amyloidosis
and Thirteen goes down!

292
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,126
Could we hurry this up? My son has...

293
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,663
Can I have a kid, too?
I'm working too hard.

294
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,857
I could hook you up.

295
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,490
If I had two minutes and
some anti-nausea meds,

296
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,592
I'd take you up on that.

297
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,500
And for the gold...

298
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,337
Protein's 65, glucose, 70.

299
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,036
It's MS, start her on interferon.

300
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,135
Now, turn to the last page.

301
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,442
Sed rate's 95, ANA's weakly positive.

302
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,537
Positive, it's lupus.

303
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,446
Weakly, not lupus. It's MS.

304
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,508
We obviously don't know
what it is. Treat for both.

305
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,349
No. I gave in on the tests.

306
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,912
We're not treating her for two
completely separate diseases

307
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,050
because you think lupus
will win you a prize.

308
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,863
Still think it's lupus?

309
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:42,958
Yeah.

310
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,434
Me, too.

311
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,767
In case of emergency,
go to the emergency room.

312
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,564
Could be lupus.

313
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,041
That's what we figured.

314
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,237
Then why are you here?

315
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,405
You're an immunologist.
We wanted to confirm...

316
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,416
Who are you looking for me to help you
sell down the river? House or Cuddy?

317
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,951
Foreman.

318
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,653
Sorry. He's pushing MS.

319
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,881
Thinks that because he's in charge,

320
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,924
he has to prove he's the
smartest guy in the room.

321
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,619
All I've heard about you, you put
the patient above everything else.

322
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,719
That's why everyone
finds you so annoying.

323
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,060
All House cares about
is results. I know.

324
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,932
I'm talking about how
to deal with Foreman.

325
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,334
So am I.

326
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,405
Fever's down to 101.5.

327
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,636
Treatment's working.
Why are we out here?

328
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,234
Trying to figure out
which treatment's working.

329
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,143
It's kind of tacky doing
it in front of the patient.

330
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,909
You put her on steroids, too?

331
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:31,972
We had no choice.

332
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,040
The sed rate pointed to lupus.

333
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,278
And the ANA ruled it out!

334
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,650
Doctors!

335
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,351
Legs hurt?

336
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,121
I can't feel them at all. I
don't think I can move them.

337
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,875
Vitals stabilizing.

338
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,207
Tummy ache's gone as well.

339
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,544
So, the treatment's working.

340
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,981
You wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy
and hop on the company jet?

341
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,387
Little trip down Mexico way,

342
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,325
and I'm not talking about
the country or the plane.

343
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,126
Do you think acting like an idiot
and talking about sex works on girls?

344
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,599
Well, if it didn't, the human
race would have died out long ago.

345
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,862
You're pretty cheery for someone

346
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,268
who was just proved wrong
about his pancreatitis theory.

347
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,738
I'm appropriately cheery for
someone who's been proved right.

348
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,173
John hasn't vomited in six hours.

349
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,076
What's to vomit? I'm eating his lunch.

350
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,647
Withholding nutrients is the
treatment for pancreatitis.

351
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,513
That, and the antibiotics
you put him on.

352
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,553
I did unhook your iodine, though.

353
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,748
Didn't seem to fit with the whole "I'm
just jerking you guys around" Gestalt.

354
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,051
You're unbelievable.

355
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,650
Let's ask John if he'd rather be
sick honestly or cured dishonestly.

356
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,720
John? John?

357
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,173
Any chance he's just
overwhelmed with gratitude?

358
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,622
Paralysis.

359
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,923
It's a new symptom?

360
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,696
Big white space on the
board where it would fit.

361
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,255
Nice, multicolored markers.

362
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,598
I'm not writing it because we
can't know if it's a real symptom.

363
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,001
When these two went rogue and pumped
her full of steroids, we lost...

364
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,733
Steroids don't cause paralysis.

365
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,741
She was also on interferon.

366
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,369
Giving her both probably
fried her immune system.

367
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,844
Who knows what infection
you could cause...

368
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,905
We consulted an immunologist,
she said we have...

369
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,246
She? You talking about Dr. Cameron?

370
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,411
She thought lupus was... She
tell you to start treating?

371
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,648
Yes! They've ignored
you, they screwed up

372
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,656
and it's fun watching you spank them.

373
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,089
But, can we get back to the medicine?

374
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,152
The last thing any of you give
a damn about is the medicine.

375
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,729
Look.

376
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm not saying you're
bad doctors or bad people.

377
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,731
But House is.

378
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,433
He created a nasty
little cutthroat world,

379
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,703
planted you in it, and
is watching you play.

380
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,836
And none of it works
for anyone except him.

381
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,712
And whoever wins.

382
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,182
Given its quick progression,
we gotta assume botulism.

383
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,450
I'll go to her place. Check
out her fridge and pantry.

384
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,891
It's not botulism. It's polio.

385
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,429
Brilliant. We should search her home
for FDR's remains or a time machine.

386
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,993
She could have contracted it from
anyone who's been to Africa, or...

387
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,403
She's been vaccinated.

388
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,497
Vaccines wear off.

389
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,737
There hasn't been a single
American case in over 20 years.

390
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,302
I've seen this disease.
I know what it looks like.

391
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,144
That's why you're finding it,
because you're looking for it.

392
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,308
Polio?

393
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,249
It's crazy. House wouldn't think so.

394
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,583
So, go find House and
tell him your theory.

395
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,419
Take a personal day.
Seriously. Get out of here.

396
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,361
You don't have the power to fire me.

397
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,023
But I do have the power to
kick your ass off my case.

398
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,125
I'm starting the botulism treatment.

399
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,400
The rest of you, look for confirmation.

400
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,212
He should be brought up on charges.

401
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,909
Okay, relax.

402
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,076
I'll take your book
out from under my piano.

403
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,881
He's dying of radiation
sickness. He's obviously in pain.

404
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,219
All of which could have been
avoided if you hadn't interfered...

405
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,221
What was that for?

406
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,695
Radiation sickness kills
specific cells at specific times.

407
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,528
His hair should be coming out in
clumps before he's writhing in pain.

408
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,899
Since it's not, I know
who's trying to kill him.

409
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,099
God.

410
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,866
It's blood cancer, Waldenstrom's.

411
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,068
Radiation can cause infections,
which set off neuropathy...

412
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,635
If you had any real
evidence of foul play,

413
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,738
you'd be torturing Bolivians

414
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,444
instead of putting me into a state
of anticipatory sexual arousal.

415
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,814
Can we treat for both?

416
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,549
Bad idea. Unless you're the
one who's trying to poison him.

417
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,559
I'll arrange for
plasmapheresis and chemo.

418
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,492
Are you gonna trust
him after what he did?

419
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,655
I don't have to trust
him to agree with him.

420
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,161
You make a good point.

421
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,105
I've been wrong every time and
she still won't listen to you.

422
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,612
So, either she really likes
me or she really hates you.

423
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,977
And I got a ride in the jet.

424
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,684
Oh, hi. What are you doing here?

425
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,120
Just came to say hi.

426
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,283
Hi again.

427
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,350
Where's Mrs. Bearman?

428
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,519
Sent her home.

429
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,357
I was scheduling her for an MRA.

430
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,954
If we gave MRAs to every
patient with a headache...

431
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,694
This wasn't just a headache,
it was the worst in her life.

432
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,292
And lucky for you, I'm a neurologist.

433
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,237
She went to a wine and cheese
tasting. Both triggers for migraines.

434
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,637
She's never had a migraine before.

435
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,140
And I never had a blueberry bagel,

436
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,471
but for the first time I had one.

437
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,771
Bagels don't kill people.

438
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,836
This is a classic ticking bomb aneurism.

439
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,973
Wow. This taught me a lesson.

440
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,314
I guess when I mess with
other people's patients,

441
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,184
I risk looking like an officious bitch.

442
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,427
We're gonna have to
track down Mrs. Bearman.

443
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,257
Wait. Never mind.

444
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:24,991
It's funny.

445
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,731
It's not funny, it's totally immature.

446
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:27,930
It is funny.

447
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,133
You just can't appreciate
it, because you're the victim.

448
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,836
Yeah. I deserve shame and
ridicule for offering a consult.

449
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,503
Unheard of for a doctor.

450
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,513
You didn't offer a medical consult.

451
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,708
You offered a
dealing-with-Foreman consult.

452
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,242
For the good of the patient.
It's what House would have done.

453
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,448
Maybe House will hear about
it and tear up with pride.

454
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,115
You think I'm trying to impress him.

455
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,888
I think that for someone
who's not involved in his team,

456
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,521
you're remarkably involved in his team.

457
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,531
Let it go.

458
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,089
Let him go.

459
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,134
And that's mature.

460
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,809
One-twenty over 80. Let 'er rip.

461
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,479
Now we got the medical
stuff out of the way,

462
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,149
why don't we meet back at your place

463
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,716
for some enhanced
interrogation techniques?

464
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,093
My safe word is, "Help,
please, please, stop. "

465
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,758
It's two pleases. Anything
less than that, you keep going.

466
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,998
You actually cure this guy, I'll
show you my private water board.

467
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,838
We need to consult an
oncologist about the chemo.

468
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,314
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were still euphemizing.

469
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,679
My valet knows a little oncology.

470
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,982
I was wondering when you'd
grow bored of avoiding my calls.

471
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,924
Oh, I could never grow
bored of ignoring you.

472
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,155
What's the latest
protocol on Waldenstrom's?

473
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,252
Where are you?

474
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,026
CIA headquarters.

475
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,191
<i>How much fludarabine do you need...</i>

476
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,997
Either you're sprawled naked on your
floor with an empty bottle of Vicodin

477
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,798
or collapsed naked in
front of your computer

478
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,567
with an empty bottle of Viagra.

479
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,733
Please tell me which, because
Chase has another pool going.

480
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,970
They flew me in to help
deal with a sick employee.

481
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,204
<i>How much... Hallucinations?</i>

482
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,439
<i>Damn, I shouldn't have
bet on the Viagra. Okay.</i>

483
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,116
Call the Langley switchboard,
ask for extension...

484
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,880
Thirty-five, seventy-eight.
Three, five, seven, eight.

485
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,354
He asked an awful lot
of questions for a valet.

486
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:29,359
You know, I happen to have a
position available on my penis.

487
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,529
Wait a second, I think
I screwed up that joke.

488
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,431
You offering me a job?

489
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,231
I'd settle for that.

490
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:43,831
As tempting as a position on
your staff is, I like it here.

491
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,434
Pays better, and we've only
had one assassination attempt.

492
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,035
And I'm sure you're a great boss.

493
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:52,049
That's why your fellows left
en masse a couple of months ago.

494
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,244
I have satellite images.

495
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,551
Inspector Gadget?

496
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,257
My God, you're actually at the CIA.

497
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,457
You've gotta get down here.

498
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,161
They've got a satellite aimed
directly into Cuddy's vagina.

499
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,865
I told them the chances of
invasion are slim to none, but...

500
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,635
Waldenstrom's.

501
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,404
Recommended dose is 25
milligrams per meter squared.

502
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,809
They do a background check on you?

503
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,278
Twenty-five milligrams.

504
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,541
They did a background check on you,

505
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,140
they did a background
check on your friends.

506
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,085
Relax. I'm sure they already know that
you brought heroin back from Afghanistan.

507
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,452
<i>That's not true.</i>

508
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,957
I've never been to Afghanistan.

509
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,954
House?

510
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,489
She's getting worse.

511
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,624
Her fever's risen slightly.

512
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,638
But it's definitely... What? Botulism?

513
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,442
Right? Because if you're wrong again,

514
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,944
and you're treating her for something
that she doesn't even have...

515
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,573
The anti-toxin hasn't
had time to work yet.

516
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,584
I know it's hard, but try to be patient.

517
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,854
Excuse me.

518
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:13,857
I know you're pissed I interrupted,

519
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,025
but you're gonna be even
more pissed in a second.

520
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,693
You tested her without telling me?

521
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,535
Yeah. I know, I'm really,
really sorry, but...

522
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,200
On the other hand, it's positive.

523
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,305
She has polio.

524
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,243
Now what, boss?

525
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,711
Where's House?

526
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,353
He's blown off four hours of clinic.

527
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,060
He's consulting for the CIA.

528
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,693
Seriously, call Langley,

529
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:54,068
and ask for extension three,
five... It's three, five, three, six?

530
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,605
It's definitely two threes.

531
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,766
I wrote it down. I have it somewhere.

532
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,175
He's gonna make up twice his
skipped hours in the clinic.

533
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,713
Okey-doke.

534
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,375
And for protecting him, you're
gonna make up twice that.

535
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,509
Why are you punishing me worse than him?

536
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,349
Because House never learns. You might.

537
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,122
How are you feeling?

538
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,429
Like crap.

539
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,970
Yeah. Cancer can be that way.

540
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,964
My hair is falling out.

541
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,277
Is that the chemo?

542
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,447
No, that's too quick.

543
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,119
So, what does it mean?

544
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,058
It means you don't have cancer.

545
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,292
Someone actually did try to kill you.

546
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,796
You're stubborn. You're arrogant!

547
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,896
There's no need to yell.

548
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,636
You may have cost that man his life.

549
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,439
He's getting the radiation treatment.

550
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,774
Twenty-four hours too late.

551
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,179
I didn't yell at you when
I thought you were wrong.

552
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,510
I wasn't wrong.

553
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,846
This isn't productive.

554
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,785
There is no "productive," it's too late!

555
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,824
Because of your inexperience,
your poor judgment

556
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,018
and your failure to
recognize a reckless fool.

557
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,159
Cordyceps sinensis.

558
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,903
It's an herbal treatment
derived from a parasitic fungus.

559
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,204
Comes from caterpillars.

560
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,209
Along with dimercaprol chelation,

561
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,176
it's been shown to
mitigate bone marrow damage

562
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,976
from radiation poisoning

563
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,548
in monkeys.

564
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,483
Sorry. I was stubborn and arrogant.

565
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,458
Self-recriminations won't help her.

566
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,518
Nothing's gonna help
her, she's got polio.

567
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,119
There's no cure, but
there are treatments.

568
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,289
No, she's dying.

569
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,765
Yeah, every death's a tragedy.

570
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,198
Funny how you weren't so depressed

571
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,430
when she was just dying
because me and Amber screwed up.

572
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,836
And I'm also self-centered,
thanks for clarifying.

573
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,034
Don't forget self-pitying.

574
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,409
Vitamin C. Extremely high doses.

575
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,175
It was experimental treatment
protocol in the '50s...

576
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,443
And they haven't finished yet?

577
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,075
They lost funding.

578
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,087
That's because there's no logical
reason vitamin C would cure polio.

579
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,679
Well, someone thought there was.

580
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,282
Someone thought black people
made excellent farm implements.

581
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,860
I'm not talking about hurting anyone.

582
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,793
I just want to force-feed
her some orange juice.

583
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:35,559
You wanna throw in some
bacon and eggs as well?

584
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,033
If there's anything you learned today,

585
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,536
it's gotta be that you can be wrong.

586
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,149
John, can you hear me?

587
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,078
We're gonna start you on
an experimental treatment.

588
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,051
Tea?

589
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,791
It's a Chinese herb
which has been effective.

590
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,761
I'm dying, aren't I?

591
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,665
Probably.

592
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,343
We're gonna attempt an
experimental protocol.

593
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,435
A new drug?

594
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,208
An old one. Vitamin C.

595
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,977
Ultra-high doses have been shown

596
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,178
to destroy the polio virus
and heal nerve damage.

597
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,187
She could regain use of her legs?

598
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,655
It's unlikely.

599
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,789
But we're gonna try.

600
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,519
Don't give up.

601
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,604
Nausea's not as bad.

602
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,447
Radiation sickness has a latency period.

603
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,417
You'll get better before you get worse.

604
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,062
Wanna know what I really did down there?

605
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,726
Only if it's interesting.

606
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,665
The women there,

607
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,841
during Carnival, they...

608
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,074
They do this dance.

609
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,609
They call it the devil dance.

610
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,512
Not interesting.

611
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,858
I spent the whole 40 days with this

612
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,425
attaché to the Minister of Defense.

613
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,630
The most buttoned-down
woman you'd ever meet,

614
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,541
except when she did this dance.

615
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,237
She agreed to tell me stuff.

616
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:16,057
Okay, you got half a good story there.

617
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,057
Karma.

618
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:25,835
Best way to rid yourself of that
guilt is to confess your sins.

619
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:32,102
This pain, it's right. It's comforting.

620
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,843
It makes me think that
somehow it all makes sense.

621
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,275
What do you mean 40 days?

622
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,919
When they found out

623
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,515
what she'd told me...

624
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,023
Carnival in Bolivia's only eight days.

625
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,527
You have any idea what
a chestnut looks like?

626
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,141
You idiot!

627
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,837
Who are you calling an idiot?

628
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:12,177
Whoever knew that John was
stationed in Brazil, not Bolivia.

629
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,241
Brazil?

630
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,320
Well, then, I guess I'm
talking to you, idiot.

631
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,550
It's the same region. It's the
same parasites, same diseases.

632
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,750
But not the same language.

633
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,486
In Bolivia, chestnuts are chestnuts.

634
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,893
<i>Brazil, on the other
hand, has castanhas-do-pára</i>

635
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,363
literally, chestnuts from Pára,

636
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:32,164
because it would be stupid for people
from Brazil to call them Brazil nuts.

637
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,830
So, he ate Brazil nuts. Big deal.

638
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,397
No, he ate a lot of Brazil
nuts, which is a big deal,

639
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,770
because they contain selenium,

640
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,539
which in high doses causes
fatigue, vomiting, skin irritation,

641
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,548
discharge from the
fingernail beds and hair loss.

642
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,016
Any of that sounding familiar?

643
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,516
Can you treat it?

644
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,952
We already started.

645
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,220
Treatment's chelation, the
same as for radiation sickness.

646
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,526
The only difference is it works
a lot better on nut poisoning.

647
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,589
So, what's the problem?

648
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,229
You're an idiot.

649
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,746
Why is she shivering?

650
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,286
Low serum calcium is a side
effect of the treatment.

651
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,218
I can give her a calcium supplement.

652
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,654
My arm hurts.

653
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:30,124
The infusion rate has to remain
high for the treatment to work.

654
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,354
Is it working?

655
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,094
You feel that?

656
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,562
Yeah, it hurts.

657
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,136
It's working! This is fantastic.

658
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,846
There's a lot you could
learn at my fellowship.

659
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,816
If you knew the procedures
I could teach you...

660
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,511
Of course, we'd need a nurse to prep.

661
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,284
I know how to kill a man with my thumb.

662
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,156
Actually, I was just trying to
make another euphemism for sex.

663
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,489
So was I.

664
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,655
Oh, God. How can you
flirt with this idiot?

665
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:11,394
He lied to us again and again.
He broke laws, ethical codes...

666
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,959
I was right.

667
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,106
That doesn't mean everything.

668
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,771
It means a lot.

669
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:24,481
Dr. Curtis, Dr. House.
I appreciate your help.

670
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,757
Hey. Hey.

671
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:57,042
When you were dying,

672
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,048
you tried to infect me,

673
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,175
because you knew I'd fight for you

674
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,719
if I thought I was dying, too.

675
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,984
Are you bringing this up now so I'll
forgive you for messing with my patient?

676
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,651
I'm happy I changed jobs.

677
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:13,452
But I know I'll never have that sort of

678
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,723
excitement.

679
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,300
You miss people trying to kill you?

680
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,460
No.

681
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:23,337
I miss people doing whatever
it takes to get the job done.

682
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,648
I guess that's why I'm
having trouble giving it up.

683
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,642
I shouldn't have helped
them mess with your patient.

684
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,251
They had to screw with me.
I've gotten everything wrong.

685
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,184
I don't believe it.

686
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,027
You're not gonna get everything right.

687
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,726
But you're never gonna
get everything wrong.

688
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,120
Morning!

689
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,694
Where have you been the last two days?

690
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,822
Overslept. We saved speed racer.

691
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,867
She had polio. We
cured it with vitamin C.

692
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,799
Yeah. I cured depression
with tonic water once.

693
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,806
Actually, I think there
was some gin in it, too.

694
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,400
A hundred and fifty
grams over six hours.

695
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,466
It worked.

696
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,445
No, it didn't.

697
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,880
I told you, you can't cure polio.

698
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,045
It means either she's not
cured or she never had it.

699
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:48,490
Since she's walking out of here,
I tested her blood from admittance.

700
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,059
No polio.

701
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,822
Means Brennan screwed up the lab tests.

702
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,454
Or you screwed up your lab tests.

703
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,964
You must have. She got better.

704
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,399
So, it's relapsing and
remitting. Maybe porphyria.

705
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,428
Well, that's a stretch.

706
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,735
If she had porphyria, you'd
have seen purple urine.

707
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,777
You think it's more
likely he cured polio?

708
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,976
Well, they believe it.

709
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,606
Her symptoms fit perfectly.

710
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,016
Any alternative is
unbelievably convoluted.

711
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,850
Some doctor would have to poison her
with thallium so it looks like polio,

712
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,891
then fake a lab test,
then give her vitamin C

713
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,655
and stop the poison so
she magically gets better.

714
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,289
Actually, it is kind of doable, right?

715
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,165
So, what do you think?

716
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,968
Shall we test her for thallium
before you contact Stockholm?

717
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,403
You poisoned her?

718
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,405
The really shocking thing

719
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,380
is that Foreman was right
about the heatstroke.

720
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,417
Vitamin C cures polio. I've seen it.

721
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,613
Yeah. In some bush clinic.

722
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,952
You needed polio in a
place with a proper lab.

723
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:57,323
The only problem is that places
with proper labs don't have polio.

724
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:04,859
There is no money in finding cures for
diseases that only kill poor people.

725
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,461
This will make them do research.

726
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,134
What do you care if I faked a lab test,

727
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,041
if it saves a few thousand lives?

728
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,171
I did what I had to do.

729
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,739
Isn't that what you hired us for?

730
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,384
Which is why I'm not gonna fire you.

731
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,221
You're gonna quit.

732
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,486
Go on, get out of here.

733
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,802
So, you're just gonna let him go?

734
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,238
Absolutely.

735
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:48,236
And I'm gonna let him get as far away
as possible before you call the cops.

736
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,678
Guy's a nut job.

737
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,808
Who the hell did I leave in charge?

738
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,010
Foreman.

739
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:58,748
There was a reason for that.
Next time, listen to him.

740
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,002
Where have you been?
And don't say the CIA.

741
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,901
Okay.

742
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,563
By the way, one of my employees...

743
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,471
Either you're gonna have
to get someone from the CIA

744
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,032
to call and confirm your story,

745
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,410
or you're doing eight clinic
hours and Wilson is doing 16.

746
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,180
I was in the Hamptons.

747
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:36,454
I was helping some rich hedge
fund jerk treat his son's sniffles.

748
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,790
Fascinating as that sounds.

749
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,399
For your honesty, I
will forgive your hours.

750
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,103
Thank you.

751
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,439
No!

752
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,641
The only thing less likely
than your helping the CIA

753
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,376
is your helping some
rich guy in Long Island.

754
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,044
You're doing your hours and Wilson's.

755
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,110
I know how to kill a man with my thumb.

756
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,654
Who doesn't?

757
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,492
Hi.

758
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:17,825
Hi.

759
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,900
I'm gonna take you up on your offer.

760
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,104
Yeah?

761
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,349
Well, I live a couple
of miles from here.

762
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,119
That's not the offer I meant.

763
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,815
I gave notice today.

764
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,055
You said you were happy at the company.

765
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,358
I lied.

766
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,932
Doubt you'll hold it against me.

767
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,641
I'll see you at 9:00 on Monday.

9999
