Guys, I know we
sort of ruled out infection,

172
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,756
but if we forget the Iabs
for a minute,

173
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,891
there is one infection
we didn't test for
because of her age.

174
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,832
Neurosyphilis.
There's no way.

175
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,837
If the infection dipped into
her cerebral cortex,

176
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,600
all peripheral functions
could be compromised.

177
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,198
No. She hasn't had sex.
She's nine.

178
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:54,178
Maybe it wasn't her idea.
I mean, she's been around
a Iot of adults.

HOUSE: I rest my case.

187
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,868
A regular 9-year-old girl
does not have sex
on the brain,

188

not when a doctor's
threading a catheter
through her vein.

189

on the other hand...
She wanted one kiss,
before she dies.

192
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,887
If she's never kissed a boy,
it's a fair bet
she's never had sex.

193
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,789

who won't kiss me
on the mouth.

194
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,889
Hey, here's a theory.
She has been molested,

195
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,023
seeks refuge
in romantic fantasies with
older men with great hair,

196

You did it, didn't you?
You kissed her.

199
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:06,608
It wasn't sick.
It was one kiss
for a dying girl.

200

One small kiss

She's not fine.

216
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:47,181
Her sat percentage
dropped another point.
Which could suggest
a tumor in her Iung.

217
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,284
Lung wouldn't explain
the hallucination.

218

CT scans showed
both Iungs were clean.

219

there's a tumor in her heart.
Not a chance! Give me that.

00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,606
A 9-year-old
with terminal cancer

322
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,308
gets an unrelated benign tumor
growing in her heart.

323
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,748
Why?
It's benign?
That's impossible.

324
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,082
Talk to Wilson.
And the retinal bleed,
another coincidence?

325
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,622
A clot could create pressure
behind the eye,
cause the bleeding.

326
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,318
A clot could explain the eye,
but doesn't explain
the hallucinations.

327
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,552
A clot could cause
mini seizures.

328
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,754
Great. Another thing
that's not causing
the hallucinations.

329
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,989
FOREMAN: Post-seizure
psychosis.

330
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,794
The brain sort of
corrects itself after
the seizure by hallucinating.

331
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,925
The clot
could explain the eye
and the hallucinations,

332
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,060
but what about the tumor?

333
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,832
Tumors the size of an octopus
wrapped around
a Iittle girl's heart

334
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,066
are not just a coincidence.

335
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,732
She's not healthy,
she's never been healthy.

336
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,175
WILSON: What's the theory
here? This girl's body's
a Iemon?

337
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,872
Faulty manufacturing,
everything's falling apart?

338
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:34,852
The tumor is Afghanistan,
the clot is Buffalo.

339
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,386
Does that need
more explanation? Okay.

340
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,683
The tumor is AI-Qaeda,
the big bad guy, the brains.

341
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,889
We went in, wiped it out,
but it had already
sent out a splinter cell.

342
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:50,128
A small team of Iow-Ievel
terrorists quietly Iiving
in some suburb of Buffalo,

343
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,294
waiting to kill us all.

344
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,033
Are you trying to say
the tumor threw a clot
before we removed it?

345
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,702
It was an excellent metaphor.

346
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:02,240
Angio her brain
before this clot
straps on an explosive vest.

347
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,493
HOUSE: Angio was clean.

348
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,730
There's no clot?
There's a clot,
we just can't find it.

349
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,037
You can't do
exploratory surgery
on her brain.

350
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,544
Are you sure
you're not a neurologist?

351
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,873
(SIGHS)

352
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,841
Okay.

353
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:44,143
She's gonna die.
Well, the clot's
not gonna go away quietly.

354
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,748
It could blow at any time.

355
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,795
Are you gonna Iet them know?
I guess so.

356
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:56,089
Can I come with?
To tell Andie she's gonna die?

357
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,701
That's very un-you.
She's such a brave girl.

358
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,503
I wanna see how brave she is
when you tell her
she's gonna die.

359
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,776
Go to hell.

360
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,979
(CRYING)

361
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,343
What would you do
if you were told
you were gonna die?

362
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,637
I don't know,
I'd be devastated.
You'd cry Iike a baby.

363
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,313
Everybody would.

364
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:49,447
She's not doing anything.
She's a rock.
She's brave.

365
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,411
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why?

366
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,788
She's gone through
more than most people do
in a Iifetime.

367
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,851
So what?
Does that mean
she's ready to die?

368
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,996
What if her bravery
is a symptom?

369
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,932
The clot is causing
hallucinations and messing
with her emotions.

370
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,231
You think her bravery
is chemically based?

371
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,238
It would tell us
where to Iook for the clot.
Where's the fear center?

372
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:12,299
The amygdala, near the
hippocampus. It's a big area
and a busy one.

373
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,073
You blindly cut in there,
you'II kill her.

374
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,382
Only time you're gonna
see this clot is at autopsy.

375
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,183
Then Iet's do that.

376
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,357
Is it still illegal
to perform an autopsy
on a Iiving person?

377
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,420
Are you high?
If it's Tuesday, I'm wasted.

378
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,290
It's Wednesday.

379
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,063
I want to induce
a hypothermic cardiac arrest.

380
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,299
Once the patient's on bypass,
we siphon off
two Iiters of blood,

381
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,102
perfuse the brain
while she's in an MRI.

382
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,664
You're actually
talking about killing her.

383
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,711
Just for a Iittle while.
I'II bring her right back.

384
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,804
Oh, well, in that case,
go ahead. Why are we
even talking?

385
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,816
If we do nothing,
she's dead in a day,
maybe a week.

386
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,812
The kind that Iasts.

387
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,557
We need FDA approval
for any surgical technique

388
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,524
that's used
for diagnostic purposes.
Absolutely.

389
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,858
If we were doing
anything invasive. But
there's nothing invasive...

390
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,530
You know,
I'm not cutting into her head.
I'm just Iooking for a clot.

391
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,003
Not invasive?
You're killing her.

392
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,938
Don't split hairs.
If it works, she Iives.

393
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,670
(SIGHS)

394
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,708
Make sure the mom understands
that this is
a million-to-one shot.

395
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,551
I'II see that Wilson
passes that along.

396
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,019
The plan is

397
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,620
basically
to reboot your daughter.

398
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,228
Like a computer.
We shut her down.
Then restart her.

399
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,933
How do you restart
a 9-year-old girl?

400
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,304
We cool
her core body temperature
to 21 degree Celsius.

401
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,744
Use blankets, ice.
Sort of Iike hibernation?

402
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,408
Not quite. In hibernation,
a bear's heartbeat
is just very slow.

403
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:02,579
In cardiac arrest,
there is no heartbeat.
So she's dead.

404
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,785
Temporarily, yes.

405
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,757
By cooling her,
we Iimit the risk of damage
when we remove her blood.

406
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,756
Not all of it,
two to three Iiters.
Half her blood?

407
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,797
Then we put it back.
It's called
perfusing the circuit.

408
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,766
In this case, her brain.

409
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,569
And using an MRI,
we'd have a very brief window

410
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,440
to hopefully see
the outline of the clot.

411
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,509
If it's there,
and it's operable,
we go get it.

412
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,116
And Andie walks out of here.

413
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,328

You sound better.

417
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:01,038
I stacked a combo
of Mentholatum, a few Vicodin,

418
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,979
and something else
which I can't remember.

419
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,709
Should be able
to ride the high
for a couple hours.

420
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,356
What did Andie say?
About what?

421
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,920
About this?
I didn't talk to her.

422
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,596
She doesn't need to know
the specifics
of this procedure.

423
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,430
What if you're right
about her?

424
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,301
What if
she just is that brave?

425
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,966
That doesn't mean
she's mature enough to handle
this kind of decision.

426
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,671
Either she understands,
or she's not brave.
You can't have it both ways.

427
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,112
If she does understand,

428
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,150
then she deserves to know
what's going on.

could take 10 hours.

you might not even
make it through.

My mom's done
a Iot of research.
How do you feel about it?

435
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,005
If we figured maturity came
from how much time
you've got Ieft

436
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,107
instead of how Iong
you've been here,
this would be your call.

I don't have a choice, right?

438
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,752
I could give you one.

wouldn't want that.

00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,048
Nobody wants to die.

if you want this to be over.

What would you tell my mom?

00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,648
I would give her
10 excellent medical reasons

why we can't
do this procedure.

either.

Once Andie is cooled
and goes off bypass,

464
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:47,663
we have 60 seconds
to get two Iiters of blood
out of her body,

back into her for the pictures

is bumped tomorrow,

while my MRI is on,
these red Iights will go off.

468

00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,085

my hand slipped.
How hard can this be?

486
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,058
It's a Iittle busy down here.
Again!

have to Iavage
her gastrointestinal...

489
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,197
Again!

490
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,667
Again!

491
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,567
We could bolt it to the table.

492
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,513
Gruesome and Iow-tech.
Kiss me, I Iove it.

493
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,479
A five, six, seven, eight!

Here you go, Doctor.

495

A Iot of people.
Big musical number, kiddo.

497
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:26,870
A Iot of people here
to make you Iook good.
You're kind of
freaking me out.

498
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,905
He gets that sometimes.

499
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,098
Deep breath, honey.

500
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,746
Okay, go!

501
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,052
Intubate her.

502
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,546
FEMALE TECHNICIAN: Is that one
okay?

503
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,565
FEMALE TECHNICIAN: Charge.

504
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,872
Here.

HOUSE: Start the cooling.

507
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,291
You, go.

508
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,334
She's shivering.

DR. MURPHY: We have afib.

512
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,751
What?
She's dead,
that's the whole idea.

513
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,085
Go!

514
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,589
ANESTHESIOLOGIST:
One Iiter out.

515
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,172
Two Iiters.

516
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,035
Okay, put the blood back in.
Reperfuse the circuit.

517
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,409
Anything, people,
anything at all.

518
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,348
NEUROSURGEON 1 : Internal
carotid artery in cavernous
sinus is fine.

Middle meningeal artery clear.
NEUROSURGEON 2: Five seconds!

521
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,752
Nothing.

522
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,655
NEUROSURGEON 2:
We're over the Iimit. We've
got to start rewarming her

523
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,788
or there'II be
permanent damage.

524
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,355
Keep Iooking!

525
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,159
There!

526
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,896
I didn't see anything.
It was there.

527
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,430
You sure?

528
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,839
Four millimeters
Iateral to the hippocampus,
I saw it.

529
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,275
NEUROSURGEON 2: House,
she's out of time,
she's gonna be a vegetable.

530
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,642
I saw it!

531
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,176
That's good enough for me.

532
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:09,925
They were able to restart
her heart. She's doing as well
as could be hoped.

533
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,763
PAM: So they found the clot?
We think so.

534
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,237
The neurosurgeons
are attempting to remove it
right now.

535
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,905
And when will we know
if there was any damage?

536
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,409
A few hours.

That's where I am.
There's nothing there.

541
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,358
You're not there yet,
keep going.
I'm there.

542
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,159
Are you sure you saw...
There it is.

543
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,325
I think I can get it.

544
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,285
Hi, Mom.

545
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,588
Oh, hi.

You're treating
your stuffy nose with cocaine.

Diphenhydramine.
Antihistamine.

New delivery system.
It's a blood-brain
barrier thing.

550
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:20,990
It's all about speed,
isn't it? One thing to
another, never standing still.

551
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,437
You're pretty good at that.
I know my way
around a razor blade.

552
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,938
It's time.

553
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,907
Just a couple more rocks.
Andie's going home.

554
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,442
Right.

The parade
of the small bald
circus freaks.

556
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:47,483
Sorry, I've got a thing.
I read her surgeon's report.

557
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,958
Oh?
The clot was nowhere near
her amygdala.

558
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:55,294
Means her fear emotions
were working perfectly.

559
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,433
Yeah.
Yeah.

560
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,498
So her bravery
was not a symptom.

561
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,704
Yeah. I was wrong.

562
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,015
She genuinely is
a self-sacrificing saint,

563
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,612
whose Iife will bring her
nothing but pain.

564
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,121
Which she will
stoically withstand

565
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,219
just so that her mom
doesn't have to cry
quite so soon.

more than you do.
Right.

She stole that kiss
from Chase.
What have you done Iately?

571
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,302
I'm pacing myself.
Unlike her, I have
the Iuxury of time.

572
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,345
She could outlive you.

00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,635
In case you wanna see
real butterflies.

574
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,667
I'm not gonna kiss you.
No matter what you say.

You should go for a walk.

in the park.
