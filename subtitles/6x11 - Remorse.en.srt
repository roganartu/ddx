1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,150
How am I supposed to walk
into that meeting with no presentation?

2
00:00:04,275 --> 00:00:06,634
- How the hell did you screw this up?
- It wasn't me.

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,981
- She's lying.
- No, we agreed.

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,049
- Her team had all the financials.
- We were swamped modeling them.

5
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:14,404
That's why we agreed
that you would do the slides.

6
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,204
One of you screwed up,
so please try to figure it out.

7
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,959
'Cause when the client dumps me,
I need to know who to fire.

8
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:22,105
I confirmed it in an email.
Hold on.

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:23,769
Here.

10
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:29,362
She did tell you, Russ.

11
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,561
What the hell?
I never got this.

12
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:40,206
Russ, are you okay?

13
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:43,723
Are you drunk?

14
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:44,961
I'm not drunk.

15
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,852
I'm not drunk.

16
00:00:57,589 --> 00:00:59,889
I had no idea he was drinking again.

17
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:01,765
You should have.

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,528
Give me 5 minutes.
I'll go to the business center

19
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:05,842
and print the graphs.

20
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:06,857
Run.

21
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:08,859
And bring me some paper towels.

22
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:13,763
What?

23
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:16,786
It hurts.

24
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,333
Don't tell me you were drinking too.

25
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:21,289
My ears.

26
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:22,457
My God.

27
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:58,758
27 year old female

28
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:01,633
intense, intermittent ear pains
saw six doctors.

29
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:03,665
Tell her to stop lurking
in the front row.

30
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,417
If she wants to hit on musicians
that's what four buses are for.

31
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:07,946
Next.

32
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:11,631
If I ask why we're in Wilson's office
is there any chance I'll get a answer?

33
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:13,049
Try it.

34
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:17,355
14 year old boy
joint pain and excess hair growth.

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,388
Tell him to masturbate,
no more than 3 times daily.

36
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,326
With meals.
Next.

37
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:26,187
Did I mention that the 27 year
old female is really hot.

38
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,883
And her husband is really not...

39
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,578
Wild guess.
He's rich.

40
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:34,352
Not unless social workers have begun
pulling in the big money recently.

41
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:37,517
Gimme...

42
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,443
You're taking it because she's hot?

43
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:41,494
No, that would be
an accident of genetics.

44
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:44,142
It's because she's hot
and her husband is ugly.

45
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:47,083
It's a fascinating window
into the mysteries of human psychology.

46
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,051
Also, she's really hot.

47
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:51,546
Or she, you know, loves her husband.

48
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,840
- She loves something about him.
- Vitamin deficiency?

49
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,851
- She changed her diet a few months ago.
- To a healthier diet.

50
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,617
Raw foods, lots of nuts.

51
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,672
It's not the ear,

52
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:02,056
it's the heart.

53
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:05,124
Her protein is cheese,
which can raise cholesterol.

54
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:08,324
Hers was already elevated.
Gave her arterial blockages.

55
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,316
Cardiac arrhythmia presenting
as ear pain. Very rare.

56
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:13,062
Cool.

57
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,787
Beauty and the beast.
Who wants to go see?

58
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:37,008
Let's see... Dr. Taub, Foreman,

59
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,052
Chase, and Hadley.

60
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:41,846
- Four for four.
- I can't believe I get these doctors.

61
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:44,190
And such good-looking ones too.

62
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:46,338
It's almost like
we don't all need to be here.

63
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:49,907
Your case presented a very interesting
diagnostic challenge.

64
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:02,367
You can't sleep in your own office?
Or bedroom for that matter?

65
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,190
Got to avoid my natural habitat.

66
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:08,862
Some idiot I went to med school with

67
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,321
keeps leaving messages
and wants to drop by for lunch.

68
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:12,335
Tell him no.

69
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,963
- It's complicated.
- It's too complicated for you

70
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,173
to tell someone
you don't like to screw off?

71
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:20,176
That's practically your hobby.

72
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:22,931
A few months ago he was...

73
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,363
sort of part of my therapy.

74
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:27,516
My shrink told me

75
00:04:27,803 --> 00:04:30,686
to write a letter of apology
to someone I hurt.

76
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:32,911
And how did you hurt him?

77
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:35,161
We were in a seminar
on flatworm genetics.

78
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:37,161
I switched my final paper with his.

79
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:39,224
You plagiarized?
Doesn't sound like you.

80
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:40,738
I was testing a theory.

81
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,476
I thought that our professor
was biased against me.

82
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,598
I assumed he'd get a high grade
with my paper

83
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:47,482
and I'd get a low grade with his.

84
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,215
Interestingly, I was wrong.

85
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,126
- I got an "A".
- So you're in this mental hospital,

86
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,852
delving into your subconscious,

87
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:57,420
and this is who you choose
to apologize to?

88
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,040
- Lorenzo Wibberly.
- Of all the people you've hurt?

89
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:04,163
Not everyone has a name that's so easy
to find in the white pages.

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,355
I'm in there, and so is Cuddy.

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,356
- And yet, I picked him. It's funny.
- It's hilarious.

92
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:13,688
Great to see
what a success your therapy was.

93
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,015
We said
we'd never go to sleep angry.

94
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,797
We did find an arrhythmia.
It's not from your arteries.

95
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:22,697
- They're clean.
- Will the pain come back?

96
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:25,040
We'll start her on cardiac meds.
That should help.

97
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,813
But we still need to figure out
what's causing the arrhytxmia.

98
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:29,088
Hey, Valerie.

99
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:34,954
It's so nice of you to stop by.

100
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:38,254
- I got lots of free time now.
- You don't blame me, do you?

101
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:41,039
You were drunk in front of Norris.

102
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:44,822
I'm drunk now.

103
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:48,581
It was like someone

104
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,061
poisoned me or something.

105
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,687
Maybe you should come back later.

106
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,527
I wanna say good-bye.

107
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,615
Thank you for coming by.

108
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:10,495
What are you doing?

109
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:15,374
You poor son of a bitch. She doesn't
love you any more than she loved me.

110
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,306
You need to leave right now.

111
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:19,554
You're pretending
you had an affair with my wife?

112
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,840
Yeah, we're all pretending.
You got nothing to worry about.

113
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,347
Tell him where you were
six months ago, Russ.

114
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:28,012
I had a breakdown.

115
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:30,097
I had some paranoid tendencies,

116
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,365
as they say.

117
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:32,683
But it turns out,

118
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,228
I had a right... to be paranoid.

119
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:36,437
You need help.

120
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,650
Get him out of here.

121
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,666
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

122
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:59,502
We'll keep an eye out.
He's not getting back here.

123
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:03,587
He's making all that up.
You know that, right?

124
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:05,007
Yeah, of course.

125
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,482
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Undisclosed location.

126
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,852
- <i>Who are you hiding from?</i>
- Wilson.

127
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,998
<i>And the lunch date
that Wilson is, no doubt,</i>

128
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:20,796
<i>right now trying to sic on me.</i>

129
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:23,860
<i>But in the great game of chess
that is our relationship,</i>

130
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,083
Wilson sees only one move ahead.

131
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:27,779
I see dozens.

132
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,991
<i>That is why he will never mate me.</i>

133
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,134
That's a chess term.

134
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,409
<i>That's great.</i>

135
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,707
<i>A co-worker confronted our patient.
Altered mental status.</i>

136
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,625
<i>Basically accused her
of poisoning him.</i>

137
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,364
- We think he was projecting.
- <i>So he's poisoning her.</i>

138
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:45,673
What could he get his hands on
to cause supraventricular tachycardia?

139
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,216
Does he have dry skin?

140
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,593
<i>Thin eyebrows?</i>

141
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,842
If you're sharing an amazed look,

142
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,764
- please do it louder.
- <i>He might have.</i>

143
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:57,315
- How did you know that?
- <i>If he has hypothyroidism</i>

144
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,479
<i>and he dumped his meds in her coffee,
That would make her heart go boom.</i>

145
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,773
- In a bad way.
- <i>We'll treat with beta blockers.</i>

146
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,358
Sorry, but I disagree.

147
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,485
<i>- With what?
- With everything.</i>

148
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,880
Why are we assuming he's lying
and she's telling the truth?

149
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:11,440
Because she's a successful,
happily married consultant,

150
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:14,201
and he's a crazy, drunk weirdo
who we tossed out of the hospital.

151
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,079
- And she's hot.
- <i>She picked him 'cause he's vulnerable.</i>

152
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,248
There's something off about her,
I can feel it.

153
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:20,869
If you had any evidence...

154
00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:24,003
Why didn't she tell us he puked
on her shoes right before she collapsed?

155
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:26,763
It's medically irrelevant.
He was drunk, she was sick.

156
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:29,794
<i> You don't think it's suspicious
she didn't mention it to her husband?</i>

157
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,334
<i>Why did you break up with thirteen?</i>

158
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,223
The non-subtextual thing
she was saying, why that?

159
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:37,643
This is about the case,

160
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,567
not some imaginary issue
that you think Foreman and I have.

161
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,826
Great, start her on beta blockers.

162
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:50,232
You'll do it?

163
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:53,741
- I don't think he was talking to me.
- Well, I am.

164
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:56,494
I'm the only one
who thinks you're wrong.

165
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:58,412
Maybe that's why
I'm asking you to do it.

166
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:20,476
Lorenzo Wibberly.

167
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,122
Dr. Wilson said you'd be here.

168
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,531
How ya been?

169
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:28,127
Check and mate.

170
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,424
I'm sorry this is awkward
or whatever.

171
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,164
I thought it was nice of you
to write that letter,

172
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,012
and I wanted to tell you
that you don't have to feel bad.

173
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,041
So where are you working these days?

174
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,552
You got your own practice
or you at a hospital?

175
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,971
I thought you knew.

176
00:09:57,835 --> 00:10:00,022
Dani's,
the organic supermarket chain.

177
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:01,747
As an in house doctor?

178
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,653
I actually never got licensed.

179
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,897
I didn't graduate med school.

180
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,390
I planned on going back,

181
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:11,736
and my father got sick
and I had to take care of him

182
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,280
and had some bad luck.

183
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,189
Why didn't you graduate?

184
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,159
I was one credit short.

185
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,725
And I was sort of already
on academic probation.

186
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,372
Which credit?

187
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:25,465
I got a...

188
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:30,537
He failed me
on that paper you switched.

189
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,849
I thought you knew.

190
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:36,844
So I'm guessing you're the CEO
of this supermarket chain?

191
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:39,331
I bag groceries.

192
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,657
Life works out weird sometimes.

193
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:51,650
We were gonna do it in Santa Barbara
because of his parents.

194
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,235
<i>But then I found this beautiful
hotel in Montauk and...</i>

195
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:58,103
- You're testing her for a brain tumor?
- That's what I told her.

196
00:10:58,228 --> 00:11:00,201
You can chastise me
after you look at the monitor.

197
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,329
- Look what's lighting up.
- Lateral frontal cortex.

198
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,790
- Broca's area... So what?
- I told her it was customary

199
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,708
to talk during MRIs, to relax.

200
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:10,535
I spent the last 30 minutes
asking her about everything in life

201
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,879
that she loves, then hates,

202
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,257
then feels any emotion about at all.

203
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,676
There's nothing in the
paralimbic system, amygdala.

204
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,720
She's using the language part
and bypassing the emotional.

205
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,543
She can understand love
and pain and empathy,

206
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:25,267
But she can't feel them at all.

207
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,740
She's a psychopath.

208
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:39,889
- Why do you want to meet her so badly?
- Psychopaths always fascinate me.

209
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:43,664
I think it's their cultural literacy
and strong family values.

210
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:46,116
- Or is that Jews?
- We're not gonna be able

211
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:48,958
to get an honest read on her
unless her husband is out of there.

212
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,044
I got an idea.

213
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:53,747
Can you get out of here?

214
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:55,707
Thanks.

215
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,805
It was the "thanks" that did it.

216
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,628
I'm Dr. House.

217
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:08,852
How long have you been a psychopath?

218
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:13,084
- Are you kidding?
- He's not.

219
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:15,648
Are you saying
I'm like Ted Bundy or something?

220
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:19,572
Psychopathy can get a bad rap.
It doesn't mean you're violent.

221
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:22,618
Just that you're without conscience,
You lack any normal emotion,

222
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,035
you manipulate everyone,

223
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,621
you're promiscuous,
you lie pathologically.

224
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:28,998
Any of this ringing bells?

225
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:31,831
Is that why you were asking me
those weird questions?

226
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:33,878
Though you have Darwin
to thank for that.

227
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:35,872
She got the creeps around you.

228
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:38,964
Which oddly, is an actual medical
phenomenon around psychopaths.

229
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:41,095
Probably an evolved response
to predators.

230
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,806
I'm sorry,
you're really freaking me out.

231
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,043
- I have no idea what...
- Relax.

232
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:48,255
We have a duty of confidentiality.

233
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,770
You have an undiagnosed heart problem
that could kill you at any moment.

234
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,845
We believe that your mental abnormality
is related to your physical one.

235
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,370
So if you want
to keep on predating...

236
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:08,585
What do you want to know?

237
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:18,756
Your co-worker's story was true.

238
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,274
You poisoned him.

239
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:23,888
I gave him a little Valium
and an emetic.

240
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:26,714
You understand
what the word "no" means?

241
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,309
- I've had them before.
- So you were helping him out?

242
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:33,376
And I assume he was cool
with the seducing and firing part too?

243
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:35,607
Russ knew what he was getting into.

244
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,413
He got sex every Thursday night,

245
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:39,611
and I got to take credit
for his best ideas.

246
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,114
- What do you get out of your marriage?
- Same thing you get out of your job.

247
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,018
Bill has a trust fund.

248
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:48,218
And I have a prenup
his parents made me sign.

249
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:49,829
Told you he was rich.

250
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:51,554
She's not that weird.

251
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,458
I'm not so different than anybody else.

252
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:57,630
Everyone I've ever known, my family,
my classmates, the people I work with.

253
00:13:58,297 --> 00:13:59,669
They're out for themselves.

254
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:01,676
But I could admit it to myself.

255
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:04,510
- She reminds me of someone I know.
- Tell me about it.

256
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:07,555
Some of my co-workers will insult people
right to their faces.

257
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,849
How long have you been this way?

258
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:13,686
Just how I am.

259
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:17,842
Are you gonna cure
my heart problems now?

260
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,038
So psychopathy plus cardiac arrhythmia.
Go!

261
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:26,662
I thought you were bluffing.
You really think they're connected?

262
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:30,063
Two rare conditions in one patient,
it's a fair assumption they are.

263
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:33,269
Psychopathy is generally genetic,
nothing you can do.

264
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:36,161
Something that hits 30 years after birth
isn't gonna be connected.

265
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:38,274
Her disease isn't gonna lie dormant
that long.

266
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,377
- Did her heart warp her brain?
- Maybe a handful of diseases.

267
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:43,655
It'll be super awesome
when we find it.

268
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,344
Tertiary syphilis can cause
pseudopsychopathic syndrome

269
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,442
- and cardiomyopathy.
- Fits best. Start her on penicillin,

270
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,391
And rule out Wilson's
and Hashimoto's.

271
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,089
There's your handful.

272
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:54,864
Wasn't so hard, was it?

273
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:04,654
Do something about thirteen.

274
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,496
She flouted both
my authority and yours.

275
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:10,162
Yes, and she got it right
and you got it wrong.

276
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:11,786
Which aggravates the problem.

277
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,706
She'll do it again.
Next time it won't work out so well.

278
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:18,254
You gotta punish her.

279
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,966
You're her boss.

280
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:23,019
In some vague,
never to be usefully defined way.

281
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:25,383
- You punish her.
- I'm also her ex,

282
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,990
Which makes it a little complicated.

283
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:32,015
The fact that you also fired her
takes it from complicated to moronic.

284
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:35,084
- It was the only way...
- It wasn't because you loved her.

285
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,894
It was because you loved your career.

286
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:39,068
We're almost at my floor
so I'll summarize.

287
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:40,843
Your problem, not mine.

288
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:50,984
- You cut up my only copy of that photo.
- That rare daguerreotype.

289
00:15:51,355 --> 00:15:54,483
Charge me for the effort it takes
to search your HD for a new copy.

290
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,508
Not the one of me and Lucas.

291
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,357
The one from Ecuador.

292
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,654
I'd forgotten your attachment
to lemurs.

293
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:02,779
To my dad.

294
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,883
- You got his tail.
- He was holding the camera.

295
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:09,851
That was the last trip
we ever took together.

296
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:12,238
And I don't have a digital copy.

297
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,479
Well, I could stand here all day
apologizing,

298
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:21,230
but I'd rather expiate
my sins with good clean work.

299
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,459
You ignoring my texts?

300
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:29,168
The ones you sent
trying to get me to make you feel better

301
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:31,032
about destroying your classmate's life?

302
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
No, I never got those.

303
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,285
Who's this?

304
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,891
He is a doctor of medical.&

305
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:41,147
Also of medicine.

306
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,989
Dr. Wilson called me in
on a consult.

307
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,255
Wibberly's got some agenda.

308
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,570
To guilt me
into getting him a better job.

309
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:50,802
- How pissed was he?
- Not at all.

310
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,321
Hence the agenda.

311
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:55,908
It hurts a lot.

312
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:59,032
Then you shouldn't have hit it.

313
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,913
Very dangerous working conditions.

314
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:03,940
Do something to help.

315
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:06,004
You are responsible.

316
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:10,154
Don't worry.

317
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,872
Dr. Wilson is a very good physician.

318
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,329
Who has enormous empathy
towards patients

319
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,106
which stems from his crippling battle
with sexual dysfunction.

320
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:26,712
I'm responsible for the foreseeable
consequences of switching papers.

321
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,823
A bad grade or a sleepless night.

322
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,498
Worst case, a retest.

323
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,932
There was no way to know
that one seminar paper

324
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:34,884
was gonna destroy this idiot's life.

325
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:38,432
If there's any karma in all this,
he's probably happier than you are.

326
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:41,554
Good point.

327
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,063
If he's happier,
there's no harm done.

328
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,581
I'll go find out.

329
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,485
- That is absolutely not what I said.
- Always with the modesty, this one.

330
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:54,115
Next time you want to get
secretly stoned at work

331
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,617
and mistake your thumb for a nail?

332
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,787
Eye drops are a good call,

333
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,055
but useless,

334
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:05,369
that's why
you're tearing up so much.

335
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:10,774
He says you are a very good doctor.

336
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:20,886
You want something to eat?

337
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:22,326
I'm cool.

338
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:25,749
How's work?

339
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,526
You happy with it?

340
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:31,474
You know... It's a job.

341
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,861
I don't need to take any work home
with me at least.

342
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:37,086
Free time...

343
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,334
Wouldn't have any
if you were a doctor.

344
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,289
True.

345
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:46,155
You like chili? I could reheat some.

346
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,680
Is that your yard?

347
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:49,878
That's nice.

348
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:55,801
That sugar maple,
100, 150 years old.

349
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,917
Most beautiful leaves in the fall.

350
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:01,098
Sitting underneath on the bench...

351
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:03,775
It's like paradise.

352
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:06,226
I don't have a yard, myself.

353
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,097
You got a good thing going.

354
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:11,635
I know.

355
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:13,724
So what are the boxes for?

356
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:17,668
I'm moving.

357
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,725
From paradise?

358
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,567
Well, my dad's medical bills

359
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,228
and me having
an adjustable mortgage.

360
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,208
You're losing your home?

361
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:30,086
It could be worse, right?

362
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:33,675
How?

363
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:37,266
Even if the tests are positive,
you don't have to worry.

364
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:39,795
You're testing for syphilis,
not a cold.

365
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:43,975
- At this stage, it's not communicable.
- You think I'm worried about myself?

366
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:46,891
- I want her to get better.
- She might have caught it at birth.

367
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:50,523
So it doesn't prove she was cheating,
if you were worried about that.

368
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,319
- Of course not.
- How many weeks am I gonna have to...

369
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:55,435
You okay? Why is she coughing?

370
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,321
- I don't know.
- Want some water?

371
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:02,715
Are you threatened by me?

372
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,292
- Not at all.
- Well, you should be.

373
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,511
You let him know what I told you,
I will have your license pulled,

374
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:15,047
and I will sue you
for everything I lose in the divorce.

375
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,925
So the fun you get
out of making those snotty comments,

376
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,793
is it worth $19 million?

377
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,179
Wait, will you hold that look?

378
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,486
I'm really bad at showing emotions.

379
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:25,661
How's this?

380
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:29,699
Thanks, baby.

381
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:32,315
Can I have your arm please?

382
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:41,727
My arm! You broke it!

383
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:45,984


384
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:51,126
- I don't know what happened.
- Me neither.

385
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,255
But after that, she called Cuddy
and demanded you off the case.

386
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:58,717
I backed you up,
because I trust you.

387
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,730
But you're gonna have to earn
that trust now.

388
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:04,055
Actually, he backed you up

389
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,391
Because of the new
BUN creatinine numbers.

390
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,252
Brittle bones
were from kidney failure.

391
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:10,406
There is that.

392
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:13,148
- So heart and kidneys.
- And brain.

393
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:15,817
- Psychopathy is not a symptom.
- It was yesterday.

394
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,300
In the meantime,
kidney failure ruled out syphilis

395
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,238
and testing
ruled out the other ideas.

396
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,240
Protein levels, kidneys, arrhythmia.

397
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:25,058
Could be paraneoplastic.
I'd say lymphoma.

398
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,661
Get her to radiotherapy.

399
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:29,581
We can't start radiation
without immunoassays on her urine.

400
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:32,028
So cast a spell
and magically fix her kidney

401
00:21:32,153 --> 00:21:33,542
so she gives us some urine.

402
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,671
- We have some from admission.
- Not enough for an accurate reading.

403
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,455
How about partially accurate?

404
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,926
Those of you
who haven't slept together, you can go.

405
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,240
Everyone else, stay behind.

406
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:50,835
Sorry.

407
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:52,988
That was our secret, right?

408
00:21:59,203 --> 00:22:01,279
- Go have sex.
- No, thanks.

409
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:04,157
Fine, I'll cover the Viagra
and the lubricants. Get me a receipt.

410
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:06,660
- We have zero feelings for each other.
- Too bad.

411
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:09,204
Because things worked much better
then.

412
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:11,873
- What if I slept with her?
- We were getting to a diagnosis.

413
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,042
We were already at the diagnosis.

414
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,711
You were creating a fake argument
about a treatment issue,

415
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,527
'cause you can't stand each other.

416
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:21,252
So have sex, fight or quit,
I don't care.

417
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:23,677
What you're doing now isn't working.

418
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:34,484
You okay?

419
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:40,485
Look, I get that you gotta act fast.

420
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:43,684
Radiation?
You ruled out everything else?

421
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:45,159
I'm sorry, but...

422
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:50,369
We could still check
for environmental toxins.

423
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,796
Where does she spend
most of her time?

424
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,292
- Mostly at work, at home.
- Hobbies?

425
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,420
- Recurring activities outside the home?
- Not really.

426
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:00,714
She took a landscaping class.

427
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,882
- At the Y.
- When did it meet?

428
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:05,726
Every Thursday night this summer.

429
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,437
You dig in soil,

430
00:23:08,562 --> 00:23:12,462
You can be exposed to pesticides,
heavy metals, lots of bad things.

431
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:14,659
Can you find out
all about her landscaping class,

432
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,884
where it was, details like that?

433
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:18,572
I'll do it now.

434
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:28,658
So when you watch <i>Star Wars</i>,

435
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:31,077
which side do you root for?

436
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:36,752
What are you doing?

437
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:39,327
Just checking in
on your radiotherapy.

438
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:43,018
From what I hear,
you never visit patients.

439
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:46,392
And now,
you've come to chat with me twice.

440
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,644
I want to know how you like
being a management consultant.

441
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,537
I'm thinking of getting into it.

442
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:53,512
That or psychopathy, maybe.

443
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:55,364
Which pays better?

444
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,438
I think you're already
into one of them.

445
00:23:58,997 --> 00:24:00,875
Dr. Hadley made a joke yesterday.

446
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,800
She said I sound like you.

447
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,922
I'm sure you understand
what joke means.

448
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:08,990
So you're not just out for yourself?

449
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,640
For example, you would never interrupt
a sick woman's treatment

450
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:15,315
just because of some
personal obsession?

451
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:18,290
Of course I'm self-interested.

452
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,515
We all are. We're born that way.

453
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:23,962
The rest of us
are born with consciences.

454
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,087
Which is something
you just sound ecstatic about.

455
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,096
I'm not saying it's logical,
it's human.

456
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:34,284
So if you know your conscience

457
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:37,727
is just an animal instinct,
you don't need to follow it.

458
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,570
I think you realize that.

459
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,871
That's why you're talking to me.

460
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,088
You lied
about your landscaping class.

461
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:08,675
Dr. Hadley thought the soils
might be poisoned.

462
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:11,819
- You told him that?
- I just thought...

463
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,638
Russ said you were having an affair.

464
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,079
Was that your cover?
Every Thursday night you'd...

465
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,770
I'm so sorry.

466
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,687
It's not what you think.

467
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:29,014
Do you remember that telecom case
I said that we didn't get last year?

468
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:31,389
In fact, we did, and I was swamped.

469
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,227
Every Friday morning
we had a conference call with London,

470
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:35,564
so the night before...

471
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:38,788
That's your excuse? You expect me
to believe that you were at the office?

472
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:41,082
What's the biggest argument
we've ever had?

473
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,710
You said I spend too much time
away from home.

474
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:46,521
That I don't need a job,
that you would take care of me.

475
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:49,767
- That's all true.
- You yelled at me.

476
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,980
You made me feel like

477
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,970
you didn't value anything
that I did.

478
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:55,331
I need this job

479
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,556
to feel like I'm accomplishing something
on my own.

480
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:00,675
That's why I lied.

481
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,965
If I call your office tomorrow
and I check...

482
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,814
Call my office, call my secretary,

483
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:06,282
Call my clients.

484
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:10,278
Interrupt their dinner, wake them up.
I just want you to know the truth.

485
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,031
You know I love you.

486
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:17,911
Come here.

487
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:20,233
Please.

488
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,589
It's okay.

489
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:41,309
Fire her.

490
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:44,054
What for? You seemed to have lied
your way out of any trouble.

491
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,729
'Til Bill checks up on my cover.

492
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,897
I've to create a new one
to cover that one up.

493
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,651
I've done it before but it's a pain.

494
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:52,279
And I would like Dr. Hadley
to share that pain.

495
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:54,837
She didn't reveal confidences,
she had a medical reason

496
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:56,491
to ask about your landscaping class.

497
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:58,486
We can see what a jury
says about that.

498
00:26:58,611 --> 00:27:01,698
And admit to your husband the truth?
You're not gonna sue us.

499
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:04,792
We will remove Dr. Hadley
from all patient contact.

500
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:05,648
What?

501
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:09,046
But it's for Dr. Hadley's benefit,
not yours.

502
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:12,137
We have no obligation
to inflict you on her.

503
00:27:12,842 --> 00:27:13,675
Fine.

504
00:27:14,777 --> 00:27:17,389
But just so you know,
this is not for your benefit.

505
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:20,443
Dr. Cuddy's furious at you
put her hospital at risk.

506
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,644
She just knows it's a bad idea
to admit it in front of me.

507
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:26,422
Think what you want.

508
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:28,416
By the way, your orderly's outside.

509
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:32,337
I'd wait about another 10 minutes
if you want your husband

510
00:27:32,462 --> 00:27:34,463
to think you're having
radiation treatments.

511
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:41,620
Are you by chance gonna cry?

512
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:45,206
'Cause that's one I just can't do.

513
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:04,859
Hello?

514
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:06,952
This is dr. Hadley.

515
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:11,817
What?

516
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,951
- You called the medical board?
- What is she talking about?

517
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:22,077
Accusations of sexual harassment.
You don't think I know it's you?

518
00:28:22,245 --> 00:28:22,994
Come on.

519
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:26,748
You already got me fired from the case.
What else do you want?

520
00:28:27,884 --> 00:28:29,234
Get out here now.

521
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:41,680
- You're an idiot.
- She wants to make me lose my license.

522
00:28:41,848 --> 00:28:44,789
She'll fail, unless you're stupid enough
to go in there and scream at her.

523
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:47,060
Sexual harassment accusations
are serious.

524
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:49,354
If she made them anonymously,
the case goes away.

525
00:28:49,522 --> 00:28:52,626
If she used her name,
we all back you up, It goes away.

526
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:54,306
You're completely overreacting.

527
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:56,488
You'd be pissed off too
if you were me.

528
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:59,324
Or maybe not. You're just about
as emotional as she is.

529
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:02,451
- I'm doing you a favor.
- When you try to do something nice,

530
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:03,961
You sound like a jerk.

531
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
I'm sorry.

532
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
For what?

533
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:13,128
For firing you.

534
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,974
Don't do that,
that's not what this is about.

535
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:17,841
I'll apologize anyway.

536
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:20,126
I did it for me. Not for you.

537
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,512
I realized that
right after I fired you.

538
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:27,060
But I couldn't admit it.

539
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:30,812
Screwed everything up.

540
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:33,600
I hope that we can still work
together.

541
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:41,304
Something's wrong.

542
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,701
Blood flow is backing up,
spilling into her esophagus.

543
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:45,410
- The cancer?
- This isn't lymphoma.

544
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:48,006
We don't know what it is.
We can wrap bands around the veins,

545
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:51,206
But , that might not work.
I want to try something called a "tips,"

546
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,544
a shunt that makes
the blood bypass the liver.

547
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,045
That'll save her?

548
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:57,949
It should preserve her liver
and heart. The liver cleans out toxins,

549
00:29:58,074 --> 00:30:00,634
Bypass it too long, she'll get
brain damage, eventually die.

550
00:30:00,802 --> 00:30:03,512
That's still probably less dangerous
than bleeding out now.

551
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:09,267
- She usually makes the decisions.
- You gotta step up now.

552
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:14,564
- Was she cheating on me?
- I can't discuss...

553
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,234
Just tell me she wasn't lying.

554
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:18,009
Just tell me that.

555
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:25,485
I'm supposed to make this decision?

556
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:28,362
I don't even know
who she is anymore.

557
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:30,557
Either way,
you gotta do it right now.

558
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:35,703
Do whatever you think is right.

559
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,955
I'd give her a day.
Two days at the most.

560
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:52,936
Great. You be the clock.

561
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:56,586
Everyone else will be the doctors.
Heart, kidneys, now liver.

562
00:30:56,774 --> 00:30:58,483
- Amyloidosis?
- No speckles on the MRI.

563
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:01,111
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?
- Too much kidney failure.

564
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:03,267
Primary hepatic fibrosis?

565
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:08,319
That's our best guess.
Start her on steroids.

566
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:10,620
Even if we're right,
the liver's probably too scarred.

567
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:13,421
- We've got to list her for a new one.
- With an unconfirmed diagnosis?

568
00:31:13,546 --> 00:31:14,961
- Not gonna happen.
- A family?

569
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:17,508
I don't think the husband is
the right blood type. Even if he was,

570
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:20,076
- He's not gonna give his liver.
- He left her, I assume?

571
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,201
Not yet.

572
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:24,304
Says he won't abandon her
while she's sick.

573
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:26,316
She have any other family members?

574
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:28,805
No one's gonna risk their life
to save hers.

575
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:32,924
One false accusation from a psychopath,
and you turned out to be a real bummer.

576
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:35,903
I'm gonna go see if
Wilson has the liver left.

577
00:31:48,945 --> 00:31:50,147
What are you doing?

578
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,104
Paying Wibberly's mortgage
for a few months.

579
00:31:53,903 --> 00:31:56,765
Congratulations on another
successful round of hectoring.

580
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,582
Wait a minute, is that
actually a check for him?

581
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,219
It's a giant novelty item
for winning the lottery.

582
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:05,261
You're just
standing really far away.

583
00:32:05,578 --> 00:32:08,389
Of all the people
to go the extra mile for,

584
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:10,226
- why this guy?
- I don't know.

585
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:12,972
He just kinda smells
good and makes me laugh.

586
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,252
Why not Cuddy? You never apologized
after you defaced her photo.

587
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:19,058
Maybe because I recognize
that sending someone to the poor house

588
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:21,603
is a little more serious
than editing a snapshot.

589
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:24,374
No, it's because Cuddy actually
means something to you,

590
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:26,572
Which makes it
much harder to apologize.

591
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:31,662
If it will make you shut up,
I'll tell her I'm sorry about the photo.

592
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:33,954
Forget the photo.
She was in love with you.

593
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:36,318
And all she got in return was abuse.

594
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:38,745
For years,
you toyed with her emotions.

595
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,044
- She wasn't in love with me.
- You still can't admit it.

596
00:32:41,212 --> 00:32:42,826
That proves my point.

597
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,605
What do you want?

598
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:48,031
- Helping the guy was your idea.
- No, help the guy, whatever...

599
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:50,929
I'm just pointing out
that it's much easier

600
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,878
to soothe your guilt
by throwing money at a stranger

601
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:57,269
than by making amends
to a person you actually cared about.

602
00:32:57,703 --> 00:32:59,271
You had me at "much easier."

603
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:02,549
I'm gonna pretend to go to work now.

604
00:33:32,408 --> 00:33:34,525
I'm Dr. Hadley.
I'm sorry to bother you,

605
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,061
But I was told
you're Valerie's sister?

606
00:33:37,403 --> 00:33:40,082
I was just surprised
you came to visit.

607
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:43,909
So is the rest of my family.

608
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:46,776
I was even more surprised
you got tested as a donor.

609
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:49,097
- Wrong blood type.
- But why?

610
00:33:49,572 --> 00:33:51,531
I mean, you know what she's like.

611
00:33:52,393 --> 00:33:53,533
She's not that bad.

612
00:33:54,354 --> 00:33:55,454
Yes, she is.

613
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:02,095
Our dad was a mean drunk.

614
00:34:03,313 --> 00:34:04,731
I was the older sister.

615
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:06,588
I was supposed to stand up for her,

616
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:09,135
not the other way around.

617
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:11,605
She protected you
when you were kids?

618
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:13,949
Yeah, and then all of the sudden...

619
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,022
All of his crap

620
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:17,981
and all his abuse...

621
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:20,685
It just changed her.

622
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,739
It made her cold.

623
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:25,815
When?

624
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:32,781
We were wrong.
Psychopathy is a symptom.

625
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,200
I spoke to her sister.
She wasn't always like this.

626
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:38,036
She changed,
and right around adolescence.

627
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,334
So liver, heart, brain,
can lie dormant,

628
00:34:44,611 --> 00:34:46,361
And it starts at puberty.

629
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:56,137
The raw food diet
made it go fulminate...

630
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:58,181
Nuts are high in copper.

631
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,842
It's wilson's disease.

632
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:03,103
We ruled that out.
No keyser-fleischer rings.

633
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:06,982
There is one other sign.

634
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:09,529
I know there are lipstick lesbians.

635
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:12,895
Are there
nail polish remover bisexuals?

636
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:18,161
She's not supposed to be here.

637
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,969
As a doctor. You didn't say anything
about her capacity

638
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:22,539
as a beautician's assistant.

639
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:39,894
Her fingernail's blue?

640
00:35:41,094 --> 00:35:42,744
Start her on chelation.

641
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:46,233
- What just happened?
- You're gonna get better.

642
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:49,536
Your body has an inability
to process copper.

643
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:53,660
It caused all of your problems.
Even what's wrong with your brain.

644
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:55,405
And that's gonna change too?

645
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:59,362
It's probably rewired
her neurons permanently by now.

646
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:00,994
But it's possible?

647
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:03,466
Maybe.

648
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,841
I've to go get the chelation equipment.
Bill, I need you to sign some forms.

649
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:18,136
You don't see what she's doing?

650
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:21,310
She's laying the groundwork
to get her treatment,

651
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:23,391
wake up
a completely different person,

652
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:27,187
So that you and all of your money
stay with her.

653
00:36:28,263 --> 00:36:29,313
It's a lie.

654
00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:31,900
You said there was a chance.

655
00:36:32,562 --> 00:36:34,214
There's a teeny chance.

656
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:37,912
But even if it cures her,
It's not going to make her love you.

657
00:36:41,962 --> 00:36:43,512
I was happy before...

658
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:47,103
I know. And I'm sorry,

659
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:49,446
But it wasn't real.

660
00:36:50,747 --> 00:36:52,165
It felt real.

661
00:36:56,804 --> 00:36:58,054
I don't know...

662
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:02,966
Maybe that can be enough.

663
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,259
You're really doing this for me?

664
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:21,039
Tax shelter.

665
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:25,329
I'll take some of that chili now.

666
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,379
- I can't accept this.
- Fine.

667
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,142
Forget the chili.

668
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,549
Bye, Wibberly.

669
00:37:37,775 --> 00:37:39,668
I got an "A+" with your paper.

670
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,767
I was an orthopedic surgeon
for ten years at New York mercy.

671
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:49,019
I had a gambling problem.

672
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:51,955
I tried to cover it
by over-billing some medicate patients.

673
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,107
Lost my license.

674
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:55,123
That's why I'm here.

675
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:56,685
Not because of you.

676
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,030
Why are you telling me this now?

677
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,854
Because I thought you'd be the same
bastard you were in med school, but...

678
00:38:18,515 --> 00:38:19,449
Keep it.

679
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:21,302
No, I can get another place.

680
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:22,970
Just take it.

681
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:25,514
- I screwed you over.
- You got me an "A+".

682
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:26,905
Take it.

683
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,686
Do I have to shove it down your throat?
Take the damn check!

684
00:38:57,111 --> 00:38:58,547
Your vitals are up.

685
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:04,701
- Treatment's working?
- I'm not sure we can fix your liver,

686
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:07,329
but we can definitely
list you for a new one.

687
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:11,607
When you're better,
We're gonna take a long vacation.

688
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:14,687
You wanna go to vietnam, one of
the beaches, we're gonna get a hut.

689
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:17,285
Just you and me,
nothing to worry about.

690
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,114
You're pathetic.

691
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:27,976
What?

692
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:30,663
I mean, when you had a suspicion,
fine.

693
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:32,623
But you know now.

694
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,939
How can you be this pitiful?

695
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:37,712
You don't mean this.

696
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:40,203
- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.

697
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:43,375
I almost died and I still might.

698
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,428
And who knows, maybe it's
focusing my mind

699
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:48,710
because the idea of spending
the rest of my life with you...

700
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:08,601
Why did you do that?

701
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:10,156
Because he's pathetic.

702
00:40:10,465 --> 00:40:11,965
He hasn't changed...

703
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,753
But you have.

704
00:40:19,593 --> 00:40:22,122
The treatment actually worked
on your brain.

705
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:25,259
If you were still a psychopath,
you would've just kept draining him dry.

706
00:40:25,427 --> 00:40:27,895
- What do you want?
- You're feeling something.

707
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,570
What is it?

708
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:32,048
What do you feel?

709
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:37,719
I don't know.

710
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:41,957
It hurts.

711
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:51,266
It will.

712
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:10,426
Heard about the diagnosis.

713
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:11,430
Nice job.

714
00:41:11,888 --> 00:41:12,888
Thanks.

715
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,067
Why are you here so late?

716
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:16,592
Discharge summary.

717
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:19,671
Taub's handwriting
isn't helping much.

718
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:22,616
Apparently on the third day
of admission, the patient underwent

719
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:24,727
rabbit thumping.

720
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,990
Radiotherapy.

721
00:41:35,302 --> 00:41:38,156
Third day after admission,
patient underwent radiotherapy

722
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:41,756
including...
external beam radiation...

723
00:41:47,857 --> 00:41:49,876
to treat b-cell lymphomas.

724
00:41:50,534 --> 00:41:52,134
First treatment was...

725
00:41:55,522 --> 00:41:57,226
Full mantle therapy...
