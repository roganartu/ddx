<i>Six-year-old</i>
<i>with a nosebleed</i>

and breathing problems.

79
00:05:19,113 --> 00:05:21,031
She was born
with a rare mutation of A-T.

80
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:24,617
Emily has a unique variant

Nosebleeds and breathing

89

90
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,863

<i>the natural progression--</i>
- It's not.

A-T patients have
a life expectancy of 20 years.

93
00:05:57,284 --> 00:06:00,203
Emily is only six.
It's something else.

94
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,238
I examined her lungs
two days ago.

95
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:03,757
They're functioning normally.

96
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:05,191
It says she fell off
a carousel.

97
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:06,159
Head trauma--

98
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,160

00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:10,413
I wouldn't need you people.

100
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:13,416

<i>you're the best.</i>

00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,002
<i>We are.</i>

103
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,805

Wegener's granulomatosis?

104
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:24,544
It's a good fit.

105
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:26,062
But she can't have X-rays.

106
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:28,598
<i>A-T makes her hypersensitive</i>
<i>to ionizing radiation.</i>

107
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:30,767
I'll get her prepped
for an MRI.

108
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:36,889
She knows more about
her daughter's genetic condition

109
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:38,358
than any of you.

110
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,577
She'll be an asset.

111
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:41,727
<i>Or she won't,</i>

112
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44,581
Eric.

113
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:45,615
This isn't a request.

114
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,133
Use her.

115
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:54,240
The tumor's spread
to the surrounding tissue.

116
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:55,875
We're gonna have
to shrink it

117
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:56,843
before we remove it
surgically.

118
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,428
I'm more interested

119
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:01,381
in exactly how you plan
to do that, Mike.

120
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:02,882
We start conservative.

121
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:05,051
Daily radiation treatments
for three weeks.

122
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:06,936
And, if it doesn't shrink enough
after that,

123
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:08,822
we'll add the chemo--

124
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,658
And, if it hasn't shrunk enough
after that, I'm dead.

125
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,931
Look, you have
over a 75% chance

126
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:19,499
that the radiation alone
is enough.

127
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:20,483
Relax.

128
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:21,784
Caught this in time.

129
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:23,169
Catching it in time
would have been

130
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:25,972
before it invaded the tissue
around my thymus.

131
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,074
I want the radiation
and the chemo concurrently.

132
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:31,628
Why stress your immune system
unnecessarily?

133
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,279
Let's just go
with my plan, okay?

134
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,165
The radiation first--
I'm gonna get a second opinion.

135
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,000
Are you serious?

136
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:39,552
Look, I've seen you recommend
this exact treatment

137
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,454
dozens of times.
We're done here.

138
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:43,256
I'll look for a doctor
with some actual balls.

139
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:50,263
Hey, you need
to talk to your friend.

140
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:51,814
<i>He's embarrassing himself.</i>

141
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,033

to handle his own illness

142
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:55,068
<i>with a little bit</i>
<i>more dignity.</i>

143
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,769

144
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,354
My recommended treatment
is sound.

145
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,822
No, I meant
about the ball-less part.

146
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:01,641
Explains the office.

147
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:06,646
<i>It was a merry-go-round.</i>

148
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,198
She's a kid, Liz.
We were having fun.

149
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:09,415
You should try it sometime.

150
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:11,534
Fun?
She's six, not you.

151
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:13,119
You know
she has balance issues.

152
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,339
I know that she's--

153
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:19,709
This is Emily's father,
Simon.

154
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:21,628
He was with her
when the symptoms occurred.

155
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,930
I had her all week.
She was fine.

156
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,515

157
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,167
No need.
Patient's ready for transport.

158
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:32,338

<i>in the gift shop.</i>

162
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:47,487
They're gonna take you
for an MRI now.

163
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:51,374
It means
"magic really cool images."

164
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:55,561
I thought it stood for
"magnetic resonance imaging."

165
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,915
We've spent a lot
of time in hospitals.

166
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,120
B-9.

167
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:10,059
- Hit.
And I hate you.

168
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:16,282
Ugh.

169
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,883

170
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:20,553
No.
But I think I'm gonna puke.

171
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:23,156
Good. Now that you're
sufficiently buzzed,

172
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:26,225
what was the reason behind you
freaking out on Kondo?

173
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:28,027
Are you scared?

174
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:29,545
Are you in denial?

175
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:30,947
I know you get confused

176
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:33,399
any time someone thinks
that you're wrong,

177
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,900
but it's not considered
freaking out

178
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:36,753
for a patient to ask
for a second opinion.

179
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,338
Okay, well,
here it is.

180
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,123
Kondo is right.

181
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:41,624
You should be
in radiology right now.

182
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:42,925
Well done.

183
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,211
You've kept your word
for almost two hours.

184
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:46,596
Every day you wait,

185
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,582
our pal toomie
is growing larger in your chest.

186
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,100
If you want to live,

187
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:52,852
stop screwing around
and do something about it.

188
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,521
Good idea.

189
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:56,639
I think

190
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:59,759
I'll start
with spending spring break

191
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:02,729
on my own.

192
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,152
How you feeling
in there, Emily?

193
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:10,336
<i>Good, I guess.</i>

194
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:13,906
Is something wrong?

195
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:18,111
I was only pretending
to be asleep.

196
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,313
<i>You think</i>
<i>that's dishonest?</i>

197
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:23,682
Uh, that's--

198
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,184
My daughters do that too.

199
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:27,403
But they know that sometimes,
when it seems

200
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:29,288
like mommy and daddy
are fighting, it's really

201
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:31,491
only because they're worried
about you.

202
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:37,063
And does your wife
ever want a divorce?

203
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,700
No.
Everything's fine at home.

204
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:44,137
Hold still now.
No more talking.

205
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:49,708
What do you think
of her mother?

206
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,879
She called her daughter
"the patient".

207
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:58,985
If my kids were born
with an expiration date,

208
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:01,938
- I don't--
- <i>Ow!</i>

209
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:05,491
Ow!

210
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,076
Ow-ee!

211
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:08,394
Where does it hurt?

212
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:11,831
I want my daddy.
Where's my daddy?

213
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:14,834
Ow!

214
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,502
Ow!

215
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:20,301
We were able to restore
circulation to her hands

216
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:22,586
and feet before
any permanent damage set in.

217
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:23,937
Primary Raynaud's?

218
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:27,024
The cold inside the MRI room
could have set it off.

219
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:29,026
Stress can also precipitate
the condition.

220
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:30,694
She's shown no evidence
of cold sensitivity,

221
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,980
and she has no problems
with MRI machines.

222
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:35,282
<i>There are other kinds</i>
<i>of stress.</i>

223
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,451
She heard you and your husband
fighting.

224
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:40,871
Unfortunately, she's heard
a lot worse than that before.

225
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:42,323
<i>It's not stress.</i>

226
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:46,210
Could be
secondary Raynaud's.

227
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:47,461
<i>Lupus is consistent</i>
<i>with Emily's symptoms.</i>

228
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:48,495
<i>Her lymph nodes</i>
<i>aren't enlarged,</i>

229
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,414
and she has shown
no signs

230
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:55,886
of immune activation.

231
00:11:55,954 --> 00:11:57,187
It could be
heavy metal poisoning.

232
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,306
From what?
The carousel?

233
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:00,974
<i>She was only on it</i>
<i>for a minute.</i>

234
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,344
Simon moved
into an old apartment building

235
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:04,511
three weeks ago.

236
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:05,896
<i>I'm sure he has no idea</i>

237
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:07,097
what the insulation's made of,

238
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:08,965
what kind of paint.

239
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,402
He's a good father,

240
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,020
but when it comes
to Emily's health--

241
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:14,671
<i>I'm gonna get his keys</i>

242
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:16,139
<i>and check</i>
<i>for environmentals.</i>

243
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:18,108
Lupus is a better fit.

244
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,109
I don't mean
to pull rank here,

245
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,445
but I am her mother.

246
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:23,330
I thought you said
you were here as a doctor.

247
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:25,282
And as a doctor,
I need parental consent.

248
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,316
See above.

249
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:27,818
<i>While I'm gone,</i>

250
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:31,939
please start her
on Chelation Therapy.

251
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:34,074
She's the mother.

252
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:37,277
So let's treat her
like any other mother.

253
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:46,019
I think we just hit
the environmental mother lode.

254
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:51,174
Funny she never mentioned
an entire basement

255
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:54,728
full of dangerous chemicals
and drugs.

256
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,847
You think she'd even let Emily
down here?

257
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:59,483
Yeah.

258
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:02,686
Apparently a lot.

259
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,133
You ever heard of Lex-2?

260
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,534
Read about it.

261
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:22,139
It's an experimental
aminoglycoside antibiotic.

262
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:27,344
Supposedly it can override
DNA errors in the ATM gene.

263
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:30,213
Doesn't mean she's giving it
to her daughter.

264
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:33,250
Anyone studying A-T
would be researching it.

265
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:35,269
How?

266
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:38,989
You see any lab rats
down here?

267
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:40,891
The only cage I see
is right there.

268
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:52,102
Go away.

269
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,405
I have a headache.

270
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:59,009
We don't have
to have sex.

271
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:04,014
Sometimes it's nice
just to cuddle and talk.

272
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:05,799
Me first.

273
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:08,585
You don't want
a second opinion.

274
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,654
You're already
on your fifth.

275
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:13,157
<i>You got Evans at Mercy,</i>
<i>Shaw at County,</i>

276
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:14,758
Foster at Johns Hopkins.

277
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:18,061
And every one of them
has given you the same advice.

278
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:20,147
You're nuts.

279
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:22,399
You don't just want chemo.

280
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,735
You want a dose so high,

281
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:28,271
there's a one-in-three chance
it'll kill you outright.

282
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:32,309
Question is,

283
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:35,829
why didn't you tell me?

284
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:38,582
Because you knew
I'd stop you.

285
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,817
<i>Which means</i>
<i>you've already found someone</i>

286
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:42,553
<i>insane enough</i>

287
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,421
or desperate enough

288
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:47,841
to give you what amounts
to a death dose of chemicals.

289
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:52,513
But who would be that stupid?

290
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,599
I'm thinking that the who
is you.

291
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:16,537
Where exactly
were you planning

292
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,555
on killing yourself?

293
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:22,459
'Cause I don't think Foreman
is gonna let you do it here.

294
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,179
My place.

295
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:28,799
I've been stockpiling equipment.
No.

296
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,868
No!
Stop.

297
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:40,010
I'm still healthy.

298
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,030
Why not go the extreme route now
when there's a better chance

299
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:44,448
of surviving it?

300
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:46,783
Statistically,

301
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:48,702
this treatment
has about the same chance

302
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,754
of killing you
as the thymoma does.

303
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:53,690
But a hell of a lot faster.

304
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:05,135
Nancy Wells,
cervical cancer,

305
00:16:05,202 --> 00:16:06,753
70% survival rate.

306
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:09,673
Died November 6, 1998,

307
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:11,892
64 years old.

308
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:15,879
Bernie Jones, melanoma,

309
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,048
89% survival rate.

310
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:20,050
October 10, 1999.

311
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:21,568
He was 52.

312
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:27,074
John Taylor.

313
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:28,325
Thyroid.

314
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:33,246
96% survival rate.

315
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:36,583
I promised him
he'd be fine.

316
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:39,586
Eight years old.

317
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:45,342
I am not going
to die slowly

318
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,711
in a hospital bed
under fluorescent lighting

319
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:49,079
with people stopping by
to gawk

320
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,931
and lie
about how I look.

321
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:52,466
Even a small chance
of that happening

322
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,918
is too big a chance
for me.

323
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,862
You're an idiot.

324
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,233
And the odds say
you're gonna die.

325
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:18,358
We'll do it at my place.

326
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,647
The only environmental factors
we think

327
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,148
caused your daughter's illness
are the ones

328
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,500
you shot her full of.

329
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,439
I tested the drug.
This is what I did

330
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:36,760
for a living
for ten years.

331
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,311
She's your child,
not a Guinea pig.

332
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:40,680
I tested it first.

333
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:43,099
On myself.

334
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,002
And in six months,
I didn't document

335
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,570
any adverse effects.

336
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:50,240
A trial of one
is basically irrelevant.

337
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:56,362
Respiratory infections
are common with A-T.

338
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,698
With Emily's mutation,
they are deadly,

339
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,533
and they get worse
every year.

340
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:04,838
Lex-2 won't be approved for
at least the next five years.

341
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:06,706
Emily, on the other hand,

342
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,510
wouldn't have survived
the winter.

343
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:15,565
What was I supposed to do?

344
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:19,853
There's a reason
for FDA requirements.

345
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:21,471
A study
at Jackson Memorial--

346
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:22,722
I know
about Gaines' research.

He's publishing next month.

348
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:25,408
Was.
I just spoke to him.

349
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:27,777
His team just linked
the use of Lex-2

350
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,979
to renal failure
in mice and rats.

351
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:37,987
<i>She needs an</i>

it's reversible.

and replaced with shards
of broken glass.

360
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:30,590
Should I be writing
any of this down?

361
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:32,575
<i>Your stomach</i>
<i>fills with bile.</i>

362
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,344
When you vomit,
it feels like someone's forcing

363
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:36,479
a white hot hammer
down your esophagus,

364
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:38,047
<i>tearing your flesh.</i>

365
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:39,599
<i>Blood's dripping</i>
<i>down the back of your throat,</i>

366
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:41,217
choking and gagging you

367
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,820
with the slick, coppery taste
of burnt pennies.

368
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:46,272
I am an Oncologist.
I know--

369
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:48,925
If you did,
we wouldn't be sitting here.

370
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:52,795
Day two: Your white blood cells
are gone,

371
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,280
<i>opening up your system</i>
<i>to attack.</i>

372
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:55,815
Your temperature skyrockets.

373
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,984
One second, your skin feels
like it's on fire.

374
00:19:58,068 --> 00:19:59,986
The next second,
it's entombed in ice.

375
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,972
Every pain sensor in your body
is firing at the same time

376
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,175
<i>until agony isn't even a word</i>
<i>or a concept--</i>

377
00:20:06,243 --> 00:20:08,011
<i>it's your only reality.</i>

378
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:09,462
You hallucinate.

379
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:11,698
You dream of death.

380
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:15,235
<i>And then the race begins.</i>

381
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:17,537
<i>Can your body claw</i>
<i>its way back in time</i>

382
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:20,073
<i>before the hostile organisms</i>
<i>and parasites</i>

383
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,624
<i>claim you permanently?</i>

384
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:26,129
Win, you live.
Lose, you die.

385
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:37,674
Now what are we doing here,
Wilson?

386
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:55,091
Kidney number one looks good.

387
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:58,595
Which means we'll probably take
the biopsy from two.

388
00:20:58,662 --> 00:21:01,464
Hey,
you're doing great.

389
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:04,417
Brave as always.

390
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:09,188
Pretty cool, eh?

391
00:21:09,273 --> 00:21:14,677
You want to try?

392
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:16,396
<i>What's wrong?</i>

393
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,731
My chest hurts.

394
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:24,854
It's definitely
not her kidneys.

395
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:26,873
It's okay.

396
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:33,663
Promise this'll taste
just as good coming up

397
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:36,049
as it did going down.

398
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:44,757
If things go wrong,

399
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:46,809
<i>I just want you</i>
<i>to know--</i>

400
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:50,730
If you're gonna say that you've
always been secretly gay for me,

401
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:52,482
everyone always
just kind of assumed it.

402
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,052
I just want you to know...

403
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,740
That I appreciate the risk
you're taking...

404
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:03,076
Pumping a human being
full of lethal chemicals

405
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,661
in your living room.

406
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:06,646
If I die,
it probably won't go over well

407
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:08,448
with your probation officer.

408
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:10,700
That's not gonna
be an issue.

409
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:13,369
I'm glad at least one of us
is confident.

410
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:14,404
<i>Not me.</i>

411
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,005
I've already identified

412
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,373
a couple of spots
to dump your body

413
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,742
if this goes south.

414
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,845
I've always enjoyed
Trinity Park.

415
00:22:22,913 --> 00:22:26,432
It does have a nice access
to the lake.

416
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:29,102
<i>Muscle spasms already?</i>

417
00:22:29,186 --> 00:22:31,437
No.
It's nothing really.

418
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:34,357
Good news.

419
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:35,992
Takes most people two bags

420
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,810
to get to that stage.

421
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:41,064
You're way ahead of schedule.

422
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:46,345
<i>You'll think it's stupid.</i>

423
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:48,307
<i>That hasn't stopped you before.</i>

424
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,594
I just always thought,

425
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:54,680
when I got old or sick,

426
00:22:54,732 --> 00:23:00,019
I'd have a wife or kids
to look after me.

427
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,854
<i>And in this scenario,</i>

428
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,573
<i>are your loving wife and kids</i>

429
00:23:03,657 --> 00:23:06,392
holding the life support cord,

430
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:09,829
<i>or are they thumbing</i>
<i>through your will?</i>

431
00:23:09,896 --> 00:23:12,165
I'm in it, right?

432
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:14,667
Mm.

433
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:17,537
You have everything you need
right here.

434
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,705
We both do.

435
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,044
Painkiller.

436
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,180
<i>Industrial strength.</i>

437
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:31,083
Level: Awesome.

438
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,759
We're on vacation.

439
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:49,302
That is nice.

440
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,543
<i>Her kidneys are fine.</i>

441
00:23:57,611 --> 00:23:58,711
I don't think
we're looking at side effects

442
00:23:58,778 --> 00:23:59,996
from the Lex-2.

443
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,380
She's prone
to respiratory infection.

444
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:03,216
- Pneumonia?
- No persistent cough,

445
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:04,584
chills, or excess sweating.

446
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,085
What about a pulmonary embolism?

447
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:07,420
Fits coughing up blood,
but a clot?

448
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:08,787
From what?

449
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,922
Bruising from when she fell
off the carousel.

450
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:12,391
<i>Contusion damages a deep vein,</i>

451
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,676
causes a clot.

452
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,228
A piece breaks off,
travels to her lungs.

453
00:24:15,295 --> 00:24:17,313
We need to get her
on heparin now.

454
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:19,649
Another embolism could cause
a heart attack

455
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:20,799
or a stroke.

456
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,137
What's wrong?
Is it Emily?

457
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:26,856
Sort of.

458
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,575
<i>You can't do this.</i>

459
00:24:29,643 --> 00:24:31,644
I'm taking her to Mercy.

460
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:33,496
Everything you people have done
has just made her worse.

461
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,414
You don't have the right.
We have joint custody.

462
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:36,616
Where was my right
when you were treating

463
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:37,583
our daughter
like a lab rat?

464
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:38,701
She'd be dead
if I hadn't.

465
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:41,871
Stop it.

466
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:43,822
Your daughter deserves
better than this.

467
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:49,378
It's okay, sweetie.

468
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:51,264
Mommy and I
are just gonna talk.

469
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:53,349
<i>Okay?</i>

470
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:54,700
You want to get
some candy?

471
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:05,010
We believe Emily has a clot
in her lungs.

472
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:06,562
If you leave now,
she could die

473
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:08,364
before her new doctors
are even up to speed.

474
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:10,182
From her A-T?

475
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:12,118
From the fall
off the carousel.

476
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:24,863
Now can we just stop blaming
each other

477
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:26,249
and do the right thing here?

478
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,633
You're really gonna equate
the two?

479
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:31,170
No, you were giving her
two minutes of fun.

480
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:33,589
I was trying
to save her life.

481
00:25:33,674 --> 00:25:36,325
What's her best friend's name?

482
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,078
What's the name
of her favorite teacher?

483
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:42,582
Why does she hate that
stuffed animal you gave her?

484
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:45,368
She's been having nightmares
about penguins all month.

485
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,674
What's her blood type?

486
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,548
Rh factor?
Her serum immunoglobulin levels?

487
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:01,434
I don't care.
Those are letters and numbers.

488
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:02,852
- That's not her.
- What about the variant

489
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:07,106
in her e14 ATM intergenic
promoter region?

490
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:10,893
Because that's what's killing
your daughter.

491
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:15,448
Unless I can find a way
to reactivate it.

492
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,355
Just make her better.

493
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:53,436
<i>You don't look too good,</i>
<i>mister.</i>

494
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,801
How did you get in here?

495
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:10,269
The door.

496
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,138
Are you, like, sick
or something?

497
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:15,207
Where's House?

498
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,143
Where are your parents?

499
00:27:22,632 --> 00:27:26,018
Oh, I know you.
You live in the building, right?

500
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:28,154
<i>What's your name?</i>

501
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:31,190
You don't remember?

502
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:34,727
House.

503
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,873
You promised me
I'd go home again, Dr. Wilson.

504
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:52,445
You said it wasn't my fault.

505
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,083
It wasn't, John.

506
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,819
If I didn't do nothing wrong,

507
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,821
why did I die?

508
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,956
<i>I don't know.</i>

509
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,179
Look...

510
00:28:10,263 --> 00:28:12,465
I shouldn't have done this.

511
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:20,840
Am I dead?

512
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,111
Not yet.

513
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,214
It just feels that way.

514
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:29,849
Are you okay?

515
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,452
I mean, apart from the pain,
vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps?

516
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:52,571
<i>I worked six months</i>
<i>in a research lab</i>

517
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:53,773
<i>after med school.</i>

518
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,475
You get so focused.

519
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,545
Once I didn't eat
for two days.

520
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:03,015
It's easy to forget
what actually matters.

521
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,817
I didn't.

522
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:09,922
Yeah, it sucks
I got her the wrong doll, but...

523
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,324
Good news.

524
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,026
Emily's lungs
are clear.

525
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:16,045
No clot.
And bad news.

526
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,746
We still don't know
what's happening to her.

527
00:29:17,831 --> 00:29:19,248
Whatever it is,
there's liver involvement.

528
00:29:19,332 --> 00:29:21,500
Her eyes are jaundiced.

529
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,086
<i>Her liver's failing.</i>

530
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:28,242
<i>We found a blockage</i>
<i>in her hepatic vein,</i>

531
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:30,322
<i>which is restricting blood flow</i>
<i>to her liver.</i>

532
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:31,688
<i>Polycythemia vera?</i>

533
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:33,173
<i>Red blood counts are normal.</i>

534
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:35,759
<i>Could be some sort</i>
<i>of connective tissue disorder.</i>

535
00:29:35,844 --> 00:29:38,545
What if--

536
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:41,682
what if we're just seeing
the end result

537
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:44,751
<i>of her condition?</i>

538
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,464
She's unique.

539
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:52,585
One screwed-up gene
from each of us.

540
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,146
<i>Let's stick with our process.</i>

541
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:59,166
I shouldn't be here.

542
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,425
<i>What are we missing?</i>

543
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:09,976
Advanced Lyme disease.

544
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:11,978
Would have seen it
in the blood.

545
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:13,680
He said advanced.

546
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:14,714
We wouldn't pick it up
in her blood

547
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:15,682
if it's in her organs

548
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:16,883
and nervous system now.

549
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:18,402
It fits everything
but the nosebleed.

550
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:21,271
But why is it attacking now,
all at once?

551
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:23,023
What's changed?

552
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:25,525
Elizabeth has.

553
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:28,462
<i>She stopped giving Emily</i>
<i>the Lex-2.</i>

554
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:30,396
<i>It's</i>
<i>an aminoglycoside antibiotic.</i>

555
00:30:30,448 --> 00:30:33,583
It's what was keeping
the Lyme in check.

556
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:36,703
We need to start her
on amoxicillin.

557
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:43,710
Mm.

558
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:05,265
You lied.

559
00:31:05,316 --> 00:31:07,984
Doesn't taste better
coming back up.

560
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:10,570
Here's another one.
You look good.

561
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:14,441
What's
the white blood cell count?

562
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:21,414
It's down to 1,000,
still dropping.

563
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:30,223
I need
more morphine.

564
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:32,175
We're out.

565
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,978
You've been using
my personal supply

566
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,063
of painkillers
for the last eight hours.

567
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:42,652
You have--
you have enough for both of us?

568
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:47,824
I've got enough stashed
around here for a minyan.

569
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,911
Mm.

570
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:58,952
Just remember
they're a gift.

571
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:02,005
So it's rude
to keep throwing them up.

572
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,490
Found that out with
those candlesticks you got me.

573
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:53,206
We think it's Lyme.

574
00:32:53,257 --> 00:32:55,892
<i>I would have seen</i>
<i>signs of that.</i>

575
00:32:55,977 --> 00:32:57,561
Not if the Lex-2 was keeping it
in check.

576
00:32:57,628 --> 00:32:59,346
We live in the city.

577
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:01,514
We don't have pets.

578
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:03,183
She's never even been
in the woods.

579
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:05,318
Yes, I have.

580
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:06,820
With daddy.

581
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:12,192
I should have told you,

582
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,277
<i>but I know</i>
<i>how you feel about it.</i>

583
00:33:14,362 --> 00:33:15,779
I grew up hunting
with my dad.

584
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:17,247
I wanted to share it
with my daughter

585
00:33:17,315 --> 00:33:18,331
<i>at least once.</i>

586
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,899
We only took pictures.

587
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,251
You don't need
to be mad.

588
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,586
<i>Maybe we should step outside.</i>

589
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,170
<i>No.</i>

590
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:29,409
We can't protect her
from everything.

591
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:36,132
I assume you'll need
a lumbar puncture to confirm.

592
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,137
<i>You lost a contact?</i>

593
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:06,557
Going to
the little boy's room.

594
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:09,643
They're called adult diapers
for a reason.

595
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,894
Use it.

596
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:11,845
I did,
and if you think

597
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:13,213
I'm gonna let you change me--

598
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:14,565
It's okay.
I'm a doctor.

599
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:15,682
Hey!

600
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,985
<i>Just leave me alone.</i>

601
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:29,163
It's pathetic.

602
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,166
I'm pathetic.

603
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:33,534
An oncologist
with cancer.

604
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:36,203
Of all the things
that could be killing me...

605
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:38,038
It's like the universe
is giving me

606
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:39,790
the big middle finger.

607
00:34:45,547 --> 00:34:47,414
The universe doesn't care--

608
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:49,016
<i>Why me?</i>

609
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,935
I'm always telling my patients

610
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,754
not to torture themselves,
because there's no answer.

611
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:56,390
Sound advice.

612
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,225
It's cruel advice.

613
00:34:58,293 --> 00:34:59,893
They were just trying
to make sense

614
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:01,645
of what was happening
to them,

615
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:05,432
and I'm there telling them
not to bother?

616
00:35:05,483 --> 00:35:09,169
I should have spent my life
being more like you.

617
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:12,656
Should have been a manipulative,
self-centered,

618
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,107
narcissistic ass

619
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,276
who brought misery
to everything and everyone

620
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:18,662
in his life.

621
00:35:23,084 --> 00:35:25,118
You'd still have cancer.

622
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,587
Yeah!

623
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:29,339
But at least I'd feel
like I deserved it.

624
00:35:35,063 --> 00:35:37,731
Do you think my parents
will get back together?

625
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:43,987
I don't know.

626
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:45,405
I'm sure
they love each other, but--

627
00:35:45,473 --> 00:35:47,807
They only fight
about me.

628
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:51,962
That's because they care
so much.

629
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,048
So maybe when I die,

630
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:57,818
they'll get back together.

631
00:36:03,157 --> 00:36:05,259
Emily, what's wrong?

632
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:07,377
I can't move my arm.

633
00:36:15,637 --> 00:36:18,188
Just keep your arms up for me.

634
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:19,273
What's happening to her?

635
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,174
She's having a stroke.

636
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,350
Okay, your heart rate's up,
BP's tanking.

637
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:31,535
White blood count's
at 500.

638
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,520
We have to go
to the hospital now.

639
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:35,355
No.
I don't have the equipment

640
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:36,657
or the meds
to handle this.

641
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,742
No.
Win or lose.

642
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:40,860
Win or lose.
That was the deal.

643
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:43,330
That was the deal
when there was an "or".

644
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,365
You can't win this.

645
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:47,134
No.

646
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:52,139
No.
I'd rather die here.

647
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:54,474
Not in an ambulance.

648
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:57,594
Not in a hospital.

649
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,096
Please,

650
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,097
you can't do that
to me.

651
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:03,066
I can't--

652
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:06,353
House...

653
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:09,523
Please.

654
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:13,393
Promise me
that you won't do that to me.

655
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,913
Promise me.

656
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:21,919
Okay,
I promise.

657
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,250
Stroke.

658
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,321
Blockage
in her hepatic vein,

659
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:34,689
coughing blood,

660
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,707
trouble breathing,

661
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,075
and Raynaud's.

662
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,877
If we hadn't
already ruled it out,

663
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:41,195
it sounds like textbook
pulmonary embolism.

664
00:37:41,247 --> 00:37:43,248
What mimics a clot
but isn't a clot?

665
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:44,382
Fungal infection.

666
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,717
Her CSF was clean.

667
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:47,502
No bacterial
or fungal markers.

668
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,920
<i>Anyone tried calling House?</i>

669
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,171
<i>Not picking up.</i>

670
00:37:50,222 --> 00:37:50,922
<i>Or returning messages or texts.</i>

671
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:52,474
We're on our own here,

672
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,676
so just give me
some theories we can use.

673
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:56,645
Hematologic malignancies.

674
00:37:56,712 --> 00:37:59,948
A-T patients are more prone
to that form of cancer.

675
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:01,516
You think cancer would present

676
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,685
<i>and kill her</i>
<i>in three days?</i>

677
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:05,987
Not cancer.

678
00:38:06,055 --> 00:38:08,990
But a tumor could act
like a clot.

679
00:38:09,058 --> 00:38:10,075
An atrial myxoma.

680
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:15,113
A primary heart tumor.

681
00:38:15,197 --> 00:38:16,731
The swinging motion
of the myxoma

682
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:17,999
intermittently blocked
the flow of blood

683
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,334
through the right atrium.

684
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,736
Inflow blockage stagnated
the hepatic vein,

685
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,738
which clotted
and caused liver failure.

686
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:26,675
Outflow blockage caused the
Raynaud's phenomenon and stroke.

687
00:38:26,742 --> 00:38:28,343
Pieces of the tumor broke off

688
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,244
and lodged
in the lungs,

689
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:31,579
<i>causing Emily's</i>
<i>breathing problems</i>

690
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,014
<i>and the coughing blood.</i>

691
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:34,415
We'll remove the tumor
surgically,

692
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:37,185
and hopefully the biopsy reveals
it's benign.

693
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:17,125
Wow.
You--

694
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:18,977
you really look
like crap.

695
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:23,598
Been fighting a cold
lately.

696
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:26,968
Seven to ten days
for the swelling to go down.

697
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:29,521
Then we rescan
and schedule the surgery.

698
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:48,156
I seem to recall

699
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:49,424
I said some things
to you--

700
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:50,491
<i>You talked a lot.</i>

701
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:51,876
I stopped listening

702
00:39:51,961 --> 00:39:55,330
after you confessed
your fear of dolphins.

703
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:00,668
Can we just tone down
the bromance a few notches?

704
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,670
My leg is killing me.

705
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:05,056
One last favor.

706
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:09,861
I'd like to actually make it
to the bathroom this time.

707
00:40:26,295 --> 00:40:28,713
I thought you said
you had plenty of Vicodin.

708
00:40:28,798 --> 00:40:31,299
Everybody lies.

709
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:34,302
So the way I felt,
you feel that, what,

710
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:37,038
most of the time?

711
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:38,873
It really does suck
being you, doesn't it?

712
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:41,743
At least
I don't have cancer.

713
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,075
The tumor was benign.

714
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,928
<i>And we were able</i>
<i>to remove all of it.</i>

715
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:02,747
Does this mean
I'm not sick anymore?

716
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:09,103
No, honey.

717
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:10,738
<i>The tumor didn't cause</i>

718
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:13,107
<i>your genetic condition.</i>

719
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:16,044
You're still sick.

720
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:18,479
<i>But we never let that</i>
<i>stop us before, right?</i>

721
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,952
So what do you want to do
when we get out of here?

722
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:25,170
Have you been
to the aquarium?

723
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:26,838
It's pretty cool.
Can we go, daddy?

724
00:41:26,922 --> 00:41:29,874
You bet.

725
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,459
Me too?

726
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,929
Can she come
with us?

727
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:38,299
You know mommy never has
to ask.

728
00:41:47,843 --> 00:41:50,344
I'll see you at lunch.
