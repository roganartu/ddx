1
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:03,548
Two spades.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,624
Three hearts.

3
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:08,168
It's all yours.

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,632
I fold.

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,355
And that's five.

6
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:15,955
- And that's six.
- Yay!

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,145
Not bad.

8
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:21,195
On a slam contract, you normally
want to play your winners early.

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,115
Sorry, Dad.

10
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:24,454
Nah. You're learning.
You're doing fine.

11
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:27,569
Woman:
Connie Gilman's a good player.
And a widow.

12
00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:31,970
I should, uh, take her out
because she can play bridge.

13
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,459
You're a true romantic.

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,019
Woman 2:
You should ask somebody out.
You think Cecile's not dating yet?

15
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:41,126
- Cecile was dating before she left.
- Oh, shut up, Marv.

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,217
No. I have a partner.
And she's doing great.

17
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,373
Amy should be out having fun.

18
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:49,393
I'm having fun.

19
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:50,616
Yeah.

20
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:53,886
Look like you're having
the time of your life.

21
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,905
- One no trump.
- (Woman, laughing) Ooh!

22
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,279
I'm just...a little nauseous.
I, uh, I think I ate too much.

23
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,614
- Can we take a break?
- Of course.

24
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,357
Excuse us.

25
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:16,917
What did you eat?

26
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:18,062
Nothing weird.

27
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,642
- Have you been drinking?
- No, Dad. You know I don't--

28
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:22,869
Because I don't mind if you--

29
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,329
Dad?

30
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,424
[Echoing] Dad?

31
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:31,158
Dad, what are you doing?

32
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:38,225
You're scaring me.
It hurts. Let go!

33
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:40,268
What are you doing?

34
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:42,288
Man:
Henry?

35
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:46,142
Henry.
Let go of her.

36
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:51,475
The occasional drink
doesn't bother me. But...

37
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:53,962
What?

38
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,106
Are you okay?

39
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,147
What's the matter?

40
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:07,636
2X14 - Sex Kills

41
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:32,457
Original Airdate (FOX):  7 March-2006

42
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:40,503
You had what's called
an "absence seizure."

43
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:42,521
Anything like that
happen to you before?

44
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:43,775
No, Nothing.

45
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,999
He's been really healthy.
He jogs, he eats right. He--

46
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,023
I--well, I did have
a headache last Sunday.

47
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:53,963
And for the past two years,
I've been getting acid reflux a lot.

48
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:57,548
And I thought that, uh,
antacids were all I needed.

49
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,206
Should I have come in sooner?

50
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:01,204
For acid reflux and a headache?

51
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:10,494
Well, I--you know,
I hear the coffee downstairs
is really good.

52
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:12,688
Could you get me a cup, Honey?

53
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,340
Would you mind
closing the blinds?

54
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:26,397
Foreman:
His right testicle is almost
twice as big as his left.

55
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:27,390
Cool.

56
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,456
It's probably testicular cancer.

57
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,725
Mmm, no.
That's impossible.

58
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:35,500
- The symptoms all indicate--
- The shoes aren't right.

59
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:40,491
Here's how testicular cancer
would manifest itself.

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,390
First, the patient would get
the exact symptoms that he's got.

61
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:45,180
Then Foreman would examine him.

62
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:49,611
Then he'd suspect
testicular cancer on account of
the symptoms being so perfect.

63
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:52,334
Then he'd stick a needle in it.
Then he'd call a surgeon.

64
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:56,582
And while that guy operates,
the rest of us would be out bowling.

65
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,708
And since we're not
wearing bowling shoes,

66
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:02,061
the disease obviously
did not progress in that fashion.

67
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:04,984
LP showed some white cells.
But his MRI is clean.

68
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:08,792
Sure. If you call a microabscess
in his brain "clean."

69
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:12,176
What, you don't trust me?

70
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,343
Are you talking about
the left temporal lobe?

71
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:16,411
Neat. You can see
through my hand.

72
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:18,603
- It's just a shadow.
- Or it's an infection.

73
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:23,302
When guys have brain/crotch problems,
it's usually the result of using
one too much and the other too little.

74
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:26,499
Blood and urine were negative for
syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.

75
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,587
So treat him for all three.
Stat.

76
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:31,149
Um...negative means
he doesn't have it.

77
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,861
No. Negative means
he probably doesn't have it.
Which means he probably has cancer.

78
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:36,675
I thought we were wearing
the wrong shoes for cancer.

79
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,392
We're wearing the wrong shoes
for testicular cancer.

80
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:41,249
They're perfect for lymphoma.

81
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,543
Except Chase's.
They're just goofy.

82
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:47,501
Lymphoma could cause infiltrants
in his reproductive organs and his brain.

83
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:49,974
If it's this advanced,
he's dead no matter what we do.

84
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:53,905
So give him the STD meds
and hope the tests were wrong.

85
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,402
Svinnuk.

86
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:03,245
Who's the lucky woman?

87
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:05,118
My wife.

88
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:07,592
No, I don't want to know
who gets the chocolates.

89
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,747
I want to know who
you're having the affair with.

90
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:13,115
Fell on his head as a child.
Tragic.

91
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,239
Norwegian chocolate.

92
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:18,231
Frankly,
you buy that stuff,
the terrorists win.

93
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:22,940
Some people bottle up their feelings,
have them come out as physical pain.

94
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:26,780
Healthy  human beings express feelings,
such as affection, by giving gifts.

95
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,576
Gifts express guilt.

96
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,264
The more expensive the expression,
the deeper the guilt. That's a $12 box.

97
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,494
So either you haven't
slept with her yet,
or she wasn't that good.

98
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:37,399
It's not all about sex, House.

99
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:39,880
Really?
When did that change?

100
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:44,633
I want to get Depo-Provera.

101
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:49,652
Actually, at your age,
as long as you're careful,

102
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:52,360
the risk of you getting
pregnant is pretty limited.

103
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,651
Yeah,  but it would
calm me down.

104
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,286
Right? If I get
a high enough dose.

105
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,127
You mean
"calm" as in a peaceful lake,
on cool summer evening?

106
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:05,740
Or in the lesser used meaning of,
nothing can ever bother you again
because life has absolutely no meaning?

107
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:09,156
High dose of Depo-Provera
will chemically castrate you.

108
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:10,696
Yeah.

109
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:17,626
Okay. I'm gonna
get up to leave now.

110
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,771
And I'm gonna walk to that door,
turn the handle.

111
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,979
And then you're
suddenly gonna decide that
you have to tell me the truth.

112
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,358
I'm gonna have to turn around
and come all the way back.

113
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:27,297
See, the thing is,
my leg hurts.

114
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:30,090
Can we cut the walking
out of the equation?

115
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,504
I love cows.

116
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,562
Any  particular...variety?

117
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:43,798
Guernseys? Holsteins?

118
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:45,673
Which are the black and white ones?

119
00:06:45,757 --> 00:06:47,025
Oh, God.

120
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:50,213
I pass a farm
on my way to school.

121
00:06:50,364 --> 00:06:51,944
And they're so beautiful.

122
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,433
They're so majestic.
I dream about them.

123
00:06:56,824 --> 00:07:00,520
Leather shoes, hamburgers.
How can anybody do that to a cow?

124
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,627
Make love, not belts.
It's beautiful.

125
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:05,947
- I haven't actually--
- Well, relax.

126
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,249
Something we doctors
deal with all the time.

127
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:10,430
I'm gonna write you
the name of a drug.

128
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:13,567
You don't need a prescription.
And it looks just like Depo-Provera.

129
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:16,230
- But does it do the same thing?
- Oh, God, no.

130
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:20,230
That stuff has
all sorts of nasty side effects.
It's real medicine.

131
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:21,946
No, this is all you need.

132
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,949
Your frat buddies will
be completely fooled.

133
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,668
Tell them how appalled
the doctor was.

134
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:29,627
Lots of laughs.

135
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:33,465
We think you may have
a sexually transmitted disease.

136
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:34,934
No. It's not possible.

137
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,697
Sir, maybe we should
speak in private?

138
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:39,491
Have you tested him for this?

139
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:40,572
The tests were negative.

140
00:07:40,656 --> 00:07:42,593
Well, then it's not that.

141
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:45,154
So what else could it be?

142
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,625
Nothing good.

143
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,699
If you've been having sex,
you have to tell me.

144
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:53,989
I have not had sex
since my divorce.

145
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:58,960
I didn't ask him
to take the medicine.

146
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,939
I asked you
to give him the medicine.

147
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,796
He hasn't had sex
in over a year.

148
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:05,098
- He's lying.
- He knows what's at stake.

149
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,790
We should start treating him
for lymphoma right away.

150
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:10,412
- Maybe if we hit him hard and fast--
- Wilson!

151
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,600
How long can you
go without sex?

152
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:14,433
How long can you
go without annoying people?

153
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,461
No, seriously.
Week? Month?

154
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm not having an affair.

155
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:20,736
I didn't say you were.
Not in this conversation.

156
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,211
We're talking about a patient.

157
00:08:22,364 --> 00:08:25,438
People have impulse control.
We don't need sex.

158
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:28,808
Well, not like air.
But as a biological imperative,
sure we do.

159
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:31,761
There's two things
we get stupid for.
Money and sex.

160
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:34,293
And since money rarely
enters the bloodstream...

161
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:36,898
Was his daughter in the room
when you asked if he'd had sex?

162
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,774
I told him we could talk privately.
He didn't care if she was there.

163
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,812
It's almost noon.
Little girl would go to lunch.

164
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:46,246
Soon as she's out the door,
you're gonna get paged.
Then you page me.

165
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,053
[Foreman's pager beeps]

166
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,590
Lunch is early, huh?

167
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:00,996
Hi.

168
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:03,208
I'm Dr. House.

169
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:06,881
I hear you'd rather die
than admit you had sex.

170
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:10,656
I'm sorry. I...
couldn't tell my daughter.

171
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,103
Right. 'Cause she's...what, 22?

172
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,226
I slept with her mom.

173
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:19,764
She probably knows
that's happened already.

Roll over.

175
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:26,957
My wife had an affair.
I forgave her.

176
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:31,617
She had another affair.
And I forgave her again. And...

177
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:34,414
Amy thinks I was an idiot.

178
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:37,658
So smart.
You must be very proud.
Roll over.

179
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,529
I assume you've been in love.

180
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,121
Is that the one that
makes your pants feel funny?

181
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,704
I'm starting you
on a cocktail of STD meds.

182
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:47,761
Amy is just getting over it.

183
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,682
She barely spoke to her mom
for months actually.

184
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:55,716
If she thought that
it was happening again,
that that's why I got sick--

185
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:05,226
We just happened to be at
the same Italian cheese-tasting thing.

186
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,616
Cheese is the devil's play thing.

187
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,244
It was just the one night.

188
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:12,784
Oh, you're obviously
completely over her.

189
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:16,886
Amy thinks love leads you
to make stupid choices.

190
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,382
You're certainly setting
a good example for her.

191
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,121
Yeah. She just doesn't get it.

192
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:26,481
If you're not prepared to look stupid,
then nothing great is
ever gonna happen, right?

193
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:33,245
On the other hand,
I guess your testicles
aren't going to explode either.

Is everything okay?

197
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:47,713
How's that possible?

- Here you go.
- 40 milligrams furosemide.

207
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,553
How would an STD do this?

208
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:35,780
It wouldn't.

209

It was flash pulmonary edema.

210
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:48,482
We took a liter of fluid off, but
the problem wasn't with his lungs.
It's his heart.

211
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:51,246
There are vegetations
obstructing his mitral valve.

212
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,366
It's not an STD.
Lymphoma wouldn't
erupt that suddenly.

213
00:11:54,428 --> 00:11:59,163
So what is it, then?
A disease that attacks
his brain, heart, and testicles.

214
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,342
I think Byron wrote about that.

215
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:02,805
Could be psittacosis.

216
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:04,870

- Was it sheep cheese?
- Might have been. Why?

- Was it soft?
- Yeah.

- Yeah. But how did you--
- That was regularlow-fat American.

I mean, nobody else
at the church got sick.

246

99.9 % of Christians have
so much acid in their stomach,

they become churning cauldrons of death

But you were taking antacids
for your acid reflux.

- Then why are you--
- Advocating for my patient.

338
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:05,722
I've got clinic duty.

339
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:08,919
I need you to get me the files
on everybody who dies here today.

340
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:12,034
You really think this thing'll
change their decision?

341
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,212
Nope.

342
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:22,180
Mooooo!

343
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,648
I think I broke my ankle.

344
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:27,247
I was kicked. By a hoof.

345
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:31,295
I'm so in love.
She was so beautiful.

346
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:33,665
- Which one?
- One of the black and white ones.

347
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:36,341
- I'm not sure what type.
- Which "type"? Which one?

348
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,823
I want a name.

349
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:41,704
- Why would it have a name?
- Well, not "it." She. Or he.

350
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:44,208
I want to know
her dreams, her hopes.

351
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:45,943
It's a cow.

352
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:48,956
Hey, I'm not the one
who said he was in love.

353
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:57,059
People who actually have this condition
rationalize it. They dismiss it.
They don't elevate it to the level of poetry.

354
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:59,411
Plus there's
a wooden splinter in there.

355
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,338
So either you hit yourself
with a two-by-four
or Elsie has a peg leg.

356
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:05,313
I'm off duty at 6:00.

357
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:08,348
Give yourself another whack,
come back and scam somebody else.

358
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:12,191
I'm sick. And you're a doctor.
You have a duty to help me.

359
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,579
Technically I don't
have to treat anybody.

360
00:20:15,723 --> 00:20:21,789
Before running a series of
painful and often humiliating tests.

361
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,658
Whatever you need.

362
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:30,247
90-year-old woman
died of pneumonia.

363
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,623
Unless she has a bionic heart,
what's next?

364
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:37,408
- Um...baby died in the ICU.
- Babies are useless.

365
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:39,898
They've got hearts the size
of ping-pong balls. Next?

366
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,016
Um...40-year-old male...

367
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:44,542
Yes?

368
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,071
Heart attack.

369
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:49,828
If you really cared about me,
you'd find me a better corpse.

370
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:52,735
There's no other deaths.
There's one woman who
was in a car accident.

371
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,093
Bad one, I hope.

372
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:56,373
The organ procurement people
have been notified.

373
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:57,398
Give me her file.

374
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,243
It's in the ER.
They're still working on her.

375
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,994
- Age?
- About 40.

376
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,654
- Young. Damn.
- Young is good.

377
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:07,621
- Smoker?
- Don't know.

378
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:08,571
Find out.

379
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:11,633
She's still alive.
Even if we get on the list,
we can't go near her until--

380
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:13,129
Overweight?

381
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:15,368
She's on the hefty side.

382
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:17,547
Excellent.
Our odds just went up.

383
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:19,476
What odds?
What is this?

384
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,814
60 % of potential donor hearts
get tossed in the trash because
there's something wrong with them.

385
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:26,708
With fat people,
it's closer to 80.

386
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,401
But if her heart's
no good, then--

387
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:32,152
Big, fat, sloppy heart.
Beats no heart at all.

388
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:52,992
- Are you Mr. Neuberger?
- Yes.

389
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,254
I'm Dr. House.

390
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:56,085
Need to ask you a few questions
about your wife.

391
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:57,266
Is she gonna be okay?

392
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,190
I'm afraid I don't know that.

393
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,999
Could you tell me
about her accident?

394
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,439
They, uh, think she fell asleep,
went off the road.
That's all they told me.

395
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:06,922
Any problems with her health
up until now?

396
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:07,878
Why?

397
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:11,201
Please, it's important.

398
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,663
Um...

399
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,585
she had a fever today,
but otherwise she was--

400
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:15,977
How high?

401
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:17,872
About 101.

402
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,639
She hasn't missed a day
of teaching in years.

403
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:24,642
And I should've
made her stay home.

404
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:27,270
Any other symptoms?

405
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:30,790
A stomachache. Who cares?
She was in a car crash.

406
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:31,804
- Mr. Neuberger.
- Yeah.

407
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:35,303
My name's Ellen Stambler.
I'm the organ procurement coordinator
for Southern New Jersey.

408
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,515
I just want to assure you
that we'll treat her organs
with care and dignity.

409
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:43,450
Her organs?

410
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,325
Laura died?

411
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:51,582
I--I'm sorry.
I thought, um--

412
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,631
She was just pronounced dead.
I thought he was telling you.

413
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:57,942
I didn't know.

414
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,714
You should never make assumptions.

415
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,653
What did you want from me?

416
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,702
I'm sorry for your loss.

417
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:15,372
But I need your wife's heart.

418
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:26,268
The organ procurement coordinator
just left the hospital.

419
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:29,284
Means we got lucky.
Either that or she's getting lunch.

420
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:32,764
Dead woman's last name
have a "U" or "W"?

421
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:34,924
You're hacking into
a confidential patient file?

422
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:36,679
Is that a problem for you?

423
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,328
It's a "U". N-E-U.

424
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:41,418
Berger.

425
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:49,045
Three minutes ago,
her organs were officially
declared not viable.

426
00:23:49,124 --> 00:23:51,153
Time to go dumpster diving.

427
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:00,901
Hey.

428
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,238
She's got hepatitis C.
Her ALTs are three times normal.

429
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:07,117
With Henry's immune system down,
an infected heart will kill him.

430
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:08,954
Fortunately,
she didn't have hep C.

431
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:11,431
- She tested positive.
- Her history says otherwise.

432
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:13,779
Her husband told me
she was running a fever
with stomach pains.

433
00:24:13,892 --> 00:24:16,060
Not symptomatic of hep C.

434
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,715
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

435
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,679
Hey. What are you doing?

436
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:54,358
Again, sorry.

437
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:56,371
But we need to talk.

438
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,879
Mr. Neuberger has every right
to take his wife off the ventilator.

439
00:25:00,963 --> 00:25:03,114
His wife signed
an organ donor card.

440
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:06,051
Which became invalid when
her organs were turned down.

441
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:08,831
I can use them!
I just need some time.

442
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:10,808
Committee says
they won't take her heart.

443
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:13,078
Another committee says
the guy can't have a heart.

444
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,861
It's a marriage made in heaven.

445
00:25:14,945 --> 00:25:16,683
I can find a surgical team
that can do this.

446
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,606
Classified as experimental,
it's not gonna screw
with their numbers.

447
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,737
- This is what she wanted.
- No.

448
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:21,772
She wanted her organs to help--

449
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:24,081
She never wanted to
be kept alive on a ventilator.

450
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:26,120
She's not. She's dead!

451
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:29,040
She's not in pain.
She's not suffering.
It's just her...

452
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:31,155
meat we're dealing with here.

453
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:36,093
- This is my wife.
- Not anymore.

454
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:38,994
She deserves some respect.
Some dignity.

455
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,714
- I respect the living.
- Right.

456
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,348
That is why you made me think
that you were her doctor.

457
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,044
Made me believe that
maybe there was some hope.

458
00:25:46,843 --> 00:25:48,288
I never said that
I was her doctor.

459
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:50,568
Fine, you didn't lie.
But you sure as hell
didn't give me any respect.

460
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:52,985
I am taking her
off the machines. Now.

461
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:56,750
Nicely played.

462
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,171
It's not over.

463
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,606
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Neuberger?

464
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:08,644
Yeah. Why?

465
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:10,640
I'm Amy Arrington.

466
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,099
I wanted to thank you.

467
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:25,292
This girl's father will die
by next weekend unless
he gets your wife's heart.

468
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,808
House. Don't you think
that's a little manipulative?

469
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:31,064
No. It's hugely manipulative.

470
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:32,567
You're an ass.

471
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:35,897
Hey. Listen!
You take your wife
off life support,

472
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,606
and I'll have forgotten
about this in two weeks.

473
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:41,243
- Gail here, on the other hand--
- Amy.

474
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,957
Whatever.

475
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:48,069
You're mad at me.
Fine, I get that.
Take it out on me. Not on her.

476
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,958
Oof!

477
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,823
Fine. Your dad can, uh...
have her heart.

478
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:35,312
Fever. Stomach pain.
Raised liver enzymes.

479
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,422
She's sick.

480
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:38,666
Worse than that.
She's dead.

481
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,761
My point is,
even if it's not hep C,
it's something.

482
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:45,634
They turned her down as a donor
because if we put that heart
into someone, they won't survive.

483
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:47,525
Whatever made her sick
will kill him.

484
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:50,088
Yeah. So what is it?

485
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,316
Enzymes indicate--

486
00:27:51,384 --> 00:27:54,154
You want us to do
a differential diagnosis
on a dead person?

487
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:55,391
We're going to cure her.

488
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:56,745
We're going to cure death?

489
00:27:56,852 --> 00:28:00,193
[Laughs theatrically like a demon]
Doubt it.

490
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:04,049
Just want to get the infection
out of her heart before
we get the heart out of her.

491
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:05,971
The fever indicates an infection.

492
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:09,040
She probably has hep C
and a bad case of the flu.

493
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:13,403
Let's assume, just for fun,
that the answer is something
that might be helpful.

494
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,818
Fever and belly pain
could be a gall bladder infection.

495
00:28:16,902 --> 00:28:18,269
Like that.

496
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:20,558
Do an MRI. Stat.

497
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:30,169
You really don't need to be here.

498
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:33,981
I assume, uh,
House is a great doctor.

499
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:35,484
Why would you assume that?

500
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:39,432
Because, uh,
when you're that big a jerk,
you're either great or unemployed.

501
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:45,685
No sign of gall bladder infection.
But there was a cyst.

502
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:47,796
Perfectly round.
Now, hep C wouldn't cause--

503
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:49,552
The question was never,
is it hep C?

504
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:52,471
The question was given
that it's not hep C, what is it?

505
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,613
- Adenoma?
- Not solid enough.

506
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:56,170
Cavernous hemangioma?

507
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:58,506
Not vascular enough.

508
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:02,916
What if she was sloppy about
washing her hands after pooping?

509
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,034
Uh...amoeba infection?

510
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:09,823
If the amebiasis started in her liver,
then spread to her blood,
that would explain all her symptoms.

511
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:12,803
Except for the crushed skull, but
I'm assuming that's from the car crash.

512
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:14,839
I'll start her on
paromomycin and chloroquine.

513
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,141
Ten grams each.

514
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:19,303
That's...20 times
the normal dose.

515
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:22,835
Right. So we'll destroy
her retinas and damage her hearing.

516
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,572
Whoever wants those parts
is having a very bad day.

517
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,358
Couple hours on the meds,
she'll be feeling great.

518
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:36,774
Got your labs.

519
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:39,272
- Do you eat guinea pigs?
- No.

520
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:42,117
How about hamsters or mice?

521
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:43,325
Humans?

522
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,767
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:46,471
Is something wrong with me?

524
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:48,172
Absolutely nothing.

525
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,033
Your blood work is perfect.

526
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:54,035
You've got lots of vitamins,
minerals. All kinds of proteins.

527
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:59,076
Including a little something
I like to call bovine serum albumin.

528
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,129
Which you get from eating
the animals mentioned.

529
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,260
Or cow.

530
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:08,181
You don't really worship cows.

531
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,447
So I have to wonder,

532
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:15,330
what could be more humiliating than
someone calling your girlfriend a cow
and not being metaphorical?

533
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:32,820
- Nice.
- It's my mom.

534
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:38,655
Well, either that's
a very old photograph,
or it's your stepmom.

535
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,733
She goes around the house
in a bikini. Or less.

536
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:43,583
I-I can't stop
thinking about her.

537
00:30:43,727 --> 00:30:47,847
My dad's in Europe.
I'll be watching TV,
she'll give me a massage.

538
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,157
I can't walk for an hour.

539
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:52,804
- Still. Cows?
- She's my mother!

540
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:54,031
Step.

541
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:57,063
Please.

542
00:30:57,214 --> 00:31:00,772
I just need the medicine
for three months until I graduate
and I move out of the house.

543
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,100
Please.

544
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:09,862
You're not gonna have
any fun at graduation.

545
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:14,190
Keep up the good work.

546
00:31:14,493 --> 00:31:16,280
Your shirt is ironed.

547
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,811
That means you haven't
told your wife anything.

548
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,281
Let's say you're right.

549
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,850
You're saying I'm right?

550
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,931
No. Let is saying.

551
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:32,570
Does it occur to you that maybe
there's some deeper guidance
than "keep your mouth shut"?

552
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:37,991
That maybe a friend might value
concern over glibness? That maybe...

553
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:45,343
Maybe I'm going through
something that I need to have
an actual conversation about?

554
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:49,487
[Hosue's beeper goes off]

555
00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:57,546
Does it occur to you that
if you need that kind of a friend,
you may have made some deeper errors.

556
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,407
Chase:
Her heartbeat's irregular.

557
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,905
Looks like global hypokinesis.

558
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:16,985
Stop the meds.

559
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:20,404
You're giving up?

560
00:32:20,528 --> 00:32:23,323
Either we're wrong
and her heart is unusable...

561
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:27,493
or right, but the treatment
we had to give her will
make her heart unusable.

562
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:32,345
I'm sorry.
You can pull the plug now.

563
00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:33,878
Find me another body.

564
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:36,205
That fat guy on Ortho service
didn't look so hot.

565
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:37,579
No!

566
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,149
She's not ready.

567
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:43,486
You were ready this morning.

568
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,137
She's not done.

569
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,966
She's gotta save that guy.

570
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,071
House:
Alternate theories?

571
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,851
Amebiasis was our best hope.

572
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:08,031
The fact that her heart rate
went back to normal when
we stopped the meds pretty much--

573
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:09,828
What's our second best hope?

574
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:11,524
House, put down the wand.

575
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:13,119
There's no obstruction.

576
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:15,663
Maybe we should just biopsy it.

577
00:33:15,722 --> 00:33:18,155
She's a fridge
with the power out.

578
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:21,937
We start poking around inside,
the vegetable goes bad.

579
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:24,866
No offense.

580
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:26,670
I don't see that
we have a lot of choice.

581
00:33:26,736 --> 00:33:28,155
The only way we're
gonna find that infection--

582
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,431
Cameron:
What if it's not an infection?

583
00:33:29,494 --> 00:33:33,293
Toxins can cause similar symptoms.
Especially if whatever it is did liver damage.

584
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:35,602
Her, uh, toxin screen was clean.

585
00:33:35,664 --> 00:33:38,769
Those things never cover
for any of the really cool toxins.

586
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,760
Run the screen again
for whatever you can think of.

587
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:43,966
You, keep the other patient alive.

588
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:45,792
You, check out the school.

589
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:49,612
And I seem to need
o hire another doctor
to go search her home.

590
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:52,944
Come on.

591
00:33:56,103 --> 00:33:58,945
If she was taking
any medications,
I'd know about it.

592
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:03,336
Did your wife dye her hair?

593
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:04,737
No.

594
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:06,714
Her mom never went gray.

595
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:07,757
She didn't either.

596
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,967
Guess this must be yours, then.

597
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,972
Can you think of anything else
she might've lied to you about?

598
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:16,590
Any drugs she "gave up"
when she married you?

599
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:29,439
How are you feeling, sir?

600
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,369
Mr. Arrington?

601
00:34:31,663 --> 00:34:32,953
Mr. Arrington?

602
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:34,661
[Monitor starts beeping]

603
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:36,870
What's going on?

604
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,971
His heart's not pumping
enough blood to his brain.

605
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:40,665
We're gonna have to
give it some help.

606
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:42,728
Get the balloon ready.

607
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:49,309
You use this drawer?

608
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,800
Neuberger:
No, that's for her vitamins.

609
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,139
And sleeping pills.

610
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:56,378
She never took sleeping pills.

611
00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:57,972
Okay.

612
00:35:00,313 --> 00:35:01,880
You on a diet?

613
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:03,487
No.

614
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:12,125
I guess you never really
know someone, do you?

615
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:15,092
Quite the insight.

616
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,417
She lied to you
about her hair color.

617
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:20,357
And didn't want you to know
she thought she was fat.

618
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:24,089
Unless you never lied to her
about anything that huge.

619
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:26,780
And then you can
probably let those slide.

620
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,069
Diet pills could've
messed her up.

621
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,534
Raised the live enzymes
and caused the bellyache.

622
00:35:33,641 --> 00:35:35,117
But not the fever.

623
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:37,229
Maybe something else
set off the fever.

624
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:38,641
Like what?

625
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:41,069
Before I show you these,
they were in a locked drawer
in her desk.

626
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:44,532
The vice principal said that
Laura must've confiscated them.
They've had some problems with--

627
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:46,753
Neither interesting nor helpful.

628
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:50,995
This at least is interesting.

629
00:35:51,965 --> 00:35:53,375
[Scoffs]
No, it's not.

630
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:56,345
Sex with teenagers
isn't interesting?
Where did you grow up?

631
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:59,500
It isn't helpful.
Teenage boys aren't toxins.

632
00:36:00,387 --> 00:36:03,139
What if the cyst isn't a cyst?

633
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:05,639
Then we have nothing to go on.

634
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:08,302
I said it's not a cyst.
I didn't say it was nothing.

635
00:36:08,444 --> 00:36:09,668
What if it's a scar?

636
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:11,499
Foreman:
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome?

637
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,529
You're pushing gonorrhea again?

638
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,327
You got anything better?

639
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:18,698
Test her.
And start her on ceftriaxone.

640
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:33,469
What are you testing for now?

641
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:37,570
Just some more infections.

642
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:53,603
She's positive for gonorrhea.

643
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,503
I think that's the first time
those words have been uttered in joy.

644
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:00,646
Meds are started.

645
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:02,880
Her heart should be clear enough
to use in about four or five hours.

646
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:04,591
I'll go tell the families.

647
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:05,945
He's in a coma.

648
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:07,597
Start him on dobutamine.

649
00:37:07,656 --> 00:37:08,915
Already did.

650
00:37:09,414 --> 00:37:13,003
We either do the surgery now
or we find him a new brain too.

651
00:37:13,675 --> 00:37:17,022
House, she's still got
a significant amount of
gonorrhea in her system.

652
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,251
Hopefully tomorrow,
it'll be in his system.

653
00:37:22,286 --> 00:37:25,161
I need two O.R.s
and the transplant team.

654
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:30,256
What is it?

655
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,032
Amy:
What's going on?

656
00:37:39,225 --> 00:37:41,285
- Is he getting a heart?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

657
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,624
I assume this means
you, uh, you found out
what was wrong with Laura?

658
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,967
She had a amebiasis.

659
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:07,798
We just found a different way
to get rid of it.

660
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:11,491
Thank you.

661
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:17,541
That was kind of you.

662
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,062
I didn't want him
going postal on us.

663
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:23,882
Soon as his wife's heart's in our hands,
you can tell him about the gonorrhea.

664
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:26,778
He's gotta be tested.

665
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:29,938
Preferably before he gets
any sympathy sex.

666
00:39:03,351 --> 00:39:04,666
Paddles.

667
00:39:09,946 --> 00:39:11,411
50 joules.

668
00:39:15,393 --> 00:39:16,767
Charging.

669
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,026
Charging.

670
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:30,867
[Heart begins to beat]

671
00:39:31,515 --> 00:39:33,560
Let's take him off bypass.

672
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:56,036
Mr. Neuberger.
There's something
I need to tell you.

673
00:39:57,904 --> 00:39:59,787
The last, uh...

674
00:40:00,802 --> 00:40:04,188
year or so, uh...

675
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,367
Laura was kind of
distant with me.

676
00:40:07,553 --> 00:40:09,169
I don't know why.

677
00:40:09,778 --> 00:40:13,016
I thought maybe
she was having an affair.

678
00:40:13,164 --> 00:40:16,664
But...not Laura.
And I'm not excusing myself,

679
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,315
but when I was traveling
during Christmas, I had a...

680
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:23,901
I had a one-night stand.

681
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:25,715
I got gonorrhea.

682
00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:31,025
- Are you sure--
- Yeah.

683
00:40:32,286 --> 00:40:34,348
I should've said
something to you.

684
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:37,461
But I didn't want to believe
that I gave it to her.

685
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,102
That's what made her sick,and...

686
00:40:39,216 --> 00:40:42,730
that was why she got
into the accident.

687
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:06,693
Cecile?

688
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:09,083
Am I dead?

689
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,376
Hopefully not for a long time.

690
00:41:12,582 --> 00:41:14,141
Why are you here?

691
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:16,003
Amy called me.

692
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:20,347
If you do Mom again,
you gotta wear a condom.

693
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:23,561
You're gonna have gonorrhea
in your system for a while.

"Honky Tonk Women"  by Taj Mahal

695
00:41:33,422 --> 00:41:40,720
<i># I met a gin-soaked
barroom queen in Memphis #</i>

696
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,985
[Knock on the door]

697
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:51,111
<i># She tried to take me
upstairs for a ride #</i>

698
00:41:53,843 --> 00:42:01,227
<i># She had to heave me
right across her shoulder #</i>

699
00:42:03,244 --> 00:42:04,765
<i># 'Cause I just can't... #</i>

700
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:07,065
Could I stay with you
for a few days?

701
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,835
You idiot.

702
00:42:09,954 --> 00:42:11,085
You told her.

703
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,025
She told me.

704
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:16,911
Things have been
crappy at home lately.

705
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:19,197
I figured I wasn't
spending enough time there.

706
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:21,063
I figured...

707
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:26,960
It turns out, you're right.

708
00:42:27,124 --> 00:42:29,269
It's always about sex.

709
00:42:30,855 --> 00:42:33,174
She's been having an affair.

710
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:40,575
<i># It's the honky-tonk women #</i>

711
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,349
Want a beer?

712
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:49,782
<i># That gimme, gimme, gimme
the honky-tonk blues  #</i>
