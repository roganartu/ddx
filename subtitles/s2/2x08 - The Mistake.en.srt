1
00:00:01,675 --> 00:00:04,330
Welcome! I'm here for illuding!

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,001
What is *** and what is magic?

3
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:10,654
This is what you've wanted.

4
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:12,943
Now I will astound you!

5
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:15,841
As you see there's
nothing up my sleeves.

6
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:18,374
And this hat...
just an ordinary old hat.

7
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:21,733
Watch as I wave
three times above the hat,

8
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:25,639
and whisper the magic words.
And now...

9
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:28,496
[Laughter and aplause]

10
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:31,128
Mom it's not working!
It's ripped!

11
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:32,898
It's okay baby,
it's just a little tear.

12
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,229
Hurry up, mom!

13
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:35,768
What are you so worried about?

14
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:37,643
Sally's going to make fun of us.

15
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,282
Sally Ayerson?

16
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:41,501
She said her mom bought
her dress at Bloomingdales.

17
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:43,342
You had to make ours.

18
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:45,513
We're going to look stupid!

19
00:00:46,487 --> 00:00:49,164
Do you girls remember that music
we were listening to yesterday?

20
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:50,787
That lady who sang about respect?

21
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:51,602
Retha?

22
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:53,251
Aretha. That's right.

23
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,497
Do you think she had lots of money
growing up in Detroit?

24
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:56,708
What's Detroit?

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,188
It's a city. The point is that
she's one of the best singers ever.

26
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:05,941
If Sally's mean to you again
I'm just going to have to
key her daddy's new convertible.

27
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:09,364
Do you know what that means?

28
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:11,330
Good.

29
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:14,001
Piano intro for
"Little Bitty Pretty One"

30
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:16,980
<i># Mmmm m m mm #</i>

31
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:19,962
<i># Mmmm m m mm #</i>

32
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:22,974
<i># Mmmm m m mm #</i>

33
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:26,373
<i># Mmmm m m mm #</i>

34
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,242
<i># Wow wow wo wo wow #</i>

35
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:32,136
<i># Wow wow wo wo wow #</i>

36
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,779
<i># Little bitty pretty one #</i>

37
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,624
<i># Come on and talk to me #</i>

38
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:41,056
<i># Lovey dovey dovey one #</i>

39
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:43,938
<i># Come and sit down on my knee #</i>

40
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,792
<i># Wow wow wo wo wow #</i>

41
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:49,296
Ahhh!
[Starts crying out in pain]

42
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,919
YeeeAhhhh!

43
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:59,421
Ahhhhhhh!

44
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:04,564
2x08 - The Mistake

45
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:29,639
Original Airdate (FOX): 29-NOV-2005

46
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:33,663
<i>[Overhead speaker is calling for Dr. Lau]
"Dr. Lau, 2826. Dr. Lau, 2826."</i>

47
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,706
- Hey.
- Hey.

48
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,161
Did you speak to
Chase and House yet?
The disciplinary hearing.

49
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:40,995
The McGinley case.
That's not for two weeks.

50
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,034
Tomorrow.
Scheduling disaster,
you don't want to hear it.

51
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:45,710
You gotta get the boys okay
to move the hearing up,

52
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,904
and you gotta do that
whole legal advice thing.

53
00:02:47,988 --> 00:02:50,198
- Will you ask someone else?
- I'm asking you.

54
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:53,993
Let me work with Chase.
House should have separate counsel.

55
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:55,724
Stop looking for
whatever you're looking for.

56
00:02:55,808 --> 00:03:00,844
For the last month, House has been
crowing that you can't work with him
because you're just swooning in love.

57
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:04,078
There is nothing approaching love
in what I feel about him right now.

58
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:07,235
Well if you can't work with him,
it amounts to the same thing.

59
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,410
[Sighs]
We had a fight. It's awkward.
Why not use another lawyer?

60
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:14,405
Because 40% of our lawsuits
last year were about House.

61
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:16,859
You can't work with him,
you can't work here.

62
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:20,077
House:
She's over-reacting.

63
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:23,758
Wilson:
You snuck into her shrink's office
and read her private file.

64
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:25,932
When Nixon did that,
he got impeached.

65
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:29,755
So you're saying
I'm not allowed to have oral sex
with an intern either?

66
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:32,702
- Yes!
- And yes.

67
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:36,686
The file got me
on the floor of her attic
with her pouring out her soul.

68
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:39,282
The only thing I did wrong
was get caught.

69
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:42,489
Stacy:
Where's Chase?

70
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,434
He's too busy to service you
until after work.

71
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:48,238
House:
I got a couple of minutes though.

72
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,203
Feel free to
say something like

73
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,517
"what'll we do with
the time left over?"

74
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:55,391
Or you could just stew.
That works as well.

75
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:57,086
She stews
before she gets violent.

76
00:03:57,235 --> 00:04:00,221
This one says you're okay with
moving the disciplinary hearing
to tomorrow.

77
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,451
This one says I've advised you
of your legal rights.

78
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:05,609
Uh huh, any legal rights
I should know about?

79
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:07,634
Nope.
[Tosses her pen on to the table]

80
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,962
Great.

81
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,899
And you thought
this was going to be awkward.

82
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:14,282
You shouldn't sign it.

83
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:18,548
Postponing is almost always
the smart thing to do.
Tempers cool, memories fade.

84
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:21,914
- They rule on me it's done, right?
- Yeah, but...

85
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:23,462
Then let's get it over with.

86
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:26,006
- Have you ever done
a peer review before?
- No.

87
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:27,510
Good.

88
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,293
Here's a misnomer,
these are your bosses.

89
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:33,245
This will cost you
some money, some privileges,

90
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:35,610
or it could cost you your career.

91
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,753
All I can tell them is what happened.

92
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:41,817
There's an objective reality
to what happened and that
committee is never going to know it.

93
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:44,042
All they're going to know is
what they picture happened,

94
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:47,636
which depends a little
on what you tell them,
and a whole lot...

95
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,612
on HOW you tell them.

96
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:52,110
May 11th.

97
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:55,623
- Patient presented to the clinic...
- What's her name?

98
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,734
- It's in the file.
- Do you know it?

99
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,646
Then use it.

100
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,863
Kayla presented to the clinic
with multiple joint and stomach pain.

101
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:07,964
Chase:
Dr. Foreman was called in
for a neurological consult.

102
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:09,531
<i>Sam:
What's the point of this, man?</i>

103
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:11,690
<i>Checking your sister's
cerebral coordination.</i>

104
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:14,325
<i>The thing is in her leg
and her stomach.</i>

105
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,569
<i>Wait in the clinic for six hours
so she can play patty cake?</i>

106
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,787
<i>She could have gone
to the ER last night.</i>

107
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,059
<i>Oh yeah?
You wanna come over
and babysit her kids?</i>

108
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:26,271
Stacy:
Ok, patient comes from
a family of jerks, I get it.

109
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:27,789
Can you stick to the medicine?

110
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,116
<i>Something wrong?</i>

111
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:31,829
Chase:
There was some uveitis.

112
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:32,870
Stacy:
Meaning?

113
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:35,974
Her iris?
The colour part of her eye
was inflamed.

114
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:36,947
Meaning?

115
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:38,903
Worst case, blindness.

116
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:41,021
But there was an upside.

117
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,706
It was weird enough
to get House interested.

118
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,965
<i>Young woman, joint pain.
Gonorrhea is a possibility.</i>

119
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:49,466
<i>It's probably articular.
Maybe rheumatoid.</i>

120
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:51,596
<i>It's typically small joints,
it's her knee.</i>

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,445
<i>Takayasu's arthritis.</i>

122
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:57,285
<i>Get a sed rate
and serologies.</i>

123
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:59,928
<i>Child proof.</i>

124
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,278
<i>How many kids are
hopped up on vicodin?</i>

125
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,032
<i>Gimme.</i>

126
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:03,887
<i>Right.</i>

127
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:05,701
<i>Like I'd ever get it back.</i>

128
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,016
<i>Chase.</i>

129
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,924
Stacy:
Don't care about the vicodin.

130
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:09,550
<i>[Pop!]</i>

131
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:12,531
<i>Might not just be her arteries,
could be all her blood vessels.</i>

132
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:15,479
<i>Vasculitis,
with stomach pain,
so... Bichette's.</i>

133
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:16,979
<i>No, she'd have oral sores.</i>

134
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:18,367
<i>Or genital.</i>

135
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:20,283
<i>Go find them.</i>

136
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,866
I thought
she was Foreman's patient,
why did you do the exam?

137
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:27,309
<i>Foreman:
She'd have oral sores.</i>

138
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:30,163
<i>House:
Or genital. Go find them.</i>

139
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:40,879
<i>Woah woah Foreman...
Chase can handle the pelvic.</i>

140
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:43,787
<i>Any pain?</i>

141
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:46,480
<i>Is it bad?</i>

142
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,350
<i>This will go a little easier
if you talk to me.</i>

143
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,932
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

144
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:58,025
<i>I umm...
I just really hate hospitals.</i>

145
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,759
<i>When I was 12,
had my tonsils out.</i>

146
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,797
<i>Got to skip school,
lots of ice cream,
made me want to be a doctor.</i>

147
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,523
<i>My mom... died
when I was 8 so...</i>

148
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:11,402
<i>I spent months
at Princeton General.</i>

149
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,694
<i>She died of TT's?
Your mom?</i>

150
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:20,143
<i>Bottles stashed around the house?
Mood swings? That whole deal?</i>

151
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:21,288
<i>You've been there?</i>

152
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:25,928
<i>My mom. Dad left,
mom crawled inside a bottle.</i>

153
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,139
<i>Made for a great Year 12
of high school.</i>

154
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:31,376
<i>You ok with your dad now?</i>

155
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,109
<i>No.</i>

156
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,481
Does your dad have
anything to do with this story?

157
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:38,412
No, it's just...

158
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,573
Okay, I get it,
the two of you bonded, which is why
you probably haven't been sued.

159
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:44,866
Patients never sue doctors they like. But keep it brief, ok?

160
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,573
The panel doesn't like to think
they're being manipulated
when they're being manipulated.

161
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,772
She had some ulceration.

162
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:52,274
Confirming Bichette's?

163
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:55,251
I gave her some
prednisone, an antacid

164
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:58,939
and I ran a pathogy test on her arm,
takes 24 hours to confirm.

165
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,958
Told her any doctor could check it out.

166
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,332
You didn't make an appointment?

167
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:04,499
Nope. She just showed up.

168
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,718
<i>[On the phone]
Uh huh.</i>

169
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:08,376
<i>Dr. Chase.</i>

170
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,850
<i>Hi.</i>

171
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:12,771
<i>All right, let's take a look.</i>

172
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:18,477
<i>Okay, those little pustules
means it's positive.</i>

173
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:22,268
<i>Talk to Nurse Previn,
get an appointment with
Dr. Broston in rheumatology.</i>

174
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:25,355
<i>Bichette's is very treatable. You're going to be fine.</i>

175
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,072
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

176
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,293
And you were just chatting
on the phone to someone and
she just happened to run into you.

177
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:33,404
That's what happened.

178
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:35,742
No appointment?
No real examination?

179
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:37,478
Just gave her the test results.

180
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:42,511
So, lower standard of care,
you really couldn't be expected to
notice there was anything else wrong.

181
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,002
We didn't even go
into an exam room.

182
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:50,975
As your lawyer,

183
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,778
I can't stop you from lying,
I can't even be in the room,

184
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:56,709
but I would be remiss
if I didn't prep you until I'm better.

185
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:02,019
You wrote her a prescription,
which means there was an examination.

186
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:03,948
What really happened?

187
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,827
I was on the phone.

188
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:10,410
<i>Dr. Chase?</i>

189
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:12,174
<i>Hi.</i>

190
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,499
<i>Hi.</i>

191
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:16,621
<i>Kayla. I'm here
for the test... my arm?</i>

192
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:20,535
<i>Oh. Oh yeah... umm, okay.</i>

193
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:26,587
<i>It's positive. Talk to Nurse Previn,
get an appointment with
Dr. Broston in rheumatology.</i>

194
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:31,149
<i>I took that medicine
you gave me,  but
my stomach still hurts.</i>

195
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:38,684
<i>Bichette's can be stronger
than we thought, or it could be
reflux from the prednisone.</i>

196
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:42,698
<i>This is a stronger antacid.</i>

197
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:43,814
<i>Doctor...</i>

198
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:45,187
<i>Yes?</i>

199
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,363
<i>Nothing.</i>

200
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,523
You didn't ask her anything
about the stomach pain?

201
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:57,218
I made one little mistake.

202
00:09:57,624 --> 00:10:00,447
As little mistakes go,
that was a biggie.

203
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,895
She's only advising Chase?
Not you?

204
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,788
Well what's the committee
going to do to me?

205
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:09,173
I haven't even met this patient.

206
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:13,346
Your disdain for human interaction
doesn't exculpate you, it inculpates you.

207
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,837
Besides the charts,
you're responsible for
everything Chase does.

208
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:17,009
Which is why
this doesn't matter.

209
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:19,026
She protects Chase,
she protects me.

210
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,822
Unless her advice to Chase is
to make a deal and give you up.

211
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:26,931
[Poorly mimics Chase]
"I'm so sorry, if only
Dr. House had paid attention,

212
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,050
he'd never even met her,
he never does."

213
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:32,987
Chase loves me.
And isn't Turkish.

214
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:35,517
Cameron loves you.
Chase loves his job.

215
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,790
You really think
Stacy hates me that much?

216
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:40,926
I think right now
she hates you
more than enough.

217
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,267
You think
emotion only affects
doctor's judgments?

218
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:51,953
Everything stems
from that one interaction,
they're going to slam you on it.

219
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:53,523
Were you distracted,
your problem.

220
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:55,255
Overworked,
that's their problem.

221
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:56,694
Forgetful, yours, lazy...

222
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:58,549
I just figured
the stomach pain
was the Bichette's.

223
00:10:58,633 --> 00:10:59,855
Any doctor would have
thought the same.

224
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,438
Then why did you call her
an hour after she left the clinic?

225
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:06,159
Nurse Previn said you asked her
to have Kayla come back in.

226
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:09,971
The way she hesitated
I thought she might have
had a doorknob question.

227
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,343
Patient comes in,
says he's got a sniffly nose,
you examine him for 10 minutes right?

228
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:20,327
Then you're leaving,
hand on the doorknob, and he says
"oh yeah and my penis has turned green".

229
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,225
Embarrassing question,
only important when
patient saves it for last,

230
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:26,339
so you knew
she was about to ask
the most important question...

231
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,789
and you left.

232
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:30,894
No. I didn't.
I figured it out later.

233
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:32,173
What changed?

234
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:33,627
Nothing.

235
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,411
Bad answer.

236
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:36,279
I wasn't thinking clearly at first.

237
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,838
Worst answer.

238
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:40,053
What was her doorknob question?

239
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,655
I figured it might be
blood in her stool,

240
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:45,667
which could indicate
a bleeding ulcer.

241
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:46,597
<i>Talk to me.</i>

242
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:48,977
<i>35-yr-old female vomiting
massive amounts of blood.</i>

243
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:52,151
<i>LOC at work,
BP 80 over 20, heart rate 140.</i>

244
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:53,082
<i>Push flows?</i>

245
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:55,793
<i>3 litres in the field,
and we're boosting
another one right now.</i>

246
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,345
<i>It's gotta be a bleeding ulcer, doc.</i>

247
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:59,977
<i>Co-worker says that she's been
eating ibuprofens like candy.</i>

248
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,496
<i>I thought she had Bichette's.</i>

249
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,485
<i>1, 2, 3.</i>

250
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:24,277
<i>Chase:
I'm in her stomach.
There's too much blood, I can't see.</i>

251
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,599
<i>She burst an artery?</i>

252
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:30,120
<i>No, there.
Bubbling, just a bad ulcer.
Cauterizing.</i>

253
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:32,298
<i>- Can't see, use more saline.
- Hold on!</i>

254
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:33,816
<i>Okay.</i>

255
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,600
<i>[Sighs] Looks good.</i>

256
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:40,464
<i>Bleeding ulcer. We got it.
She was fine 2 hours ago.</i>

257
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:42,349
<i>[Alarms start beeping]
Systolic BP's 70.</i>

258
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:43,422
<i>House:
Where's the ulcer?</i>

259
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:46,321
<i>It's brown. I cauterized it.
It must be something else.</i>

260
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,243
<i>Chase: There.
Foreman: Second ulcer?</i>

261
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,922
<i>Not anymore.
It perforated.</i>

262
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:52,995
<i>Get her to an OR!</i>

263
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,837
The surgeons were able to
suture the perforation.

264
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:58,503
But the contents
of the patient's ...

265
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:02,400
Kayla's stomach had
spilled into her body.

266
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,513
She got septic.

267
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:05,665
Then the infection
lowers her blood pressure...

268
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,467
50 over *** at one point.

269
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:09,710
It damaged
her liver and kidneys.

270
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:17,575
Listen, I know this looks bad,
I obviously got the diagnosis wrong
but I did everything by the book.

271
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,801
I couldn't have known
what was going to happen.

272
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:24,514
If I skip my coffee I get cranky.
Do you want anything?

273
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,471
Why did Chase screw up?

274
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:39,427
He forgot to ask her a question,
does there need to be a reason?

275
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,930
It might help him.

276
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,069
As far as I'm concerned,
he made a little mistake. It happens.

277
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:45,579
How far are you concerned?

278
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:47,027
You think I'm biased?

279
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,300
You're colleagues.
You've worked together
for over a year.

280
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,564
And everyone says
you slept together.

281
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:54,298
[Clears her throat]
Who says?

282
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,135
The correct answer is
"we're not involved
and I'm not biased".

283
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,940
We're not involved.
And I don't know
why he messed up.

284
00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:03,106
House has worked with him
longer than I have.

285
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:04,966
You should talk to House.

286
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:09,832
Yeah.
Why did Chase screw up?

287
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:12,650
Because he doesn't
give a crap about patients.

288
00:14:12,712 --> 00:14:14,709
Well he always gets
positive patient reviews.

289
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:18,543
Yeah.
He smiles all 84 of his teeth,
tells them his tonsil story.

290
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,553
It's a nice story.

291
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:21,178
He still has his tonsils.

292
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,575
As soon as
he's out of the room,

293
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:26,234
which is as soon as
he can be out of the room,
he starts in on the trash talk.

294
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:30,982
Thinks not giving a crap
makes him like House.
Like something to aspire to.

295
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:33,517
Am I going to have to testify?

296
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:36,287
I won't be
encouraging them to call you.

297
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:37,858
What'd House say?

298
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:43,082
[Coughing]

299
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:44,990
Two months like this.

300
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:49,189
Let me guess, no insurance.
Just heard about the free clinic.

301
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,262
It's a good move.

302
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:54,982
You don't want to skimp
on the essentials like
wristwatches, MP3 players.

303
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:56,977
I need to talk to you.

304
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:58,484
From the doorway?

305
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:01,801
- It's confidential.
- Cool. I love gossip.

306
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:07,627
Hear that crackling sound
like crumpling up paper?

307
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:10,482
Keep listening.
Let me know if it changes.

308
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:24,101
Two questions.
Why did Chase screw up
and how bad was it?

309
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:26,202
Wow. Talk about efficient.

310
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:28,511
I only need one answer,
Chase didn't screw up.

311
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,670
He said he did.

312
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:32,815
Well I'm not a lawyer,
but that seems like
a sucky legal strategy.

313
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,177
Look I don't wanna know
what you think a reasonable doctor
would have done in Chase's position.

314
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:39,053
If I thought
he was a 'reasonable' doctor,
I wouldn't have hired him.

315
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,700
God, you two are
a couple of geniuses.

316
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:43,937
Deny everything,
completely fool the lawyer
who's trying to help you.

317
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,710
Too bad the review committee
members are actually doctors.

318
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:49,376
Stacy.

319
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:53,011
[Sighs]

320
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:56,417
<i>I'm in her stomach.
There's too much blood,
I can't see.</i>

321
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:57,466
<i>She burst an artery?</i>

322
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,341
<i>No. There.
Bubbling, just a bad ulcer.</i>

323
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:05,719
<i>Okay, cauterizing.
Looks good.</i>

324
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:09,600
<i>Bleeding ulcer, we've got it.
She was fine 2 hours ago.</i>

325
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:15,419
<i>If by fine, you mean she had fountains
of blood spurting out of every orifice
then yeah, I believe you.</i>

326
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:16,775
<i>[Alarms start beeping]</i>

327
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:19,013
<i>I'm guessing
those are salvatory bells.</i>

328
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:20,572
<i>Systolic BP's 70.</i>

329
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,622
<i>Show me the ulcer.</i>

330
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:22,893
<i>It's brown.
I cauterized it.</i>

331
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:24,945
<i>Sweep back, show me
the whole stomach.</i>

332
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:28,530
<i>Stop.</i>

333
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:30,112
<i>Foreman:
Second ulcer?</i>

334
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:32,671
<i>Not anymore.
It perforated.</i>

335
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,649
<i>Get her to an OR!</i>

336
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:36,554
<i>Let's go.</i>

337
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,089
<i>She was not fine
2 hours ago.</i>

338
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:43,550
<i>She mentioned
stomach pain?</i>

339
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:44,899
<i>Yeah, so I gave her a stronger...</i>

340
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:45,951
<i>You didn't do an exam.</i>

341
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:49,455
<i>She just came in for a follow-up.
The results of the pathogen test.</i>

342
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,059
<i>Did you listen to her stomach?
Check her vitals?</i>

343
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:55,983
<i>Maybe if she'd said something
about taking ibuprofen,
mentioned the rectal bleeding!</i>

344
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,945
<i>Yeah, why didn't she go to
med school like you did?!</i>

345
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:01,902
<i>Diarrhoea! Blood in the stool!
These are routine questions...</i>

346
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:03,729
<i>Doctors skip all the time!</i>

347
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:05,706
<i>It was a minor mistake;
I couldn't have known
it was going to happen...</i>

348
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,958
<i>Mistakes are as serious
as the results they cause!</i>

349
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:11,139
<i>This woman could die
because you were too lazy
to ask one simple question!</i>

350
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:14,911
<i>No! She might die
because I had the bad luck
to spill your damn vicodin pills!</i>

351
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:16,932
And I responded
with a number of

352
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:21,004
trenchant remarks which
made Chase cry, none of which
I'm going to testify about.

353
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:23,492
Unless you convince
Chase to row on me.

354
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:27,754
Excuse me,
testify about what?

355
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,649
Uhh...

356
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:32,331
Chuck.

357
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:36,778
I'm going to break from
the parable of the wicked doctor
and tell a little story about a patient.

358
00:17:36,862 --> 00:17:38,262
Let's call him...

359
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:42,481
Buck, who has low O2 stats
and crackling lung sounds.

360
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:43,531
Like I have?

361
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:46,919
Buck has idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis.

362
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:49,170
His lung tissue's turning to rock.

363
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:53,237
There's no known cause,
no treatment.
He is slowly suffocating.

364
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:54,445
You're talking about me?

365
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:57,052
Lung transplant's
about a half a million dollars,

366
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:58,712
but this poor sucker's
got no insurance.

367
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,095
If he tried to sign up now,
he'd be excluded,
pre-existing condition.

368
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:03,982
But let me confirm
with my lawyer.

369
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,568
She confirms.

370
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:11,456
If only Buck hadn't been
diagnosed with fibrosis
before he got insurance.

371
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:14,312
So... back to the exam.

372
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:27,416
That's how you tell
this guy he's dying?

373
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,817
Oh relax. He's got a cold,
and soon, health insurance.

374
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,071
Such a hero.
Always righting wrongs.

375
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:37,137
Who cares
who you have to manipulate.

376
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:41,487
I'm sorry. I didn't realise
you and Buck were so close.

377
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,064
Stacy:
It's a point of principle.

378
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:48,559
Right. It's got nothing to do
with what I did to you.

379
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:50,318
There's nothing
for us to talk about.

380
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,111
That's why you're following me.
I read some notes...

381
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:53,993
If Chase screwed up...

382
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:57,456
I was wrong.
Terribly, terribly sorry.

383
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,858
If Chase screwed up so badly,
why didn't you fire him?

384
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:01,252
He has great hair.

385
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:03,759
What are you hiding?

386
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,075
I'm gay.

387
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,980
Oh, that's not what you meant.

388
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:08,882
It does explain a lot though.

389
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,375
No girlfriend,
always with Wilson,
obsession with sneakers...

390
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,677
Diarrhoea, blood in the stool.

391
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:19,924
Two simple questions you could
have asked her six months ago
and averted this whole thing.

392
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:22,473
You didn't ask either, why?

393
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,442
Judging from your question,
and your demeanour,

394
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,888
I assume you were
visiting with House.

395
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:31,539
Been over this.
I don't know.

396
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:34,462
- Good doctors don't make mistakes...
- Good doctors never forget to ask questions?

397
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,924
Then you've got your answer,
apparently I'm not a good doctor!

398
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,964
FYI, self-pity generally is not
a good strategy in these hearings.

399
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:42,099
What happened
after the operation?

400
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,284
<i>The kidney damage
isn't so bad.</i>

401
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,447
<i>The liver damage is
more worrisome.</i>

402
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:49,288
<i>There's no dialysis for livers.</i>

403
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:52,703
<i>I know, but if she loses her liver
she can get a transplant, right?</i>

404
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:54,884
<i>We can put her on a list.</i>

405
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,142
<i>I could do it.</i>

406
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,913
<i>I could give her part of my liver.</i>

407
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,925
<i>Surgeons won't operate
unless the donor's had
a long time to weigh the decision.</i>

408
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:04,547
<i>There's black markets.</i>

409
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,342
<i>Those organs...
That's just...</i>

410
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:09,539
<i>Ooh... ohhh my stomach!
[Alarms start beeping]</i>

411
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:11,532
<i>- Are they constant?
- Ohh... oh yeah!</i>

412
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:13,912
<i>- Sharp or dull?
- Oh I don't know!</i>

413
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:14,810
<i>It's bad.</i>

414
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:16,982
<i>It's a little cold.</i>

415
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,744
<i>- Appendicitis?
- No, it's a clot.</i>

416
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:22,539
<i>Nurse! Call the OR,
we've got to prep her
for an embolectomy.</i>

417
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:24,164
<i>Oh, ohhh!</i>

418
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,351
<i>A CVC, PT and a liver panel.</i>

419
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:31,128
Sepsis had lowered her BP so much
she got clots in her liver.

420
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:35,061
They blocked the hepatic artery,
cut off the blood flow.
Her liver was shocked.

421
00:20:35,145 --> 00:20:37,732
Did Cuddy list her though?
With all the other problems?

422
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:43,055
<i>Forget it. We can't give
a liver to a woman this sick.</i>

423
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:44,401
<i>Do you listen to
what you're saying?</i>

424
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:48,406
<i>There is no point in
giving a new liver to somebody
who also has vasculitis.</i>

425
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,275
<i>Treatable.</i>

426
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,620
<i>And kidney damage.</i>

427
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:51,432
<i>It's healing.</i>

428
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,471
<i>You know what's
really killing her?</i>

429
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,622
<i>Chase forgot to ask a standard
question about stomach pain,</i>

430
00:20:56,706 --> 00:21:00,217
<i>so he missed the diagnosis,
so she perforated,
so she got sepsis,</i>

431
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,781
<i>so her BP tanks,
so she got blood clots,
so she lost her liver.</i>

432
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:07,574
<i>Livers are important, Cuddy.
Can't live without them,
hence the name.</i>

433
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:10,775
<i>And here's the big issue,
Chase is a hospital employee,</i>

434
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:16,013
<i>and Kayla is the sympathetic
mother of those 2 jury-friendly
moppets Kayleb and Cody.</i>

435
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,304
<i>Dory and Nicky.</i>

436
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:25,383
<i>Your point, beyond just trying to
make Chase wet himself seems to be
that the hospital faces liability here.</i>

437
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:29,504
<i>Well thanks for clearing that up.
I still need a medical reason to list her.</i>

438
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,037
<i>That is a medical reason!</i>

439
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:35,336
<i>The family wins
this hospital in a lawsuit,
they'll turn it into condos.</i>

440
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:39,053
<i>And people will die
waiting outside a condo
for medical care.</i>

441
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:41,106
<i>[Sighs]</i>

442
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:51,312
<i>Start praying for a 12-car pile-up
on the turnpike 'cause we're not
exactly swimming in livers over here.</i>

443
00:21:56,677 --> 00:22:00,310
When you're testifying,
skip the details on how
House convinced Cuddy.

444
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:03,552
I don't think the people who got
bumped down the transplant list
need to know why.

445
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:05,016
It didn't matter anyway.

446
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:06,494
<i>Sam:
She next on the list?</i>

447
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:07,174
<i>Yes.</i>

448
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:09,394
<i>But she's AB negative.</i>

449
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,744
<i>Very rare.</i>

450
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,572
<i>How long can she
go on like this?</i>

451
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,565
<i>Probably another day or two.</i>

452
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,593
<i>I'm donating my liver.</i>

453
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:21,878
<i>Sam, we've talked about this.</i>

454
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:24,854
<i>I'm a perfect match.
6 out of 6 HLA proteins.</i>

455
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:26,566
<i>How'd you get
checked out so fast?</i>

456
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,934
<i>I know a guy
in medical testing
and I paid him to rush it.</i>

457
00:22:29,087 --> 00:22:31,064
Sam bribed someone
to rush his test?

458
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:32,033
Wouldn't you?

459
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:35,686
Someone's going to get
the blame for what happened,
so the more we spread it around...

460
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,624
might as well... you said
no surgeon would do a live donor
transplant on such short notice.

461
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:43,152
House took care of that too.

462
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:47,824
<i>Your patient's hardly clotting.</i>

463
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:51,742
<i>Sub-Q vitamin K and
fresh frozen plasma pre-op.</i>

464
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:52,600
<i>Pretty risky.</i>

465
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:55,504
<i>Well that's why I came to
the best transplant surgeon
in the hospital.</i>

466
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:57,209
<i>She's dead without you.</i>

467
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:00,981
<i>Get her in this afternoon.</i>

468
00:23:01,065 --> 00:23:03,622
<i>[Sighs]
Thank you very much.</i>

469
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:04,862
<i>My pleasure.</i>

470
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:07,958
And this was right before
you ran the marathon, I suppose?

471
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:12,097
Was it the part where
he warmly clasped my hands
in thanks, was that too much?

472
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:13,130
What'd you do to him?

473
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:15,993
The hospital lawyer asks me
if I did something unethical.

474
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:18,700
If I did,
the last person I tell is
the hospital lawyer,

475
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,108
especially since she's gone
all 'old testament' on me.

476
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,382
You'll tell me.

477
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,418
Oh. Ok then.

478
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:27,593
One caveat,
I've moved past threesomes.

479
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:29,095
I'm now into foursomes.

480
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,764
If someone backs out then
you've still got a threesome.

481
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,300
If two people back out,
you're still having sex.

482
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:35,947
You'd be amazed.
Even if three people...

483
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:38,037
Anything you say
is attorney-client.

484
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:40,366
So you can get advice about
the bad bad thing you did,

485
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,084
knowing I'll be tortured
because I can't tell a soul.

486
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:46,667
Actually, it is kinda cool.

487
00:23:47,732 --> 00:23:50,586
<i>Are you completely
out of your mind?</i>

488
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:55,060
<i>She's dying on her own,
why would I volunteer
to be her executioner?</i>

489
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,463
<i>I'd just be inviting
a lawsuit from the brother,
no matter what!</i>

490
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:02,055
<i>5 grand.</i>

491
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:03,560
<i>And that's just ante money.</i>

492
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,903
<i>After the surgery,
you get another 15.</i>

493
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,681
<i>Though I warn you,
that includes the tip.</i>

494
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:10,106
<i>[Laughs scornfully]</i>

495
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:16,257
<i>I make 600 grand a year,
you think I'm going to risk tanking
my percentages for 20 thousand?</i>

496
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:17,788
<i>It's tax free.</i>

497
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:21,278
<i>For the record,
I hope the department
takes you and Chase</i>

498
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:24,618
<i>and drop-kicks both your asses
out the back door.</i>

499
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:26,793
<i>Great.</i>

500
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:31,310
<i>That means I don't have to
bother welshing on the 15 grand
I would have owed you.</i>

501
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,818
<i>If you don't do the surgery,
I'm going to tell your wife</i>

502
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,166
<i>that you've been sleeping
with a series of nurses.</i>

503
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:41,423
<i>Currently Nurse Cuttler
in Radiology.</i>

504
00:24:41,924 --> 00:24:45,061
<i>Now what's 600 grand
divided by two?</i>

505
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:49,677
<i>Last Christmas party,
Nurse Cuttler handed you
one of those little hotdogs.</i>

506
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:51,699
<i>And you didn't thank her.</i>

507
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,546
<i>Well that only happens
when you're very very intimate.</i>

508
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:59,826
<i>That and the fact that
you've been practically dancing
around with your zipper open,</i>

509
00:25:00,018 --> 00:25:02,174
<i>used condom stuck in your shoe.</i>

510
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:04,492
<i>Your wife is apparently
the only one who doesn't know.</i>

511
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,245
<i>There is no way you'll tell her.</i>

512
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:09,251
<i>Of course I won't.
I'm much too cowardly.</i>

513
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,532
<i>No, I'd just send
an anonymous letter.</i>

514
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,048
<i>Now I've uh...</i>

515
00:25:13,132 --> 00:25:16,111
<i>I've got an OR booked
for 4 this afternoon.</i>

516
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:17,902
<i>Are you free?</i>

517
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:24,320
<i>Hmm. Oh, and
for the record,</i>

518
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:27,576
<i>you are the worst
transplant surgeon
in this hospital.</i>

519
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:31,366
<i>But unfortunately,
you're the only one who's
currently cheating on his wife.</i>

520
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:40,814
You bribed him and then
you blackmailed him?!

521
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:43,875
She'd have been dead
in 2 days if I hadn't made
Ayersman do the surgery.

522
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:46,242
Leave the blackmail out of
the story you tell the committee.

523
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:48,404
Tried to leave it out of
the story I told you.

524
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:50,680
And then there was
that incident in the parking lot.

525
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,658
<i>Don't do that! Wait!
What are you nuts?!</i>

526
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:56,752
<i>Please! I didn't do it!
I didn't do anything!</i>

527
00:25:56,753 --> 00:25:57,911
<i>- No!
- Please!</i>

528
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:01,174
Apparently, someone sent
an anonymous letter to his wife.

529
00:26:01,277 --> 00:26:05,074
You blackmailed Ayersman
before he performed the surgery
and then you ratted him out anyway?!

530
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:06,423
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

531
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:08,123
You just can't
control yourself, can you?

532
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,568
No matter how stupid,
how self-destructive...

533
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,931
To make this conversation easier,

534
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:16,661
can we discard the fiction that
we're talking about anything
other than what I did to you?

535
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:19,700
You're not mad
because I broke into
your psychiatrist's office.

536
00:26:19,784 --> 00:26:20,932
Yeah, I was
thrilled about that.

537
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:22,210
Okay, it was
a lousy thing to do,

538
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:25,736
but if what I'd found was that
everything was all kittens
and moonbeams in Markville,

539
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:28,176
- you'd be over it.
- No I wouldn't!

540
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:30,708
You're mad at me for
letting you know what I did

541
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:33,068
because you liked
where things were going.

542
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:38,201
And for that
I actually am sorry.

543
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:40,113
It was stupid.

544
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:53,501
Let me tell you a story
about a patient.

545
00:26:53,831 --> 00:26:57,363
The patient we'll call Fusan.

546
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,425
Chase:
Because Sam had
rushed his tests,

547
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:03,540
we were able to get them
into surgery that afternoon.

548
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:07,627
Dr. Ayersman performed
the live donor transplant.

549
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:12,652
He ressected
the right lobe, hepatic vein,
and hepatic artery of Sam's liver,

550
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:17,023
and transplanted it into Kayla.
The operation was a success.

551
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:20,442
Kayla and Sam continued
to receive routine care.

552
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:25,127
Two months later,
she came by for an exam.

553
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:28,399
July 24th, be precise.
You did the exam?

554
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:30,060
- Honestly, I just wanted to...
- Honestly?

555
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:31,436
So you've been
lying up until now?

556
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,054
Let's make a deal.
I won't use the word
'honestly', and

557
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:37,357
you'll quit stopping by
to see House so you don't
take it out on me afterwards,

558
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:38,462
how about that?

559
00:27:40,764 --> 00:27:43,320
I wanted to be as far away
from Kayla as possible,

560
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:45,714
but House was
rubbing my nose in it.

561
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:47,418
<i>How are the girls?</i>

562
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:49,353
<i>They're great.</i>

563
00:27:49,522 --> 00:27:52,760
<i>Dory had her first crush,
which was cute.</i>

564
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:53,562
<i>Oh yeah?</i>

565
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:58,053
<i>And then her first sort of
break up, which was not so cute.
[Thermometer peeps]</i>

566
00:28:00,276 --> 00:28:03,715
<i>You're hot. 99.3</i>

567
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:05,727
<i>- You been coughing?
- No.</i>

568
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,534
<i>- Pain in urinating?
- No.</i>

569
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:12,883
<i>99's not that high, is it?</i>

570
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:16,710
<i>Immunosuppressants block fevers,
you shouldn't have one at all.</i>

571
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:20,919
<i>I'm sending a nurse
in here to draw cultures,</i>

572
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,216
<i>and I'm ordering
a chest x-ray.</i>

573
00:28:23,282 --> 00:28:25,197
I wasn't making
any more mistakes.

574
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:27,321
Another phrase to avoid
in front of the committee.

575
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,615
She spikes a fever
an hour later.

576
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:33,307
<i>Her AST and ALT are up.
She's rejecting the liver.</i>

577
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:37,060
<i>No, it's just an infection.
One of our cultures
is growing a strep.</i>

578
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:38,641
<i>Just one?
Probably a contaminant.</i>

579
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:41,485
<i>She's dehydrated,
her haematocrit's way up, it's strep!</i>

580
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:42,953
<i>Transaminases are up too.</i>

581
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:44,188
<i>It's just stress
from the strep.</i>

582
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:47,453
<i>Geez, Chase,
you and this strep.
Get a room already.</i>

583
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:49,501
<i>She's not rejecting the liver!</i>

584
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:52,602
<i>It's just an infection,
she'll be fine.</i>

585
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:54,397
<i>Worst case
we could re-list her.</i>

586
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:55,524
<i>You House?</i>

587
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:59,265
<i>Umm...well that depends.
Are you going to hit.</i>

588
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:00,521
<i>Dr. House?</i>

589
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:03,913
<i>You haven't even seen my sister
and you're being cute with me?</i>

590
00:29:03,997 --> 00:29:07,095
<i>Sam, we're talking about her
right now. Her fever might...</i>

591
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:11,330
<i>Could be Hep B, Hep C, right?
It's treatable. You give her
interferon, she's ok.</i>

592
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:12,244
<i>Right?</i>

593
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:14,003
<i>You know a lot
about hepatitis.</i>

594
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:15,915
<i>He just donated his liver.</i>

595
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:19,647
<i>You're flushed.
You sick?</i>

596
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:20,528
<i>I'm tired.</i>

597
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:22,886
<i>You're hiding
the fact that you're sick.</i>

598
00:29:23,699 --> 00:29:25,400
<i>- Now why would you do that?
- Hey, wait, what are you...</i>

599
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:29,978
<i>Now either you specifically
asked for a tattoo of a heart that's
been left out in the sun too long,</i>

600
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:31,978
<i>or that is a really
bad home job.</i>

601
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,578
<i>It's a very common way
of getting Hep C, which you have.</i>

602
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:37,622
<i>You've had it a long time.</i>

603
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,724
<i>It was going to keep me
from giving my liver.</i>

604
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,801
<i>You paid off that lab tech
to say you were clean?!</i>

605
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,116
<i>It hasn't been active in years.
She was going to die if I...</i>

606
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,674
<i>You paid someone off?
That is TOTALLY unethical!</i>

607
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:54,936
<i>Get an MRI for him and
his sister right now.</i>

608
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:58,118
<i>She got Hep
from me, didn't she?</i>

609
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:00,937
<i>No! No no no, god no!</i>

610
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:03,492
<i>I think she got
cancer from you.</i>

611
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:10,899
House was right?

612
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:15,062
Brother had an undiagnosed hepatoma
that was transplanted with his liver.

613
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:18,958
Grew a lot faster in Kayla
because she was immunosuppressed.

614
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,779
How could House have known?

615
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:22,862
Hepatitis can
cause liver cancer.

616
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,637
Plus her haematocrit,
red blood cell count was high.

617
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:32,521
Usually means dehydration,
rare cases ... cancer.

618
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,249
We probably
saved Sam's life.

619
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:39,857
We were able to operate on him
early enough before it metastasized.

620
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:45,892
Kayla had already started
rejecting the liver.

621
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:47,775
And you couldn't re-list her
because of the cancer.

622
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:49,179
Nothing we could do.

623
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:50,763
This is good.

624
00:30:50,912 --> 00:30:53,491
The brother lying about his Hep.
It's an intervening act,

625
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:55,968
the proximate cause of her cancer and not your mistake.

626
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:59,161
She would have died six months ago
if he hadn't given up his liver.

627
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:02,566
Maybe. Can't prove it.
[Stacy's beeper goes off]

628
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,881
You need to come with me.

629
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:09,108
Just been served with papers.
Actually paper. One page.

630
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:14,346
Defendant
Princeton-Plainsborough hospital
and Dr. Robert Chase,

631
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:18,253
blah blah blah,
medical malpractice,
negligence, blah blah.

632
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:19,639
You're surprised
they're suing?

633
00:31:19,723 --> 00:31:22,493
You think
people love Chase so much
they're gonna just forgo...

634
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:25,982
Punitive damages
in the amount of
10 million dollars.

635
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:28,803
Punitives?!
That means they're
alleging gross negligence.

636
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:30,827
Well he's obviously
out of his mind!

637
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:33,013
Larry Wusekus.
He's not crazy.

638
00:31:33,116 --> 00:31:35,231
Ooh! I've been sued by him.

639
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:38,288
YOU have been hiding things
and lying to me all day!

640
00:31:38,352 --> 00:31:39,981
I haven't lied
about anything.

641
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:42,733
Except for the parts that
I admitted I was lying about.

642
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:45,822
And I'm not the one
being sued. I feel funny.

643
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:49,629
[Sighs] Well,
what haven't you told us?

644
00:31:57,911 --> 00:32:03,199
[Sighs] Before she checked out,
Sam found her a second liver.

645
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,022
- She had cancer, how could she...
- Black market.

646
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:08,917
There was a doctor in Mexico City
who was going to do the surgery.

647
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:10,926
<i>Chase:
She's leaving from JFK at 5.</i>

648
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,832
<i>To meet some Mexican guy
in the back of a van with a pig's liver
and a hacksaw?! This is nuts!</i>

649
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,451
<i>You want to
rat me out to House?</i>

650
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:18,852
<i>He'll say if there's a chance
in a billion then go for it.</i>

651
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:20,495
<i>This is not what she wants!</i>

652
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:25,423
<i>She's being manipulated
by a morally guilty brother
and a legally guiltier doctor.</i>

653
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:26,711
<i>You think she wants to die?</i>

654
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:28,856
<i>She's dying either way.</i>

655
00:32:30,312 --> 00:32:31,253
<i>Chase.</i>

656
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:36,710
<i>How many people you know
walking around with a black market organ
from a third world surgeon, huh?</i>

657
00:32:36,794 --> 00:32:38,910
<i>Foreman:
This isn't going to
be your salvation!</i>

658
00:32:39,006 --> 00:32:41,537
<i>It's just one more thing
they'll pin on you!</i>

659
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:45,277
<i>Go in there,
be the good guy.</i>

660
00:32:50,032 --> 00:32:52,722
<i>- We need to talk.
- No, there's no time.</i>

661
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:53,982
<i>Two minutes.</i>

662
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:58,343
<i>Kayla, I made a mistake.</i>

663
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:02,313
<i>I wasn't as blunt
as I should have been
about you all the time.</i>

664
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,786
<i>Probably didn't
want to face it myself.</i>

665
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:06,829
<i>Dr. Chase,
please don't do this.</i>

666
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:11,675
<i>Stress of the travel,
the operation,
even then, the cancer.</i>

667
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,022
<i>Kayla, we are going!</i>

668
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:14,498
<i>My dad died.</i>

669
00:33:15,504 --> 00:33:16,949
<i>Lung cancer.</i>

670
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:20,242
<i>I saw him a couple of months
before it happened,
we never talked about it.</i>

671
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:22,288
<i>I'm sorry
your father died,
but it has nothing...</i>

672
00:33:22,372 --> 00:33:25,096
<i>He never even
told me he was sick.</i>

673
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:27,315
<i>I wish he had.</i>

674
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:31,170
<i>It wou...
[Takes a deep breath]</i>

675
00:33:32,152 --> 00:33:34,923
<i>You're gonna die. Alone.</i>

676
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:39,581
<i>Thousand of miles from your children,
you don't want to do that to them.</i>

677
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:48,193
<i>Kayla...</i>

678
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,402
<i>[Whispers]
I'm sorry Sam.</i>

679
00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:54,712
<i>Kayla, you can't give up.</i>

680
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,065
<i>If you do this,</i>

681
00:33:59,926 --> 00:34:02,474
<i>if you go home...</i>

682
00:34:03,615 --> 00:34:05,987
<i>I killed you.</i>

683
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:10,318
<i>No.</i>

684
00:34:12,595 --> 00:34:15,659
<i>You gave me 3 months.</i>

685
00:34:15,943 --> 00:34:19,960
<i>You gave Dory and Nicky
3 more months with me.</i>

686
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,141
<i>And when they
found my cancer,</i>

687
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:27,678
<i>they found yours.</i>

688
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:34,987
<i>And I got to
save my baby brother.</i>

689
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:45,341
<i>[Sam starts to cry]</i>

690
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,890
Chase:
A week later,
Kayla died at home.

691
00:34:49,312 --> 00:34:51,117
Sam was furious.

692
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,833
Gotta be why
there'd be a lawsuit.

693
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:53,995
Cuddy:
Are you buying this?!

694
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,845
Of course not,
there was no illegal transplant,
there's no causation.

695
00:34:56,955 --> 00:35:00,988
He was ready to kill me!
Maybe he's lying to his lawyers.

696
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:05,324
Or you're lying to us.
Last thursday he saw you
for post-op care.

697
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:08,696
If you hate your doctor,
you find another doctor
before you find a lawyer.

698
00:35:09,436 --> 00:35:12,462
This guy didn't sue
Cameron or Foreman.
He didn't even sue House.

699
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:16,312
Something personal here,
something you don't want us
to know before your hearing.

700
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,982
The guy didn't hate you
before that meeting,
he hated you after.

701
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:26,026
<i>So how's everything else?
The girls?</i>

702
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,209
<i>Ah, you know...
a lot of crying.
Some nightmares.</i>

703
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:34,348
<i>We'll be ok, though.</i>

704
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:36,372
<i>Good.</i>

705
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:39,699
<i>Girls are not going to be happy
about leaving town, though.</i>

706
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:45,260
<i>They love that house.
The yard, their friends.</i>

707
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:46,298
<i>You're moving?</i>

708
00:35:46,298 --> 00:35:49,759
<i>Ever since the operation
I've been on disability...</i>

709
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,506
<i>and there's the mortgage so...</i>

710
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:55,999
<i>moving out to stay
somewhere cheaper.</i>

711
00:35:57,085 --> 00:36:00,199
<i>Anyways, thanks.</i>

712
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,862
<i>I killed your sister.</i>

713
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:09,318
<i>I mis-diagnosed her ulcer.</i>

714
00:36:10,655 --> 00:36:11,434
<i>Killed her.</i>

715
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:13,473
<i>Shut up man.</i>

716
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,736
<i>She liked you, just...</i>

717
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,768
<i>I was hung-over when
she came back to see me.</i>

718
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:20,797
<i>I'd been up
half the night drinking,</i>

719
00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:24,337
<i>had a headache,
and I just wanted to
get the hell out of there.</i>

720
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,483
<i>Couldn't care less what
your sister was saying
about her stomach pain.</i>

721
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:36,999
<i>[ Loud crashing noise]</i>

722
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:49,210
May I speak to my
future former employee?

723
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,010
House:
Great story.

724
00:36:52,094 --> 00:36:55,106
You think I'm lying?
It's exactly what I told him.

725
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:59,565
I'm sure it is.
But you lied to him.
You want him to sue you.

726
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,289
I killed his sister!

727
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:04,762
I ordered black coffee
this morning and got cream.

728
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,068
Everybody screws up.

729
00:37:06,152 --> 00:37:08,050
They didn't put
poison in your coffee.

730
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:09,686
I've seen you hung-over.

731
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,101
You weren't the day
you blew his sister's diagnosis.

732
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:15,291
What does it matter why?
Is she less dead
if I have a good excuse?

733
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:18,398
If I thought you'd screwed up
because you were drunk,
I would have fired you.

734
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:19,535
You knew?

735
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:21,869
You were depressed
and distracted.

736
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:26,133
I assumed you'd gotten
a phone call from your step mom.

737
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:30,309
<i>[On the phone]
This is Robert.</i>

738
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:38,756
<i>Umm...</i>

739
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:42,565
<i>what did he die of?</i>

740
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:48,717
<i>That's impossible.</i>

741
00:37:49,153 --> 00:37:53,505
<i>I saw him two months ago,
if he had lung cancer,
he would have...</i>

742
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:03,557
<i>Dr. Chase?</i>

743
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:20,754
Good news is, both your
parents are dead now so...

744
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,116
no reason to
screw up this bad again.

745
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,113
How'd you know?

746
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:29,911
There's this interconnected
network of computers,
or interweb where you can...

747
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:31,456
How did you know to look?

748
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:36,800
[Sighs]
When he visited he told me
he only had two months left.

749
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:39,624
When you screwed up
I did the math.

750
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,786
Why didn't you tell me
he was dying?

751
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:43,536
He asked me not to.

752
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,822
So you just hung me
out there to be blindsided.

753
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:52,049
Yeah Chase, it was all my fault.

754
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:56,627
Look, you got a choice.
You can either tell the truth,

755
00:38:56,772 --> 00:39:01,340
hospital settles,
family gets some money,
they get to keep their house.

756
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,749
Or you can keep up this lie,

757
00:39:06,025 --> 00:39:10,627
family gets punitive damages,
they buy a jet,
they move to park avenue,

758
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:13,666
and you have to
find another career.

759
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:15,780
You're not going to say anything?

760
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:18,035
I'm going to keep my mouth shut.

761
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:24,568
Legally, it's better for me
if you go down in flames.

762
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,871
Is Chase telling the committee
about his dad?

763
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:47,468
I don't know.

764
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:53,172
I thought you were going to
get him to sell me out.

765
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:55,869
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

766
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:58,179
You're my client too.

767
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:00,307
Yeah.

768
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,139
And that's not going to change
unless you leave this job.

769
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:07,172
Or I do.

770
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:12,709
So how do you deal with
a coworker that you have feelings for,
positive or negative.

771
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:16,955
I don't want to end up like Chase,

772
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:22,512
I don't want to get emotionally
caught up and kill... you.

773
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,241
It's not all negative.

774
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,864
Maybe you were right. Maybe...

775
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:50,311
maybe that is the problem.

776
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,733
So what do we do?

777
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:06,363
I don't know.

778
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,304
Dr. House.

779
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:26,209
After considering the testimonial
and documentary evidence,

780
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:30,219
this committee in the matter
of Kayla McGinley
has reached a decision.

781
00:41:30,304 --> 00:41:31,583
Dr. Chase,

782
00:41:32,638 --> 00:41:35,227
your error resulted
in a patient's death.

783
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:39,034
You also lied,
both to your superiors
and the patient's brother.

784
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,378
But taking into account
the mitigating factor of
your father's death,

785
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:46,211
we've decided not to
revoke your privileges.

786
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:50,580
You'll receive one week's suspension,
and a letter in your permanent file.

787
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:52,810
Now as for Dr. House...

788
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:57,613
there is no evidence of a failure
to supervise that would lead
to disciplinary action.

789
00:41:57,954 --> 00:42:03,423
And yet, there is enough
in the record to be very
troubled by your conduct,

790
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,963
including certain allegations
of black mail from members
of the transplant team.

791
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:12,009
And by your general refusal
to meet with your patients.

792
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:17,378
It should be noted that your patient's
cancer was diagnosed as the result of
a direct physical examination of...

793
00:42:17,462 --> 00:42:20,234
Not of the patient,
I met the brother.
Never met her.

794
00:42:20,425 --> 00:42:23,754
You want me to go to a family reunion
every time I take on a patient?

795
00:42:24,656 --> 00:42:27,501
The committee has determined
that for no less than one month,

796
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:33,228
Dr. House will have his practice
supervised by another doctor,
to be designated by Dr Cuddy.

797
00:42:33,346 --> 00:42:35,602
This proceeding is adjourned.

798
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,001
Did you know
this was coming?

799
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:54,102
They contacted me
about an hour ago.

800
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:55,873
What's happening to Chase?

801
00:42:56,221 --> 00:42:57,530
Now you're fired!

802
00:42:57,632 --> 00:42:59,973
No, he's not.

803
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:04,579
Dr. House, meet your new boss.
