[A baby crying]

2
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,417
Honey?

3
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:36,824
Are you all right?

4
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:37,973
Yeah.

5
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,917
Yeah. I'm just fighting
off a stomach bug.

6
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,842
I'll be fine.

7
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:44,189
Did he sleep okay?

8
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:46,855
Great, as long as
I was holding him.

9
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:49,468
I can't wait
for colic to be over.

10
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:51,566
Oh, shh.

11
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,816
There you go, Mikey.
Bath time's coming.

12
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,857
He lifted his head yesterday.

13
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:01,146
Take the day off.

14
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:04,530
I mean, you're sick anyway,
and you hardly ever see him.

15
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:06,858
Or me.

16
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:07,897
I can't.

17
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:11,023
I got a meeting
with Crandall's Kitchens.
I think that deal's gonna close.

18
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:15,072
They called about
the car payment again.

19
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,133
It's 2 months late.

20
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,807
We're gonna be fine, honey.

21
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:25,875
Enjoy your bath,
little man.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,551
You know, honey...

23
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:50,199
Honey, I'm not gonna go in.

24
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:52,757
I'm coming down
with something.

25
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:57,345
Honey?

26
00:01:58,453 --> 00:01:59,758
Kara.

27
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,936
Kara?

28
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:07,137
Kara!

29
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:14,640
Mikey!

30
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:17,131
Mikey!

31
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:19,461
Kara!

32
00:02:22,302 --> 00:02:23,415
Mikey!

Before we called in
*** merged in the bathtub.

36
00:02:57,712 --> 00:03:00,093
Don't know how long.
Non-responsive at the scene.

37
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:01,424
[Crying]

38
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,167
Obviously breathing now.

39
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,083
Continue the blow-by.
Stat portable chest.

40
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:07,232
- Caucasian, female, 32.
- Where am I?

41
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:09,255
Tonic-clonic seizure
in the bathroom.

42
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:11,508
Where am I?

43
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:12,829
Come on, one, two, three.

44
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:13,738
Where am I?

45
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,577
On three-- one, two, three.

46
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:17,905
You're in the hospital, honey.

47
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,124
Mikey's here,
and the doctors say
he's gonna be okay.

48
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:22,173
Hopefully.
He needs to be checked out
by the NICU.

49
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,316
What happened?

50
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:24,946
- You passed out.
- What?

51
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,942
Mikey fell.

52
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:27,575
Has your wife had
a seizure before?

53
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,429
No.

54
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,739
I can't mve my head.
I want to see him!

55
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:33,246
He's right here, honey.
He's right here.

56
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:34,979
Tonight...

57
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:36,905
L Word marathon.

58
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:38,720
You watch The L Word?

59
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,152
On mute.

60
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,798
I'll pass.

61
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:44,802
Dinner with Cuddy.

62
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:50,093
Still sucking up so
she'll fund your play space
for the chemo kids?

63
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,329
They really ought to save their energy
for other things. Like crying.

64
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,781
[Elevator dings]

65
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:56,715
She's the suck-up.

66
00:03:57,535 --> 00:03:59,345
She asked you?

67
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:03,579
She's smart. She knows if
she buys me enough alcohol,

68
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:06,517
my defenses just
might be weakened.

69
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,133
Doesn't make sense.
Unless she ran out of batteries.

70
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:14,615
Hey...
I'm recently single.
She's single.

71
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,550
You're too nice
for her to like you.

72
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:20,300
She's not needy enough
for you to like her.

73
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:25,377
She's got an agenda,
just not one that includes
an appearance by little Jimmy.

74
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,301
I'll poll my peeps.

75
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,676
How many of you think
that Cuddy asked--

76
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:31,929
Or rather, "peep."

77
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:34,272
Chase caught a case in the E.R.
He wants us to take a look.

78
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:39,539
Unless Chase broke his neck
falling off his polo pony,
he had no reason to be in the E.R.

79
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:41,965
Cuddy put him
on a two-week NICU rotation.

80
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:44,191
Patient had
an unexplained seizure.

81
00:04:45,107 --> 00:04:48,313
Seizures are cool to watch,
boring to diagnose.

82
00:04:48,397 --> 00:04:49,383
How about Foreman?

83
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,649
He needs to get
his malingering butt back here.

84
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:53,098
He almost died.

85
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:55,473
Almost being the operative word.

86
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,732
Hey.

87
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:59,113
How are you doing?
You look great.

88
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:02,334
Thanks.
I feel great.

89
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:04,926
Glad you're back.

90
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,698
Cameron makes lousy coffee.

91
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:11,058
I take mine black, the way I take
my brain-damaged neurologists.

92
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:12,828
Happy to help.

93
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,025
How you coming along?

94
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,791
Tell  her everything's great.

95
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,714
Neither of us wants
to deal with her guilt.

96
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:22,382
- I don't feel guilty.
- Of course not.

97
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:25,599
Hell, if people felt guilt every time
they accidentally lobotomized a guy...

98
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:28,126
- I was trying to save his life.
- Yeah.

99
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:30,065
Your heart was
in the right place.

100
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:35,474
It's just his brain is not quite
where it's supposed to be.

101
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:39,114
Tell her everything's great.

102
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:40,154
It's true.

103
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:42,048
No  more left-side,
right-side reversals.

104
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:45,968
Still some short-term memory loss
and spatial processing problems, but

105
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:47,930
trying not to be
too hard on myself.

106
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:49,818
Yeah.
Might pull a muscle.

107
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,994
We have a case?

108
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:53,164
Seizure that can't be
explained by epilepsy.

109
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,222
And accompanied by
elevated calcium levels.

110
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:56,785
Still bored.

111
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:57,970
Tell her why.

112
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:02,606
Because seizure with
mildly elevated calcium is...
diagnostically simple.

113
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,562
It's either hyperparathyroid, cancer,
or calcium-mediated neurotoxicity.

114
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:08,911
Well done.

115
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,631
But until you can remember
how to make coffee,
hands off the patients.

116
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:14,945
H ouse.

117
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:17,481
All those reasons
this case bores you...

118
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:20,175
The ER has already
ruled them out.

119
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:32,980
Lungs are clear.
Get an EEG confirming
brain function's okay.

120
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:35,672
Can we focus
on the task at hand?

121
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:39,794
Why did mommy twitch so hard that
she tossed the baby in with the bathwater?

122
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:40,871
You don't need me for this.

123
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:42,826
Of course I need you.
We're a team.

124
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:44,422
Polyarteritis nodosa.

125
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:46,523
Inflamed arteries in the brain
cause seizures.

126
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:49,465
Inflamed arteries in the kidneys
cause calcium buildup.

127
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:50,486
You're a moron.

128
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:53,185
Did you even look at the file?
Kidney function's fine.

129
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,533
- Whipple's.
- What?

130
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,145
Whipple's.

131
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:58,894
Test her.

132
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:00,962
Cameron thinks
it starts with a "W."

133
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:02,839
I'm thinking "V."

134
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,945
Dad vomited this morning.
Maybe they've both got strep.

135
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:09,718
Think you can do
a strep throat culture without the swab
ending up in the guy's poop chute?

136
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:12,223
- "V" for vasoconstriction.
- It got to be my guess.

137
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:14,656
Excess calcium makes blood vessels
in the brain clamp down.

138
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,658
Best-case scenario: seizure.
Worst-case: stroke.

139
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:19,886
Do a digital extraction angiogram.

140
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,789
Foreman can't tell up from down.
Cameron's a girl.

141
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:26,995
- All that mechanical stuff.
- Sorry, Cuddy says I'm stuck here.

142
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:48,147
You're late.

143
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:51,695
And you are
in my locked office.

144
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:53,686
Again.

145
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:54,977
Whatcha got there?

146
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:57,376
Special panties
for your date with Wilson?

147
00:07:57,431 --> 00:07:59,291
It's not a date, and
it's none of your business.

148
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,358
If it's not a date,
it is business.

149
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:03,924
And if it was business,
you wouldn't say
it was none of my business.

150
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,856
What do you want?

151
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,498
I wanna talk about
your date with Wilson.

152
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,682
- It's not a date.
- This is fun.

153
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:12,164
Spring Chase from NICU,
and I'll shut up about your date.

154
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,028
NICU is short-staffed.

155
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:16,807
You suddenly lost
the ability to lie.

156
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:20,026
Nobody's quit NICU
in two years.

157
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,038
And if you're making up reasons,
that means there is no reason.

158
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,923
Which means he asked
for the assignment, didn't he?

159
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:31,666
If Chase needs a break
from you, he should take it.

160
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,997
Absolutely.

161
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:49,249
Both mom and dad
are negative for strep.

162
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,796
You'll be back playing
with the big toys soon.

163
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,259
Or not.
Either way, I'm fine.

164
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:58,995
You don't have to say that.

165
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,071
It's okay.

166
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:02,865
I can always work
in a research lab or teach.

167
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:05,679
And you'd be
okay with that?

168
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:07,060
Why wouldn't I be?

169
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:09,408
You were planning on
pursuing grants of your own.

170
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:10,934
Running a department.

171
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,670
I'm alive.

172
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:15,446
Changing jobs,
not making coffee--

173
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:19,954
if that stuff bothers me now,
I don't deserve the second chance.

174
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:24,562
Ungaa.

175
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:32,841
They say that physical contact
helps the healing process.

176
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:52,962
[Alarm starts beeping]

177
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:54,857
What's happening?

178
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,084
Your son's not
getting enough oxygen.
Take Mr. Mason outside.

179
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:05,895
Uhh! Uh! Ahh! Uhh!

180
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:10,352
Lung's collapsed.
He's not getting any air.
I need an IV catheter!

181
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:11,450
Uh!

182
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,775
Aah! Aahh!

183
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:14,764
You have a seizure?

184
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,519
Her chest muscles are contracting.
It's something else.

185
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,265
Aah!

186
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:26,931
Her whole back is spasming.
I need 2 milligrams Lorazepam, stat.

187
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:37,020
He's okay.

188
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,952
His lung wouldn't collapse
if he was okay.

189
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,481
What is happening?

190
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:43,511
I have no idea.

191
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:47,149
Aah! Aah!

192
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:07,280
House:
So...what causes seizures,
hypercalcemia,

193
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,959
and the thing where
mommy bends like Gumby?

194
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:11,467
Little busy here.

195
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,620
Uh-oh...

196
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,943
baby's lungs are gonna
conk out any minute.

197
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:16,148
Probably wanna deal with that.

198
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:18,842
I'll get right on it
as soon as I finish
indulging my boss.

199
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:19,893
Multitask.

200
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,537
Chemical pneumonitis.

201
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:24,179
Bubble bath got into the baby's lungs
when he was underwater.

202
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:25,761
Start him on prednisone.

203
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,160
Keep him on high FI-02.

204
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,327
Let the indulging commence.

205
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:32,647
Lithium could cause all three
of the mother's symptoms.

206
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:34,114
No record she's on lithium.

207
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:35,303
And tox screen was negative.

208
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,991
Lithium doesn't show on
a basic tox screen, Scarecrow.

209
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,807
Myelomatous meningitis
could also cover everything.

210
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,092
Rare complications
of a rare blood cancer.

211
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,417
You're not totally hopeless.

212
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:48,445
Get an S-PEP and an MRI
for myelomatous meningitis.

213
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,415
Search the patient's place
for lithium.

214
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:53,853
Baby's lung problem is
bacterial, not chemical--
start ECMO.

215
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:57,296
While you're searching
for the lithium, take a water sample
and check the pipes.

216
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,613
You want me to
write this down for you?

217
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,206
I ask you,
is almost dying any excuse
for not being fun?

218
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,833
I'm not putting
that baby on ECMO.

219
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:14,348
The chance of there being
bacteria in bathwater--

220
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:16,298
Why don't you
wanna work for me?

221
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:19,308
I'm nice,
and fun at parties.

222
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:22,939
I'm not working NICU
because of you.

223
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:26,961
The baby's X-ray suggested
chemical pneumonitis.

224
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,175
Not to me.

225
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:30,420
X-ray was too consolidated.

226
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,496
So why are you down here?

227
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:37,145
Hoping to expand your make-out pool
to include the preemie to
nine-year-old demographic?

228
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:43,151
I needed a break.

229
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:46,368
From the patients.

230
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:49,132
They lie to us all the time.

231
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:52,807
Foreman almost died trying
to save a drug-dealing cop.

232
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,068
I just wanted to get away
from that for a while.

233
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:01,126
What a complete load of crap.

234
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,650
What am I, a nurse
you're trying to prep with
this vulnerability thing?

235
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,110
ECMO could kill him.

236
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:14,035
You don't start him on ECMO, and
that infection could rampage through his body
like Pistons fans after a championship.

237
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:14,034
[Elevator dings]

238
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,981
But you do it your way.

239
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,540
Nothing more honest
than a dead baby.

240
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,687
ECMO stands for
Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation.

241
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,129
Basically, we remove
your son's blood--

242
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:29,318
All of his blood?

243
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:33,759
We run it through a machine,
which takes out carbon dioxide
and adds oxygen.

244
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:37,080
Then we re-warm the blood
and run it back into his body.

245
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:42,399
There is a significant risk
of internal hemorrhaging,
and he may also suffer--

246
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:45,325
You put him on antibiotics.
Won't that take care of the infection?

247
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:46,934
Not fast enough.

248
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,111
Are you sure this is
Mikey's best shot?

249
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,911
Absolutely.

250
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:22,940
- Cuddy's trash.
- Not anymore.

251
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,690
Paid good money for it.

252
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,620
Look at what she bought.

253
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,699
Red clover.

254
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:31,661
What is red clover
used for, Dr. Wilson?

255
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,455
It's also used
to treat asthma.

256
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:37,061
Psoriasis... joint pain.

257
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,980
She doesn't wheeze,
flake, or ache.

258
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:43,981
And she didn't ask a pulmonologist
or a dermatologist for dinner.

259
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:46,469
She invited an oncologist.

260
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:48,684
It's not a date.

261
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,845
It's a consult.

262
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:55,112
Mom's MRI was negative
for masses, abscesses.

263
00:14:55,196 --> 00:14:56,883
- There's no sign she has--
- Fascinating.

264
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:57,835
Call me when we have--

265
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,800
She has a subarachnoid bleed.

266
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,802
So why is our patient
bleeding into her brain?

267
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,303
Her blood workup shows
her Pro-Time's elevated.

268
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:10,067
She's bleeding
because she's not clotting.
So why is she not clotting?

269
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,437
What'd you bring us, daddy?

270
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:15,396
Only mood-altering drug
was vodka. The back of a drawer.

271
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:18,759
Hiding booze is
classic alcoholic behavior.
That'd explain the bleeding.

272
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:19,757
What bleeding?

273
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:20,755
You don't remember?

274
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,781
She  bled all over you
this morning.

275
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:26,919
Kidding. Idiots are fun.
No wonder every village wants one.

276
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:30,611
If she's an alcoholic,
she would also be more prone
to hypercalcemia.

277
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,721
But the tox screen
was negative for alcohol.

278
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,264
Hey, it was your idea.

279
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:35,577
Now it's even better.

280
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:38,691
Mommy quits, she gets the DTs.
Even explains the seizure.

281
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,567
Also fits
conversion disorder.

282
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:44,114
They're deep in debt.
He's working round the clock.
They got a new baby.

283
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:47,137
I think the seizure was
a physical response
to psychological stress.

284
00:15:47,248 --> 00:15:49,116
Boozy mommy covers
more symptoms.

285
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,961
Put her in a nice
Phenobarbital coma
before the DTs kill her.

286
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:56,547
Where are you going?

287
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:57,934
To put her in a pheno coma.

288
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:00,093
What if I'm wrong?
What if daddy's the drunk?

289
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:01,120
You want us to give her
the pheno or not?

290
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:02,853
I want him
to argue his point.

291
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,712
I assumed you considered
the father and ruled him out.

292
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:05,544
What's that saying?

293
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:08,417
"When you ass-sume,
you become a pain in the ass to me."

294
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,593
Why should I argue?
You'd just overrule me.

295
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:14,219
Enough! Get a pony
or a watermelon farm.

296
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:15,098
House!

297
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,845
I  need him to react.
I need him to act
like a human being.

298
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,277
I need him to get over
this boring near-death rebirth.

299
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:24,813
I have changed.
It's not something you get over.

300
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:27,242
Nearly dying changes
everything forever.

301
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,763
For about two months.
Two months is too long.

302
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:31,857
I need the guy
I hired back, now.

303
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,073
Now matter how much
your misery loves company,

304
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,610
it's not getting mine.

305
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,040
I'll talk to the dad.
Cameron can take the mom.
We'll figure out if mom was a drinker.

306
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,166
Waste of time.

307
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:42,756
Put her in a coma
before the DTs kill her.

308
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:01,865
So...

309
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,012
Is this a separation or...

310
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:10,529
Well, lawyers have been hired.
Friends divvied up.

311
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:13,027
Oddly, she didn't
fight me for House.

312
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:16,631
[Laughs]
At least there aren't...
kids involved.

313
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:18,432
You just have each other
to deal with.

314
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:19,443
Hmm.

315
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:23,001
If there had been kids,
maybe we would have
done more of that.

316
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:30,155
Do you want kids?

317
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:36,824
Listen, is there
anything in particular
you... wanted to--

318
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,394
Hospital business or--

319
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:39,628
Catching up.

320
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:43,173
I mean, you know,
it's not like...

321
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:46,999
Either one of us has
anybody to run home to.

322
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,305
No.

323
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:02,304
How are you feeling?

324
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,114
Okay.

325
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:06,872
A little groggy.

326
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:09,144
There's  somebody
here to see you.

327
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:15,651
Hey, Mikey.
Mommy's awake.

328
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,302
Oh, Mikey.

329
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,574
Oh, gosh,
I was so scared.

330
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:25,797
Oh.

331
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,012
Oh, I love you.

332
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:33,620
I love you so much.
Ohh. Shh.

333
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,336
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:40,384
You don't have anything
to be sorry about.

335
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:42,580
You were sick.

336
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,599
Turns out
she and her husband
met in AA.

337
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:58,204
Obviously, she slipped.
Good call.

338
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:02,872
It wasn't hard,
considering my other choice
was your stupid psych theory.

339
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:06,075
Which was not stupid.

340
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:10,288
I tell you, I'm gonna
drop the N-bomb if I have to.

341
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,655
You're addicted to conflict.

342
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:14,073
Did they change the name?

343
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:16,705
You could have handled this patient
without dragging Chase in.

344
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:19,086
But that fact that
he didn't want in, killed you.

345
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,854
Just like the fact
you can't get a rise out of me.

346
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:28,441
Where's the baby?

347
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,166
Get off me!

348
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,756
No! I have to do this!

349
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,579
No breath sounds.
Crash cart and epi, stat!

350
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:45,585
Uhh! Uhh!

351
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,912
Told you your psych theory
wasn't stupid.

352
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:51,472
Your son is stable.

353
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:54,016
But the lack of oxygen
damaged his kidneys.

354
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,458
She must have rolled over
on him by mistake.

355
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:58,903
Mr. Mason...

356
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,848
I was there.

357
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,089
Your wife tried
to smother your son.

358
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,033
That's impossible.

359
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,541
Kara would never hurt Mikey.

360
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:15,371
He knows.

361
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:18,130
They said Mikey knows.

362
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:19,842
You hear voices?

363
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:23,785
They wouldn't quit saying that
Mikey would be better off if...

364
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:28,364
They were right.

365
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,030
We've been trying to diagnose
a seizure that didn't exist.

366
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:35,523
She faked it when
her husband caught her.

367
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:36,976
I don't think
she faked it.

368
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:40,065
She just happened to seize
right in the middle of
drowning her child?

369
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:41,370
Good break for the kid.

370
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:43,393
Hey, take it easy on Foreman.

371
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,595
He's playing with one lobe
tied behind his back.

372
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,008
Postpartum psychosis
makes her want to drown her kid.

373
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:49,775
The internal conflict
triggers a seizure.

374
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:51,472
You know what else
might be a trigger?

375
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:53,790
Physical illness.
It's a wild idea, I know.

376
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:58,894
Especially since she doesn't have
any obviously physical symptoms.
Like internal bleeding or excess calcium.

377
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,566
I'll draw some blood.
Test for a--

378
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:04,680
Uhh!
Jeez, you've done it again!
Will you argue with me?!

379
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,080
Drinkers don't eat right.

380
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:09,172
Explains the bleeding and the calcium.
This might just be some crazy drunk,

381
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:11,905
and I'm telling you that she's about
to die of myelomatous meningitis.

382
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:14,698
- We already tested for--
- Exactly! It's an insane idea.

383
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:16,516
Okay.
What do you want me to do?

384
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:18,898
Have an original thought.

385
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,466
In the meantime,
stress her into having
another seizure.

386
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,028
We can't,
she's on haloperidol.

387
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:26,231
You also can't because
it's dangerous and highly unethical.

388
00:21:26,337 --> 00:21:28,576
Therefore, if you get caught,
pretend you can't make coffee.

389
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:30,898
Mental defectives get tons of slack.

390
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:36,042
Take off the haloperidol.
Hook her up to an EEG,

391
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:38,536
flash some lights. Make her pant.
Shoot her up with a placebo.

392
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,009
When she starts twitching,
if the machine twitches along, it's real...

393
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:44,414
if not, call the cops,
'cause she's a psycho killer.

394
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,057
- Stop pushing him.
- Stop protecting him.

395
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:54,240
He needs it.

396
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:57,063
- Not if he wants to get better.
- He might not be able to get better.

397
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:58,671
Well, then, I need
a new neurologist.

398
00:21:58,736 --> 00:21:59,954
He got sick doing his job.

399
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:03,070
If he got killed doing his job,
I wouldn't keep him on the payroll.

400
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:07,378
I don't care how guilty you feel or
how touched you are by his reborn spirit.

401
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:09,039
- I'm not touched.
- Then you're guilt-ridden.

402
00:22:09,123 --> 00:22:11,003
- I'm not guilt-ridden.
- Then you're pathetic.

403
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,020
Right now, I'm annoyed!

404
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:15,115
Keeping him up all night in a seizure lab
is not the way to advance his recovery!

405
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,124
- It's too much!
- You're right.

406
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,658
You should stick around.
Make sure he doesn't screw up.

407
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:31,369
<i>Foreman:
Kara, look directly into the light.</i>

408
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:34,521
Keep looking.

409
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:37,828
Thought you'd be
gone for the day.

410
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,116
Thought I'd wait for
the bone marrow biopsy results.

411
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:43,277
House sent you
to baby-sit me, didn't he?

412
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:45,043
He asked me to wait
for the results.

413
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,963
- Oh, Cameron, it's fine.
- Of course it is.

414
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:53,444
Look. A few weeks ago,
you were upset that
I didn't consider you a friend.

415
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:55,673
Now you're upset
that I'm happy?

416
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:57,763
What can I say?
Apparently, I'm a bitch.

417
00:22:57,857 --> 00:23:00,214
[Laughs]
I didn't say that.

418
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,214
It's annoying.

419
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,947
Insisting every day of your life
is a blessing is basically
calling everyone else shallow.

420
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:06,911
- It gets old.
- Sorry.

421
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,492
Oh, give it a rest.

422
00:23:14,596 --> 00:23:16,091
How was dinner?

423
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:19,127
Cuddy did not mention cancer.

424
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:21,168
She lost her nerve.

425
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,607
It was a date.

426
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,265
What are you doing?

427
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:28,020
PCR test.

428
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:32,526
You're doing it yourself?
In the middle of the night.

429
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:35,559
On a spoon.

430
00:23:36,588 --> 00:23:38,048
Cuddy's spoon.

431
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:40,870
I'm checking her saliva
for cancer markers.

432
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,913
Yeah...

433
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:46,479
I do that
after all my dates too.

434
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:49,579
People think
you're the nice one.

435
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,710
Why are you so
worried about Cuddy?

436
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,084
You go first.

437
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,430
You desperately
want this to be a date.

438
00:23:56,514 --> 00:23:59,092
Because the alternative
is cancer.

439
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:00,901
Just admit
that you like her.

440
00:24:01,003 --> 00:24:02,502
She's smart, funny.

441
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,551
Got a zesty bod.

442
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:07,669
It's great you can look
beyond the fact she's the devil.

443
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:10,041
I stole a spoon.
You stole her garbage.

444
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,801
She's my boss.

445
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,232
She gets sick,
the hospital might replace her.

446
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:16,458
Especially if she dies.

447
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:19,251
I'd have to learn
how to manipulate someone new.

448
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:21,600
Whoa.

449
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:23,316
I think I'm gonna cry.

450
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:25,958
Find me when
the results come in.

451
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,675
Mr. Mason...

452
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,317
because of the damage
done to your son's kidneys,
his potassium is climbing.

453
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,910
It's causing
irregular heartbeats.

454
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:46,272
I'm doubling the meds
and starting him on dialysis.

455
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:49,441
Unless we get
his potassium down...

456
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:53,643
he's gonna have
a heart attack.

457
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:58,709
Kara, just another few minutes.

458
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,809
Biopsy's back.
She's negative for
myelomatous meningitis.

459
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:04,914
And she's not seizing.

460
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,548
So we're wrong
and House is wrong.

461
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,383
And you're okay with that?

462
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,982
[The alarm beeping]
She's seizing.

463
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:17,782
She's not doing anything.

464
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,978
Brain activity isn't accelerating.
It's slowing down.

465
00:25:25,414 --> 00:25:28,987
Cameron:
Muscle rigidity, involuntary grasping
and sucking motions.

466
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:31,105
She's in an encephalopathic delirium.

467
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:35,206
Mmm, a genuine physiological illness.

468
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:36,784
That rules outa few things.

469
00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:38,075
Like what, I wonder?

470
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:40,956
Postpartum psychosisand conversion disorder.

471
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:43,998
Thing about being a good loser...
you're still a loser.

472
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,344
Ouch.

473
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:49,598
The delirium means her brain is shutting down,
reverting to its most instinctual functions.

474
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:52,778
Since it's progressing, maybe
we can assume it's progressive.

475
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,959
Which means it won't be long before
the brain closes shop altogether.

476
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:57,789
Ideas?

477
00:25:58,343 --> 00:26:00,976
[The alarms beeping]

478
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,869
He's in V Fib!

479
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:05,229
Potassium's still too high.

480
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,851
No pulse.
Get him off the machine.

481
00:26:13,454 --> 00:26:14,790
Charge at 10.

482
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,128
Clear.

483
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:19,245
Still in V Fib.

484
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:22,142
Another amp of epi.

485
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:29,034
Damn it, Chase shouldn't
be wasting his time in NICU.

486
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,676
Could be Wernicke's.

487
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:35,024
No, treatment for Wernicke's is thiamine.
We gave her that together with the pheno.

488
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:38,130
Delirium points to lithium.
I know we didn't find any, but--

489
00:26:38,214 --> 00:26:40,538
She's have to be smuggling it in
to be getting sicker.

490
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:42,865
Whipple's causes
encephalopathic delirium.

491
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,017
Test was negative.

492
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,340
The test could have
been wrong.

493
00:26:45,424 --> 00:26:47,645
Ideas are not soda cans.

494
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,528
Recycling sucks.

495
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:51,415
We need something new and shiny.

496
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:57,123
Or go retro. Take an old idea,
shine it up, add a new symptom.

497
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:00,283
Encephalopathic delirium.

498
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,937
Pellagra.

499
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,044
She drinks.
Alcoholics get pellagra.

500
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,899
They eat lousy diets,
so no niacin.

501
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:10,741
He agrees with me.
What a shock.

502
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:13,497
Well, you're right.
Lack of niacin starves the brain.

503
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,537
Neurons shut down, causes seizures,
encephalopathic delirium, and psychosis.

504
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:21,258
We give Kara niacin,
she'll come out of her delirium
and she'll be totally sane.

505
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:24,050
Don't think she's ever gonna
be sane again.

506
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:28,543
Her son just died.

507
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,060
How do you feel?

508
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,026
Um...

509
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:06,487
My... stomach kind of hurts.

510
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:09,786
I need to ask you some questions.
See how you're doing.

511
00:28:09,851 --> 00:28:11,392
Mm-hmm.

512
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:14,256
Tell me your name.

513
00:28:14,463 --> 00:28:15,776
Kara Mason.

514
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,645
Is my son here?

515
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:20,368
When were you born?

516
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:23,886
Please... where's Michael?
Is he okay?

517
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:26,181
Do you hear any other voices
besides mine?

518
00:28:26,265 --> 00:28:28,376
No! Answer me.

519
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:31,163
You've been suffering
from delusions.

520
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,385
They were caused
by a vitamin deficiency: pellagra.

521
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:37,527
It made you believe
things that were not real.

522
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:41,493
Like the voices.

523
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:46,682
I, uh...

524
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:55,167
remember doing things to Mikey.

525
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:57,731
Were those real?

526
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,507
I'm afraid so.

527
00:29:06,484 --> 00:29:08,823
So I...

528
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:13,521
You tried
to suffocate your son.

529
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,499
But I...

530
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:20,270
you...
you stopped me.

531
00:29:20,606 --> 00:29:22,330
And, uh...

532
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:27,025
that other doctor.
He got Mikey breathing.

533
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:31,357
Your son's organs were
damaged too severely.

534
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:36,393
He passed away
this morning.

535
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:43,075
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

536
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:45,309
No!

537
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:51,884
Oh, my God! No!
Oh, my God.

538
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,791
Foreman:
Pellagra doesn't cause
bloody vomit.

539
00:29:58,976 --> 00:30:00,273
She's still sick,
and getting worse.

540
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:05,281
House:
So what causes pellagra
and crimson spew?

541
00:30:05,343 --> 00:30:06,547
Whack!

542
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,496
Dead baby, while sad,
not our problem.

543
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,313
I should have given him
more polystyrene.

544
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,256
You killed him.

545
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,253
If you don't get over it,
you're gonna kill mama too.

546
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:17,485
Cameron:
Her alcoholism caused the pellagra.
Maybe it also explains the vomiting.

547
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:20,630
- Gastritis.
- Gastritis meds aren't helping.

548
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:23,026
Which may confirm her story
she only slipped once.

549
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,564
You remove the drinking from the equation,
internal bleeding, hypercalcemia,
seizure, and pellagra are all back in.

550
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:32,085
Chase, will you get your head
out of the dead baby's butt
and focus on the barely alive--

551
00:30:36,238 --> 00:30:38,123
How much polystyrene
did you give the kid?

552
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:39,581
1 gram.

553
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:42,678
His potassium just kept rising.

554
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:01,656
I need your son.

555
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:05,376
Who are you?

556
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:07,790
Your wife's doctor.

557
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:10,116
Your son may have had
the same condition she does.

558
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,939
My son didn't have a condition.

559
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:13,922
She killed him.

560
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:17,400
If I biopsy her intestine,
she'll bleed out.

561
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,846
He obviously won't.

562
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,421
You're not using
my son's body to help her.

563
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:29,400
Okay. How about
trading him for a beer?

564
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:32,677
Or maybe you're
more of a whisky guy.

565
00:31:33,853 --> 00:31:36,774
You didn't have
strep or a stomach bug
the morning you came in.

566
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:39,140
You puked because
you were hung over.

567
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:43,322
Accuse a recovered drunkof slipping,
most of the time, you'd be right.

568
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:45,347
So I drink.

569
00:31:45,748 --> 00:31:47,347
You're acting like
this is my fault.

570
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,232
People are gonna
feel sorry for you.

571
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:53,454
They'll tell you that you can't
anticipate the unthinkable.
The fact is, you can.

572
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,409
It's just not all that pleasant.

573
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,502
You don't know
anything about--

574
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:58,589
I know that people don't get
crazy enough to kill someone

575
00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:01,646
without first being crazy enough
for someone to notice.

576
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:05,614
How many times
did you go out for a drink
because she was crying?

577
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:08,101
How many times
did you stay at work because

578
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:11,084
you couldn't listen to her telling you
what a bad mother she is?

579
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:14,305
You were relieved
when she shut down.

580
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:17,796
Just sat staring
for hours at a time.

581
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:22,743
She held the pillow over his head.
You slept while she went nuts.

582
00:32:22,827 --> 00:32:25,298
- Not exactly a draw, but--
- What is wrong with you?

583
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:28,548
What kind of a person
says those things now.

584
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:32,220
Let me do the test.

585
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:35,445
It'll be one less thing
for you to feel crappy about.

586
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:48,025
Got a dead baby
for you to biopsy.

587
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:49,215
Let Cameron do it.

588
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,420
You love working NICU?

589
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,173
I could get you transferred.

590
00:32:53,257 --> 00:32:55,758
I told you, I just
wanted to trust patients.

591
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,281
You don't give a crap
about patients.

592
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,246
Your paycheck.

593
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:07,746
You've been double-dipping.

594
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,840
Taking your vacation time here
while drawing a salary in NICU.

595
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,646
Strange.
Rich boy doing all that
for some extra cash.

596
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,165
I'm not rich.

597
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:21,054
But your dad was.

598
00:33:21,106 --> 00:33:22,619
Now he's dead.

599
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:25,864
If you're not rich,
that means that daddy cut you out.

600
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:29,111
I'm not rich.

601
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:31,878
Don't let it change you.

602
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:36,299
And do the test.

603
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:44,795
"Over Yonder"
by The American Boy Choir

604
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:57,958
God of confession,
take Michael into your arms.

605
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:01,458
Welcome him into paradise

606
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:06,496
where there'll be no sorrow,
no weeping, and no pain.

607
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,764
Peace and joy forever more.

608
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:16,085
I'm sorry.

609
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:40,596
It was a date.

610
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,923
Cuddy's negative
for all cancer markers.

611
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:45,044
It was a date.

612
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:52,723
Baby's intestines shows
light villous atrophy.

613
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,889
Why would a baby
have flattened villi?

614
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:03,038
He was being treated
with polystyrene.

615
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,384
- Polystyrene shouldn't--
- It didn't.

616
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:08,436
Question is, what did they use
in the NICU to bind it together?

617
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,572
- Wheat gluten.
- That's great stuff.

618
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,908
Unless your body
can't tolerate it.

619
00:35:13,484 --> 00:35:16,353
The baby didn't have colic,
he had celiac disease?

620
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:18,081
Just like mom.

621
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:21,567
Celiac can be triggered
by all kinds of stress.

622
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:24,603
Bills, childbirth,
drunk husband.

623
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:29,373
Every time she had a bowl of pasta or
a slice of bread or a slosh of soy sauce,

624
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:32,010
her small intestine
became more damaged.

625
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:35,199
Less able to absorb the vitamins
and minerals into her bloodstream.

626
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,172
Her body couldn't
absorb enough niacin.
Caused the pellagra.

627
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:40,690
Couldn't absorb Vitamin K.
Caused the bleeding.

628
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:44,431
And celiac is why
the baby's meds didn't work.

629
00:35:45,692 --> 00:35:48,144
His body just
couldn't absorb them.

630
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:51,567
Switch mom to IV nutrition.

631
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:54,138
It's gluten-free.
It'll spruce her villi right up.

632
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:58,612
No, celiac causes
nutritional deprivation.
Our patient has excess calcium.

633
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,609
Tell them what causes
excess calcium.

634
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,165
With a chaser of bloody vomit.

635
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:08,196
Celiac patients are susceptible
to cancer of the stomach lining.

636
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,794
- She has MALT lymphoma.
- Well, she's your patient now.

637
00:36:14,524 --> 00:36:16,669
And it wasn't a date.

638
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:27,533
You don't have cancer.

639
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:29,254
You don't have dwarfism.

640
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:30,860
You have no proof of that.

641
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,789
I, on the other hand, have this.

642
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:37,886
You ran a PCR on me
without my consent?

643
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,353
Hey, it's good news.

644
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:44,815
Really? It's just hard to access
because of this overwhelming sense
of personal violation.

645
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,132
Deal with it
on your own time.

646
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,933
Bad news...

647
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:52,839
estrogen is too high.

648
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:54,814
No matter how many people
you tell otherwise,

649
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:58,570
I am, and always have been,
a woman. Estrogen is normal.

650
00:36:58,637 --> 00:37:00,022
Not this much.

651
00:37:00,082 --> 00:37:02,147
Not for at least another week.

652
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,410
That's when you ovulate.

653
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:06,506
What?

654
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,841
You monitor my periods?

655
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:13,107
Based on...
when I get bitchy or...

656
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:18,045
Once a month, when
you leave the kids'cancer ward,
your eyes glisten.

657
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:21,045
And about three days later,
you break your ban on sugar and

658
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:25,285
chow down a bucket of frozen yogurt
in the cafeteria, sprinkles included.

659
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:30,601
Based on the last yogurt sighting,
you've got another week before you ovulate.

660
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:34,635
You're on fertility meds.

661
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,071
With red clover
as an herbal booster.

662
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:44,765
And that dinner with Wilsonw
as an audition.

663
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:48,480
It's too bad he didn't land the gig.
He would have had fun.

664
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:51,451
I was considering a donation.

665
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,173
Not a party.

666
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:55,185
So...

667
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:58,504
When is our... "dinner"?

668
00:38:02,928 --> 00:38:05,228
Ooh, he's gonna be
so disappointed.

669
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,612
Right. You two are gonna have
a lot of fun with this.

670
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:12,030
Your patient won't
let me touch her.

671
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:21,088
I killed my son.

672
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,097
Is it my turn to say
something obvious now?

673
00:38:28,677 --> 00:38:31,123
Oh, I know.
You were insane.

674
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:33,595
I did it.
I chose to do it.

675
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,296
Yeah, like diabetics choose
to not produce insulin.

676
00:38:38,957 --> 00:38:42,796
Listen, someone got sick.
Someone died.

677
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:45,000
It happens every day.

678
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:48,959
The only difference in this case is...
it wasn't the same someone.

679
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:50,944
I could have stopped.

680
00:38:51,948 --> 00:38:54,673
I didn't have to
listen to those voices.

681
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:58,258
Spoken like a true sane person.

682
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,920
This is not your fault.

683
00:39:02,046 --> 00:39:03,940
You're healthy now.

684
00:39:04,732 --> 00:39:07,033
Except for the cancer.

685
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:14,169
Those voices...
felt as real to me as...
as Michael's hand.

686
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:17,934
Right here,
when he nursed.

687
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:21,672
And... the smell of his hair.

688
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:30,755
You do not...
deserve to die.

689
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,852
Maybe.

690
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:42,859
I don't wanna live.

691
00:39:53,196 --> 00:39:54,379
She said no.

692
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:56,811
So we gether declared unstable,
appoint a medical proxy.

693
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,038
She was unstable.
Now she's sane.

694
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:00,765
She's entitled
to refuse the treatment.

695
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:02,730
You have to change her mind.
You can't just walk away.

696
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:06,072
Fine! Go on in there and tell her
that every day is a blessing.

697
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,819
"So you killed your baby.
Shake it off. Think positive.
At least you're alive."

698
00:40:12,694 --> 00:40:13,917
Hmm.

699
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:16,272
Kind of hard to sell
when you don't believe it, huh?

700
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:17,564
And you never believed it.

701
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,294
You just wanted all that crap
you went through to mean something.

702
00:40:20,372 --> 00:40:22,539
Well, it didn't mean anything.
It never does.

703
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,439
Welcome back.

704
00:40:26,161 --> 00:40:28,965
Why are you doing this to me?
I was happy.

705
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:31,068
You were aspiring to be content.

706
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:34,990
Don't give mea semantic argument.
I was content with the way things were!

707
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:36,197
That's what happiness is.

708
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:40,102
Yeah, if we were all
just satisfied with what we had,
what a beautiful world it would be.

709
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:44,207
We'd all slowly
starve to death in our own filth,
but at least we'd be happy.

710
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:47,614
Listen, I need your self-worth
to hang on this job.

711
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:50,356
For kicking ass here to be all that
lets you rise above miserable.

712
00:40:50,463 --> 00:40:53,034
If waking up in the morning
is enough, I don't need you.

713
00:40:53,673 --> 00:40:55,505
I can live with that.

714
00:40:57,233 --> 00:41:00,630
No, you can't.
Not anymore.

715
00:41:28,264 --> 00:41:31,109
If you got treatment,
then maybe we could...

716
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:46,252
When you see Mikey...

717
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:51,897
Tell him
his dad says he's sorry.

718
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:04,842
Hi.

719
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:09,878
- Night. - Night.
- Good night.

720
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:15,034
Did you tell Cuddy
we tested her for cancer?

721
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,043
Yeah.

722
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:17,291
And?

723
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,566
It wasn't a date.

724
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,508
Turned out
she had some skin lesions.

725
00:42:23,592 --> 00:42:26,351
Guess there was
no genetic predisposition.

726
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,070
You TiVo The L Word?
