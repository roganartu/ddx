I'm fine.

00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:57,061
Can I do anything to help you?

14
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:59,719
Just go back to sleep.
I wanna go get a glass of wine.

15
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:02,154
- I can keep you company.
- You have work in the morning.

Are you sure?
You don't want me to...

17
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:06,255
I'll be right back.
Just sleep.

Hannah?

19
00:01:22,418 --> 00:01:23,794
Hannah?

20
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:37,058
What'd you do?

21
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:40,005
I just wanted to sleep.

Complicated case.

30
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:41,427
I'm a night owl.

31
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,054
Wilson's an early bird.

32
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:44,594
We are different species.

33
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,068
Then move him into his own cage.

34
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,562
Who'll clean the droppings for mine?

35
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,274
25 year old female,
with sleep issues.

36
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:55,286
I guess she's...

37
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:57,315
Oh, what's the medical term?

38
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:58,718
Upset.

39
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,425
25-year-old females are usually
completely rational, they rocks, really.

40
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:05,558
Aghhh...

41
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:09,245
My theory seems to be supported by the fact
she swallowed a bottle of sleepng pills.

42
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:11,967
Get her a shrink.
I need some shut-eye.

43
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,706
She's a little bit more than upset.

44
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:17,043
She hasn't slept in 10 days.

45
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:18,678
She's lying.

46
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,199
Without REM sleep
your neurons stop regenerating.

47
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,581
Your brain shuts down lobe by lobe.

48
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:27,909
She'd be insane after 5 days,
dead by 10.

49
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,234
Give me a little credit.
I know what gets you off.

50
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,155
She took the pills to sleep,
not to kill herself.

51
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:35,536
Clever alibi.

52
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:36,720
They didn't work.

53
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,798
She stayed awake even though
she downed the whole bottle.

54
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,387
And the longest anyone's ever
survived without sleep is 11 days.

55
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:50,753
Which gives you 22 hours.

56
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,338
You stole my article.

57
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,297
I wouldn't do that.

58
00:03:57,298 --> 00:04:01,085
I wrote up the case where we induced
hyperthermic cardiac arrest
in the terminal cancer girl.

59
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,063
I wrote my own.
I didn't steel yours.

60
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:05,167
You knew I was writing one.
You gave me notes.

61
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:07,939
Got a case.

62
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,114
It can wait.
You two finish.

63
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:14,440
5 bucks says someone loses an eye.

64
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,572
Fine. You're only putting off the inevitable.

65
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:21,937
25-year-old female,
hasn't slept for 10 days.

66
00:04:21,938 --> 00:04:24,919
I assume the ER tried
giving her some sedatives.
We should up the dosage.

67
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,473
Sedation isn't the same as sleep.

68
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,612
Thanks for your insight.

69
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:30,454
For someone who hasn't slept in 10 days,
sedation is a great start.

70
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:31,830
Sleep is an active process.

71
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,262
Reboots the system, restores the brain.
Sedatives don't--

72
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,290
The brain is being stressed;
we need to relieve that.

73
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,017
You've had my article on your desk
for the last 4 months.

74
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,608
I'm a very slow reader.

75
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:43,529
No fever, no white count
means no infection.

76
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:44,811
Schizophrenia?

77
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:45,808
No delusions.

78
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,087
You read his.

79
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:50,064
Signed it, didn't read it.

80
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:53,187
Aside from the sleeping pills,
tox screen was clean.

81
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:56,253
No cocaine, methamphetamines
or diet pills.

82
00:04:56,338 --> 00:05:01,885
Only medicatiosn she's had recently are
Steroids for poison ivy and ibuprofen
for a knee she hurt skiing.

83
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,726
Nothing that would cause sleep disturbances.

84
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:07,226
- When did you get his article
- Uh... about 3 weeks ago.

85
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,679
Let's go back to the beginning.

86
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:10,715
How far back?

87
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:12,968
Genesis.

88
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:16,904
God said, "Let there be light".

89
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,833
Sleep is initially contrlled
by external light cues.

90
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,284
And if her brain can't
interpret those cues...

91
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,683
Optic nerve disease.

92
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,529
I'm sensing another article.

93
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:29,633
I'll go run the test.

94
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:36,861
I'm injecting a dye
which will allow us to take a look
at your retina and your optic nerve.

95
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:38,817
Everything's  kinda blurry.

96
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:42,144
Normal, because of the dye,
it's gonna be that way next few hours.

97
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:50,120
Need a hand?

98
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:51,029
No.

99
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,913
We're never gonna work together again?

100
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:56,799
Just don't see the need to
make you feel better by forgiving you.

101
00:05:57,673 --> 00:06:00,495
I wasn't asking for forgiveness.
I was asking if you needed help.

102
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:05,243
It's unprofessional to be talking
about this in front of the patient.
Myabe that doesn't matter to you, but...

103
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:08,758
Doesn't matter.
She's not listening..

104
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,998
She's asleep.

105
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,676
Normal stage one brain waves.

106
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:17,155
Maybe she's... better?

107
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,008
Still blurry.

108
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:23,176
You fell asleep.

109
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:24,739
No, I didn't.

110
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:28,802
Negative for optic nerve desease.

111
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:30,006
But she sleeps.

112
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,788
For like 10 seconds,
maximum 1 minute.

113
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:36,234
We also checked the ocular pressure.
It's normal.

114
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:38,655
And she doesn't know she sleeps.

115
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:41,151
Brain  is often aware of stage one sleep.

116
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:45,251
CT showed no tumers, no clots,
no seizure disorder.

117
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:49,394
So  she sleeps.
She just can't stay asleep.

118
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,700
You going somewhere with this.

119
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,791
You know what keeps me awake at night?

120
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:55,774
"Monsters in the closet".

121
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:58,057
There's no monster in the closet.
We looked.

122
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,405
Well, it's certainly not showing up on the scans.

123
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:02,535
Where's Cameron?

124
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:07,364
She felt I could deliver the news on my own.

125
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,262
Oh, this is going to work out great.

126
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:14,602
Come on.

127
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:21,256
If you two guys can't play nice together,
I'll take away your toys.

128
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,137
I don't care whose fault this is.

129
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:26,250
- If you hadn't...
- Especially, I don't care if it was my fault.

130
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:29,918
Whatever this woman has,
it's not showing upon our tests,

131
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,458
which means she's sick.

132
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,017
Just not sick enough for us to see it.

133
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,997
You want us make her sicker?

134
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,082
Yes.

135
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,590
I wanna stress her body.
Specifically her brain.

136
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:41,724
Keep her awake.

137
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:45,667
Depriving her of even
the 5 minutes of sleep
she does have-- it's torture.

138
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,600
So is cutting people with knives,

139
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:50,023
but you can totally get away with that
if you havea doctor coat on.

140
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:53,279
House, those few seconds of sleep
maybe the only reason she 's still alive.

141
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,807
More symptom we can force out her,
the more tests we can do

142
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,990
The more tests we do,
the more information we get,
the quicker we make a diagnosis.

143
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:02,580
See how much more fun it is
when you guys get along?

144
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:05,675
You two take the first 4 hours.

145
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,103
Hannah?

146
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,901
Hannah!

147
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,109
You fell asleep.

148
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,345
No, I didn't.

149
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:24,910
Your brain doesn't remember.
It was just a few seconds.

150
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,252
Max:
Is this really necessary?

151
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:30,142
The sooner we find out what's wrong,
the sooner she can get a real night's rest.

152
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:31,571
Hannah?

153
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:33,857
Hannah?

154
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,057
Hannah?

155
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:39,473
Ow.

156
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:41,434
What did you do that for?

157
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,078
- You fell asleep again.
- No, I didn't.

158
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:46,433
- We are sorry.
- We have to do this.

159
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,760
We don't have to be cruel.

160
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,679
You know what happens
when you're nice. Nothing.

161
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:54,403
That's how you define "nice"?
Not "stealing"?

162
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,110
Doctors!

163
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,226
Foreman:
She fall asleep again?

164
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,011
[Snores]

165
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,373
We got rectal bleeding.

166
00:09:16,374 --> 00:09:17,743
What, all of you?

167
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:23,127
So monster is peeking out
from under the bed.

168
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:27,112
Which either means
she has a clotting disorder
or she has a tumer in her colon.

169
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:29,028
Chase:
I'll do a colonoscopy.

170
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:31,113
Who's keeping her awake now?

171
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:33,634
We figured once we found another symptom,
it really didn't matter.

172
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,124
Yeah, he's got all the ideas.

173
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,572
Who is with her?

174
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:39,364
Her partner's donating blood,
so she's with a nurse.

175
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,689
Probably singing her lullabies.
I want her awake.

176
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,021
You have to sedate a patient
to do a colonoscopy.

177
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:47,474
Why? Just because of the pain?

178
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:53,256
If you find a tumar in her colon,
you can knock her out.
If you don't, she stays awake.

179
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:59,020
Aghhh! God! It hurts.

180
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:01,798
- Can't you hurry?
- Trust me. You don't want me to hurry.

181
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,010
God, you're killing me.
[Moaning]

182
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:06,335
Hold my hand.

183
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,156
Keep breathing, nice and steady.

184
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,827
How am I supposed to work with him?

185
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:18,464
Um, maybe we shouldn't be
talking about this right now?

186
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,728
You think I'm overreacting?

187
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:24,741
Um, I need you to relax your anus.

188
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:29,479
We are not here.
We are skiing.

189
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:32,149
It's Thanksgiving, at Vail.

190
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,983
You want me to think about
nearly killing myself
on a snowboard?

191
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,830
Come on, you never fell.

192
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:40,698
You were awesome.

193
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:46,463
Is that what you told him?
I'm hysterical, and I need to relax my anus?

194
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:51,102
I told him-- how many cases
do we work up in the year?

195
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:53,564
They're all weird; he could've
written up any one of them.

196
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:56,067
She's bleeding.

197
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:59,007
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe!

198
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,340
Hold on.

199
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:09,953
We packed her nose to control the bleed
and started transfusing 2 units of whole blood.

200
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,621
The pathologyfrom the rectal bleed
showed traces of nasal epithelium.

201
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,730
So, the butt bleed's
just a nose bleed.

202
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:18,205
That much blood is
not a "just a" anything.

203
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:21,089
When two people fight this much,

204
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:22,237
You know what it means?

205
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:26,105
It's gotta be a massive sinus hemorrhage
that was draining down her throat and out the back.

206
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:27,897
The question isn't what, it's why.

207
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:29,218
Oh, get a room.

208
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,365
Rat poison mixed with
some sort of neurogenic toxin could
cause bleeding and sleep disturbances.

209
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,383
Do you have a specific type
of neurogenic toxin in mind,

210
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,473
or should we just start running
a thousand different tox screens?

211
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:39,946
Just pretend I'm not here.
I'll be reading.

212
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:41,852
It could also be
some type of coagulopathy.

213
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,914
Or could be us. Do you have any idea
what it feels like to have a 6-foot-long hose
shoved into your large intestine?

214
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:52,665
No, but I now havea much greater respect for
whichever basketball player you dated in college.

215
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:56,074
We've basically been torturing this girl
for the last eight hours.

216
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,442
We've been poking her foot,
not punching her face.

217
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:01,460
Extreme stress can cause
high blood pressure
which can cause bleeding.

218
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,921
Wouldn't keep her awake for 10 days.

219
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:07,448
What if the poison ivy...
wasn't poison ivy.

220
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:13,465
She got the rash that was diagnosed
as poison ivy around the same time
the insomnia started.

221
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:18,498
Rash + nose bleed + sleep distuvance
equals Wegener's Granulomatosis.

222
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:20,638
Start corticosteroid treatment.

223
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,482
The poison ivy treatment was steroids.

224
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:23,664
Much lower dosage.

225
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:25,999
Get her back on the juice,
triple the dose.

226
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:30,240
Get a c-ANCA and upper airway biopsy
to confirm Wegener's.

227
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,777
[Mutters something in Mandarin]

228
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:45,031
She has, uh, menstrual problems.

229
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:48,112
They are really bad.
The pain keeps her in bed all day.

230
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:50,461
Plus she's super depressed.

231
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:58,380
She said super depressed?

232
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:02,678
She heard that birth control pills
can make her feel better.

233
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,241
She wants birth control pills

234
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:07,718
- for her PMS (premenstrual syndrome).
- I guess.

235
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:12,965
Judging by the redness around
your mom's nostrils and the tissue,

236
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,876
she's got conveniently stashed inside her wrist
and I'd say her problem is more likely a URI.

237
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:18,820
Not a PMS.

238
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:22,121
- URI?
- Upper Respiratory Infection.

239
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:23,313
A cold.

240
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,127
I don't think so.

241
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,433
I also think she's got a problem with SAC.

242
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:28,558
SAC?

243
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,847
Thanks for palying.
Stupid American Child.

244
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:34,107
If you want the pill,

245
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:38,604
all you have to do is
to walk into any health clinic
in Jersey alone and ask for it.

246
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,656
What exactly was your plan?

247
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:43,987
Were you going to exchange
the birth control pills for some

248
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:48,326
over-the-counter-decongestants
and hope that your mom's cold
lasts another 6 years?

249
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,495
No.

250
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:55,128
- Is that for her cold?
- No, that's for your ovaries.

251
00:13:55,954 --> 00:13:58,636
I assume you haven't had a stroke.
Have you had a blood clot?

252
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,014
No.

253
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:01,304
Super.

254
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,074
Each 3 months when you need a refill,
take a bus to a free clinic.

255
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,858
Don't wait around hoping
for Mom to get another sniffle.

256
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:12,076
Not the sharpest chopstick
in the drower, is she?

[Says something in Mandarin]

258
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:16,215
Was this just one of your experiments?

259
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:19,160
You just wanted to see how I'd react
being screwed over by Foreman?

260
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,205
Nice idea, but no.

261
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:24,677
It was just good old-fashioned laziness.

262
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:27,617
Gotta hand it to Foreman, though.

263
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:30,438
He knew that you're a suck-up
and I don't give a crap.

264
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,535
He successfully exploited us both.

265
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,613
Right. We're both victims.

266
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,569
A simple heads up,
that's all I needed.

267
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:41,330
Maybe between your incredibly witty remarks
about anal sex and Cuddy's breasts
You could have tip me off.

268
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,438
Then I'd have Foreman pissed at me,

269
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,686
and as annoying as you could be,

270
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:48,216
at least, you're not gonna
pop a cap in my ass.

271
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,293
Witty, huh?

272
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:55,744
You, on the other hand,

273
00:14:55,797 --> 00:15:00,426
continue to be flabbergasted
every time someone actually
acts like a human being.

274
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:04,129
Foreman did what he did
'cause it worked out best that way for him.

275
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:06,100
That's what everyone does.

276
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,364
That is not the definition of being human.

277
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:11,190
That's the definition of being an ass.

278
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:17,266
This will numb you up.

279
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,140
And  this will keep
your tongue out of the way.

280
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:28,140
Don't worry,
you shouldn't feel anything
except for slight pulling.

281
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:29,957
So you think I was out of line?

282
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,582
That article would set on House's desk
for the next 6 years.

283
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,918
I  could have told her.

284
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:37,734
You could've written it for too.

285
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,711
She knows House as well as any of us.

286
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:43,421
You should've known
she was waiting for to do
something she was never gonna do.

Hannah, sill with us?

289
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:54,283
What's wrong with her eyes?

290
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:55,471
Foreman:
It looks like REM.

291
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:57,434
- What's that?
- Rapid Eye Movements.

292
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:58,887
That's what your eyes do
when you're sleeping.

293
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:00,075
But she's awake.

00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,487
Hannah, can you hear me?

296
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:06,390
Yeah, off course.

297
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:09,629
Was she sitting up or lying down?

298
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,618
- Sitting up.
- Then It wasn't REM.

299
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,917
Chase says her eyes are moving the exact way.

300
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,170
Did you start her on Steroids?

301
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,302
- Not yet. We were still doing the--
- But she wasn't sleeping.

302
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:18,092
How do you know?

303
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,922
'Cause we haven't done anything yet.

304
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:25,755
She may be able to sleep with her eyes open
but unless you also discovered she's got
two extra tits and her hooves for feet.

305
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:29,682
There's no way she'd be able to
maintain enough muscle tensity
during REM sleep to sit upright.

306
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,119
It's a movement disdorder,

307
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,137
which rules out Wegener's.

308
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,153
Where's Foreman?

309
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:37,171
- Keeping her awake.
- Good.

310
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:41,043
Rabies could cause muscle spasms,
malaise, anxiety and wakefulness.

311
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:43,577
Pretty unlikely she forget
being bitten by a crazed animal.

312
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:45,054
She could've been exposed
through an open wound.

313

She have a dog?

314
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:49,104
For less than a week.
She had an allergic reaction,
so they had to give it away.

315
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:49,844
Allergies?

316
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:52,640
Animal allergies seemed unlikely
but it's possible that--

317
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,626
- When?
- When what?

318
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:56,678
When did she get rid of the dog?

319
00:16:56,763 --> 00:16:59,659
About a month ago.
Her girlfriend gave it to her
for her birthday.

320
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:02,520
Well, then it's not allergies.

321
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:05,305
She's  just leaving her girlfrined.

322
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:09,720
You... spoke to the dog?

323
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:13,969
If her birthday was a month ago,
she would've still been on steroids
for the poison ivy.

324
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,075
Those meds would've
suppressed any reaction
she might've had to the dog.

325
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,016
Which means she lied
about being allergic.

326
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,356
Dog's a commitment.

327
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:23,189
You pretend to be allergic
because you don't wanna
tell your girlfriend

328
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:25,171
that you're not planning
on being around that long.

329
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,738
So I think we can move
onto options other than allergies.

330
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,106
We should still do a scratch test.
If she's allergic to one thing--

331
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:33,166
She is not allergic.

332
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:39,029
Okay. Well, we could either base our diagnosis
on your admittedly keen understanding
of lesbian relationships,

333
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:41,631
or we could do a scratch test.

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,718
No, I'm okay.

343
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,409
Come on, that can't taste good.
I'm gonna get you a soda.

344
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,162
- It's okay, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

345
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,748
You and Max seem to have
a really nice relationship.

346
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:18,778
- Yeah.
- She's very supportive.

347
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:20,251
Uh-huh.

348
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:26,944
When Max got you the dog,
did you lie about having
an allergic reaction?

349
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,023
No.

350
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:32,624
Why?

351
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,218
If you have pre-existing conditions,
it's important we know.

352
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:38,290
But if you don't,
it's just as important.

353
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:43,031
- If I'm wasting my time doing this allergy test--
- You're not gonna tell her, are you?

354
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:46,301
It's none of my business.

355
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,426
She's a good person and then...

356
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,038
We've just been
together so long, I...

357
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,363
I'm tired of her.

358
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,523
Sounds terrible, doesn't it?

359
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:06,387
I guess it happens sometimes.

360
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:09,236
Oh, my back hurts.

361
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:17,102
Hannah, can you turn over?

362
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:18,330
What's wrong?

363
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,717
I'm not sure.

364
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,233
Oh, my God.

365
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:30,934
She has massive internal bleeding.

366
00:19:30,974 --> 00:19:32,305
Chase:
Did she have access to aspirin?

367
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,632
She'd have to take a hell of a lot.

368
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:36,026
Why not, considering
her current mental state.

369
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:38,921
What about her mental state?

370
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:42,090
You were right about her
wanting to break up.

371
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,509
That just means I was right,
doesn't mean she's suicidal.

372
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,878
A bottle of pills is
what landed her here
in the first place.

373
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,364
Sleeping pills.

374
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,560
God knows why
she'd want them.

375
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,777
What else can cause
sleep disorder
and internal bleeding?

376
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:57,642
Drugs or alcohol can
mess with the sleeping
and compromise the liver.

377
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,813
What are you doing here?
Who's keeping her awake?

378
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:01,885
Doesn't matter.

379
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:04,418
Liver function tests
are through the sky.

380
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,052
Liver's not compromised,
it's dead.

381
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:10,073
She doesn't need a diagnosis,
she needs a new liver.

382
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:14,312
She's not getting a new liver
unless we can figure out
what's wrong with her.

383
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:16,993
Test for cirrhosis: 12 hours.
Test for hepatitis: 8.

384
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:18,479
Her liver's not gonna
last another 6.

385
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,319
So your advice is
we just give up?

386
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:26,656
My advice is that we narrow our focus
to conditions that we can diagnose treat,
and cure in less than 6 hours.

387
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:29,577
And there's nothing on that list.

388
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:34,545
The girlfriend donated blood, right?

389
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:36,349
Yeah, so?

390
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:38,471
It means that
they're the same type.

391
00:20:39,516 --> 00:20:42,808
You can't ask
the person she's about to dump
to donate half her liver.

392
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:45,420
It does seem tacky, doesn't it?

393
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:56,387
I'm Dr. Hosue.

394
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:58,376
I'm in charge of your case.

395
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:00,870
What's going on?

396
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:03,752
How come no one is
keeping her awake anymore?

397
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:06,442
You're in acute liver failure.

398
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:10,765
We can continue
the transfusions and the lactulose,

399
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:12,681
But it's only a stop-gap.

400
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:17,617
There's really nothing we can do
to stop the toxins from building up
in your bloodstream.

401
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:21,107
Which means that in a few hours

402
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:24,204
you will lapse into a coma...

403
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:27,514
and you won't wake up.

404
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:34,642
I'm sorry.

405
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:39,352
That's it? You are giving up?
You're...

406
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:41,699
not gonna figure out
what's doing this to her?

407
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:46,646
Even with the right diagnosis,
any treatment's gonna take longer
than the time she has left.

408
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:49,628
If it's her liver,
can't she get a transplant?

409
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:52,375
Wouldn't work without a diagnosis.

410
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:55,572
Whatever killed the first liver
would do the same to the second.

411
00:21:55,833 --> 00:22:01,696
But it would-- it would give you more time
to make the diagnosis, to get her better.

412
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:06,365
Well, it might give us
an extra day or two, but...

413
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:11,401
no procurement agency is gonna
let a liver go to a patient
with an undiagnosed, pre-existing--

414
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,179
Hannah and I have
the same blood type.

415
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:16,390
Couldn't I be the donor.

416
00:22:23,832 --> 00:22:27,475
It is medically possible
for us to take a part of your--

417
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,619
Please, I don't care
about the risks.

418
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:43,145
You're very lucky to have
such a devoted partner.

419
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:00,012
I just bought us 36 hours.

420
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:01,835
Differential diagnosis.

421
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:05,877
Which monster eats your liver,
screws up your sleep,
and causes bleeding?

422
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:07,451
Does Max know
Hannah plans to leave her?

423
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,386
Didn't come up.
So I guess no.

424
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,510
If she knew, there's no way
she'd go through with this.

425
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:15,296
And if you didn't have a pathological need
to create a close, personal relationship

426
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,013
with every dying person you meet,
we would be blissfully ignorant
of any ethical dilemmas

427
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,310
and might actually be able to
concentrate on the differential.

428
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:22,631
Scratch test was negative.

429
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:26,712
It's rare, bet any of the hepatitis viruses
could cause sleep disturbances and liver failure.

430
00:23:26,797 --> 00:23:27,927
No, PCRs were normal.

431
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:30,548
- We have an ethical dilemma.
- No, we don't.

432
00:23:31,363 --> 00:23:32,313
Continue.

433
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:36,770
What about splenic cancer or
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
She's the right age.

434
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:39,623
Could explain the bleeding.
Maybe the liver failure.

435
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:43,125
We're withholding information
relevant to her decision
to risk her life.

436
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:44,908
How is that not an ethical dilemma?

437
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:46,817
It's not medical information.

438
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:48,811
- Who cares?
- The AMA.

439
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:51,998
Wilson's disease could explain liver and neurological symptoms.

440
00:23:52,106 --> 00:23:53,611
It also causes bleeding disorders.

441
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:55,467
No Kayser-Fleischer rings
in her eyes.

442
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:57,933
Rings don't have to be there
if there's neurological symptoms.

443
00:23:58,017 --> 00:24:00,495
- This is immoral.
- Look, let's say you're right.

444
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:02,865
We tell, she changes her mind,
our patient dies.

445
00:24:02,949 --> 00:24:04,049
How is that moral?

446
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:06,375
What else?

447
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:10,759
Poison mushrooms can cause
liver failure, sleep disturbances,
and internal bleeding.

448
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:13,128
She's not 'shrooming;
she's a sport's nut.

449
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:15,256
Right. Skiers never party.

450
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:17,654
She's doing this out of love
and Max doesn't know--

451
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:20,449
It's only moral to save a person
if they love you?

452
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:23,810
It's kind of a selfish way
of looking at life.

453
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:26,826
I like Wilson's disease,
like cancer, love mushrooms.

454
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,958
Yeah, but we don't have
the time to test for any of it.

455
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:32,508
Before she can get the transplant,
we need to do about 80 procedures.

456
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:34,991
So do those tests and my tests
at the same time.

457
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:40,630
Use the PET to look for cancer and Wilson's
while you endoscope her bile ducts,
scrape her stomach for mushroom spores.

458
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:46,366
One of you CT her liver,
while the other two check
proteins CA-125 and CA-19.5.

459
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:49,310
Oh yeah,
anyone says anything to Max,

460
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:51,438
they're fired.

461
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:54,962
- We have to.
- We have to not.

462
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:56,372
Because she's not our patient.

463
00:24:56,456 --> 00:24:59,670
She's getting surgery,
she's someone's patient.

464
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:04,449
Calvin and Sam.
Great, thank you.

465
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:06,484
Need a little help.

466
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:10,017
Inexplicable rash
on a patient's scrotum
you need me to look at?

467
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:14,391
27-year-old female wants
to donate half her liver
to her dying girlfriend.

468
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:15,619
That's very generous.

469
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,531
This is sleepless girl?
What's she got?

470
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:19,886
Liver failure.

471
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,140
Sort of figured that out when
you said she needed a new liver.

472
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:27,158
You don't have a diagnosis.

473
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,138
Transplant buys me time.

474
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:32,054
Let's just skip the part
where I say this is insane.

475
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:32,845
It was her idea.

476
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:34,522
If she wants to be an idiot,
it's her call.

477
00:25:34,606 --> 00:25:35,540
You don't need me.

478
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:38,083
Just have one of your team
walk her through the process.

479
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:41,515
The donor and the donee sort of
have opposing interests, right?

480
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,337
You can't really
advise them both.

481
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:46,269
You're concerned
about the ethics of this?

482
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:49,226
What's going on?
What do you know?

483
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,890
Nothing medically relevant.

484
00:25:50,955 --> 00:25:53,331
But you know something,
and it is relevant.

485
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:56,708
If I can't tell her,
I can't really tell you, can I?

486
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:58,950
Not if you're advising her.

487
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:02,223
I assume this information
is in the medical file.

488
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:05,845
- My patient's confidential file.
- This hospital's file.

489
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,891
You can either
satisfy your curiosity,

490
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:13,589
or you can remain ignorant,
do nothing ethically wrong,

491
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:16,960
and my patient doesn't die
in three hours.

492
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:29,519
These tests and the counseling
normally happen over weeks.

493
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:31,257
Sometimes months.

494
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:32,366
It's okay.

495
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,980
Well, the most important part
we're skipping is time--

496
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:39,454
time for you to change your mind.

497
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:41,823
I don't want to change my mind.

498
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:47,061
Not now,
but with time and perspective,
maybe we learn things--

499
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:49,410
If we had the time,
we'd take the time, but we don't.

500
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,332
So can you get this over with?

501
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:58,149
Either I sign off on this,
or it doesn't happen.

502
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,875
So I need you to listen to me.

503
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,958
Because there's a chance
that you will die on that table.

504
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:16,361
I just want me and Hannah
to be able to lie in bed together,

505
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:22,947
as old ladies.
Compare scars.

506
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:33,577
I need you to lie on your side,
and hold your knees.

507
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:42,646
I'm gonna check for vascular abnormalities
that might prevent us from doing the transplant.

508
00:27:42,772 --> 00:27:46,476
At the same time I'm also
checking for mushroom spores
to see if that's the underlying--

509
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,846
I don't do mushrooms.

510
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,975
You lie about your love life,
maybe you lie about drugs. Open.

511
00:27:54,765 --> 00:27:57,463
Aren't you at all concerned about
what Max is going through right now?

512
00:27:57,546 --> 00:27:59,533
They're shoving a tube
up her rectum.

513
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,977
They're gonna swab her stomach,
just like I'm doing.

514
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:03,932
It's going to hurt,
just like this hurts.

515
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:09,099
Which is nothing at all
like the risk she's taking on the table.

516
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,193
You really don't love her, do you?

517
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:15,948
I'm not leaving her
because I don't--

518
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:18,925
I'm not talking about the leaving.
I'm talking about this.

519
00:28:19,342 --> 00:28:22,177
If you care for her at all,
you won't let her do this blind.

520
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:29,345
- You'd really tell.
- Yeah.

521
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:33,455
You'd die.

522
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:44,124
Take it you've seen that.

523
00:28:46,837 --> 00:28:51,322
Seen it, digested it,
watched it blow up
my entire department.

524
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:53,996
- You read Cameron's version?
- Didn't read either.

525
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:55,430
It was good.

526
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:57,407
Better than Foreman's?

527
00:28:57,783 --> 00:29:01,443
Maybe. He was more analytical
about the diagnostic procedures.

528
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:05,447
She concentrated more
on the ethical dilemmas
of informed consent.

529
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,404
How any patient
can really be informed
without a medical degree.

530
00:29:08,488 --> 00:29:10,492
Same old party lines.

531
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:12,468
Foreman should've told her.

532
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:14,681
Oh, shoulda woulda coulda.

533
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:18,772
If you allow this sort of thing
in your department,
you're basically saying it's okay.

534
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:24,910
No, I'm saying that I don't care what they do
as long as my life isn't interrupted
by pointless conversations like this one.

535
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:27,485
They won't trust each other,
and they won't trust you.

536
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,824
They shouldn't.

537
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:35,009
Deception like this is
just one step removed from
actively sabotaging one another.

538
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:36,520
Then what would you do?

539
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:39,867
I could be the kindest,
gentlest boss in the world

540
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:43,007
and Foreman would've still done
what he did because that's who he is.

541
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:46,077
We can only hope that
Cameron has learned something.

542
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:50,579
Right, because you're
all about the teaching.

543
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,857
Our children are the future.

544
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:00,265
Hey.

545
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:03,169
Cuddy cleared Max for surgery.
She's okay to go.

546
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:05,413
- How's our patient?
- She's also cleared.

547
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:08,774
I don't care about the prep.
I care about the diagnostic tests.

548
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:11,259
Well, it looks negative
for Wilson's disease,
we'll know for surein an hour.

549
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,468
- Blood proteins are normal, it's not--
- Where's Cameron?

550
00:30:13,552 --> 00:30:15,398
Taking a sample of the bile duct.

551
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:18,933
Surgeries are supposed
to start in about 15 minutes.

552
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,330
She had a chance to get one last--

553
00:30:20,414 --> 00:30:21,921
Hannah and Max will be
in the same room.

554
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:23,802
You wanted us to do
as much as we can before--

555
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:27,176
They're both awake.
With Cameron.

556
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:34,810
Maybe we should give these two
a minute together before the surgery.

557
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,581
You ready, honey?

558
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:41,610
Max.

559
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:44,519
It's okay.
I'm right here.

560
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:50,164
- I need you to know something.
- I know. I love you, too.

561
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:52,733
I don't know how to say this.

562
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:54,204
Good lord.

563
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,568
You can tell me anything.

564
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:59,898
She hasn't slept in eleven days,
you people trying to torture her?

565
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,642
Ding, ding, let's go.

566
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:13,946
- I told you not--
- I didn't say a word to Max.

567
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,558
This is exactly why
you got screwed with Foreman.

568
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,873
You're looking for people
to do the right thing.

569
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:22,469
She hasn't slept,
her judgment's compromised
due to inactivity in her prefrontal cortex.

570
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:26,581
Oh, she could have
the best prefrontal cortex
in the history of mankind.

571
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:31,654
But given the choice of life versus death,
those bad, bad people are going to choose life.

572
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,309
Then why'd you sedate her?

573
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:38,127
If she wasn't gonna tell,
if she was never gonna do the right thing,
why bother knocking her out?

574
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:42,633
This isn't about them.
If she talks,
if she does the decent thing,

575
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:45,940
then you don't get to solve your puzzle,
your game's over, you lose.

576
00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:49,375
Yeah, I want to save her;
I'm morally bankrupt.

577
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,266
How's it going?

578
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:14,327
They're about to
remove Hannah's liver.

579
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,810
All right, I'm good to go.

580
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:24,345
You can start
removing Max's liver.

581
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:28,890
Cuddy:
You want to let me in on what
the big secret is between these two?

582
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:30,984
You read Foreman's article?

583
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:34,503
It was good.

584
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:38,164
He basically stole it from me.

585
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,063
So?

586
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:42,789

No, this isn't dodgeball.

00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:49,219
What am I supposedto do?
Just sit backand take it?

589
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:51,158
No, write another article.

590
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:56,808
Kick ass, until you're sitting
behind some big expensive desk, and
someone from Johns Hopkins calls and says,

591
00:32:56,895 --> 00:33:00,770
"We're thinking about hiring
Eric Foreman as our Head of Neurology,"

592
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,032
and you can say
whatever you want.

593
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,688
Lovely.
Revenge as motive for success.

594
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:09,736
Well, it doesn't have to be the motive.

595
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,876
But it sure tastes good.

596
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,434
She's in VF.
I've got no pulse!

597
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:15,710
She's arresting.

599
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:21,583
Ugh! I am so relieved
you two are here.

600
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:24,231
Without you looking out,
they'd be playing foosball down there.

601
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:25,453
Max's heart stopped.

602
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:27,722
Your patient is on the other side.

603
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:32,739

or Max has risked her life for nothing.

We're okay.

607
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:55,681
Chase:
Max's cardiac arrest was caused
by hypoxia from hypoventilation.

608
00:33:55,848 --> 00:34:00,772
They restarted her heart and
the right lobe of her liver was
successfully transplanted into Hannah.

609
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:05,837
Now, where were we before
we were so rudely interrupted
by the liver transplant?

610
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:10,414
DOPA decarboxylase was processed normally and
the cerolo-plasmaand copper levels were normal.

611
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:11,506
So no Wilson's disease.

612
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:14,529
Gastric content was negative for spores,
so no mushroom toxicity.

613
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:16,900
And the initial tests
were negative for cancer.

614
00:34:16,962 --> 00:34:18,808
- Which cancer were you looking for?
- Any of them.

615
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:21,592
We ran blood tests for
ovarian, lung, and lymphomas.

616
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:22,739
It's not gonna tell you much.

617
00:34:22,823 --> 00:34:25,046
Her blood was taken after
she was given immunosuppressants.

618
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:29,905
They fight rejection.
They also mess up our ability
to get any clear readings.

00:34:31,509 --> 00:34:34,648
Great battles kick up a lot of dirt.

620
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:39,590
Obscure the battlefield
so generals can't see what's going on.

621
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:43,015
So what are your orders,
General House?

622
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,238
Sound the retreat.

623
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:50,868

00:34:51,804 --> 00:34:53,129
Is Max okay?

625
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:55,863
She's still unconscious,
but her vitals look good.

626
00:34:56,941 --> 00:35:02,462
We need to stop
all the immunosuppressant drugs
which are protecting your new liver.

627
00:35:04,323 --> 00:35:06,627
But if you stop the drugs, I'll die.

628
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:10,736
You're dead anyway
if we don't figure out
what caused all this.

629

By removing any outside influences,
it'll help us see what's
really going on with your body.

630
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:20,692

to buy me a couple of days,
and now you're taking 'em back?

631
00:35:25,308 --> 00:35:26,872
Will it hurt?

632
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,567
As your body goes into
acute organ rejection,

633
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:34,012
your liver will begin to swell,
it'll put pressure on--

Yeah. It'll hurt.
We can knock you out.

Mm, no. If Max wakes up,
I want to talk to her.

636
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:56,766

but she's not getting better.
She also says...

They come in a little wheel,
they don't look anything
like decongestants.

00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:43,991
There was no ulcerations on the skin.

671
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,045
With the bleeding,
it looks more like leptospirosis.

672
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:49,285
Without conjunctivitis
and elevated creatinine?

673
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,945
What about typhoid or
some kind of relapsing fever?

674
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:53,747
Makes sense,
if we were in the Sudan.

675
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:55,354
We sure she hasn't been
out of the country?

676
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:58,343
She hasn't even been out of
the state in at least a year.
Neither has Max.

677
00:37:58,427 --> 00:37:59,686
Maybe she lied.

678
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,158
You talk to
her friends, neighbors?

679
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:03,543
You don't know?

680
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:07,067
Come on,
if you don't stay up to date on my notes,
where's your next article gonna come from?

681
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,134
You talk to the dog?

682
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:11,877
We're not as upon
foreign languages as you are.

683
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:14,806
Ha! Has the dog been traveling?

684
00:38:15,216 --> 00:38:17,394
- It came from a breeder.
- Where?

685
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,314
I don't know.

686
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:22,295
A place called
Blue Barrel Kennels.

687
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:24,343
They only had the thing
for like two days.

688
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,619
Blue Barrel is a kind of cactus.

689
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,754
You see many cacti in Jersey?

690
00:38:38,503 --> 00:38:40,106
Want to seea magic trick?

691
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:48,316
Oh, no! Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?

692
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:50,857
Is it here?

693
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:54,881
No. What about here?

694
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,662
There it is.

695
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:02,745
Aw, that doesn't look
anything like a nose.

696
00:39:03,148 --> 00:39:05,185
Cameron:
That wasn't there this morning.

697
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:22,466
Get that to the lab and call CDC.

698
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:24,111
And tell them what?

699
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,095
That we have a patient
with the plague.

700
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:30,982
The black plague?

701
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:32,542
Looks that way.

702
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,480
Plague is carried
by rodents, not dogs.

703
00:39:34,564 --> 00:39:36,892
Where there's dogs,
there's fleas.

704
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:38,778
And if they hail
from the Southwest,

705
00:39:38,895 --> 00:39:42,760
and those fleas can't tell the difference
between prairie dogs and puppy dogs.

706
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:47,022
A small percentage of plague cases
present with sleep disturbance.

707
00:39:48,573 --> 00:39:52,524
Imagine an idyllic river of bacteria.

708
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,846
Okay, it's not idyllic for her,
but it serves my purposes.

709
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:00,022
The steroids and immunosuppressants acted
like a big, honkin' dam across the river--

710
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:03,673
Physics 101.
Put a dam up in front
of a raging river, the river rises.

711
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:05,716
By stopping
the immunosuppressants,

712
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,956
we blew up the dam and
a 100-foot wall of bacteria
flooded her lymph nodes.

713
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,965
We better find out
where that dog is now.

714
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:14,565
After we start
the immunosuppressants

715
00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:18,876
and fill her up to the eyeballs with
streptomycin sulfate
gentamicin and tetracycline.

716
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:20,656
Use a garden hose
if you've got one.

717
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,372
Get yourselves some
prophylactic treatments as well.

718
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:27,407
I've got the plague?

719
00:40:28,334 --> 00:40:30,124
Don't worry, it's treatable.

720
00:40:30,955 --> 00:40:35,637
Being a bitch, though,
nothing we can do about that.

721
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:44,409
You weren't in your room.

722
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,754
The surgeon said
I'd heal faster if I walk.

723
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:50,697
Got this far, needed a rest.

724
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,975
What you did was crazy,
but it was pretty amazing too.

725
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:57,059
Yeah, I'm a hero.

726
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:02,752
She's been planning to leave me.

727
00:41:05,147 --> 00:41:06,592
Really?

728
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:10,965
She told a friend;
the friend let it slip.

729
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:16,667
You knew and you gave up
half your liver anyway?

730
00:41:19,383 --> 00:41:21,451
She can't leave me now.

731
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:30,137
You really want her to stay out of guilt?
That's not gonna make either of you happy.

732
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,762
You don't know that.

733
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:34,197
I love her.

734
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:38,615
I just want her to stay.

735
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,218
I don't own House's cases.

736
00:41:59,128 --> 00:42:01,869
You had just as much right
as I did to write it up.

737
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:06,160
You shoulda told me, but
I shoulda handled it better too.

738
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:12,135
If we want this not to get
in the way of our friendship,

739
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:15,128
I think we both
have to apologize, and

740
00:42:15,735 --> 00:42:17,530
put it behind us.

741
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:22,171
I like you, really.

742
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:24,549
We have a good time
working together.

743
00:42:24,986 --> 00:42:26,753
But ten years from now,

744
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:30,313
we're not gonna be
hanging out, having dinners.

745
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:32,117
Maybe we'll exchange Christmas cards,

746
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,415
say hi, give a hug
if we're at the same conference.

747
00:42:35,894 --> 00:42:39,661
[Exhale]
We're not friends.

748
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:41,780
We're colleagues.

749
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:47,742
And I don't have
anything to apologize for.

750
