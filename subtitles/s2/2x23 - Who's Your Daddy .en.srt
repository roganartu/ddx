1
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,990
I know that one.

2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,600
I was at the studio when grandfather recorded it.

3
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,030
Been thinking about your mom?

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,560
Mama, everything, my whole life.

5
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,150
It was all a lie.

6
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,280
I never knew you.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,380
I never knew you were my dad.

8
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,730
Your life's going to be okay, leona.

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,270
You're a good kid. You got it together.

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,100
Survived the last eight months. On your own.

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,700
You're not your grandfather.

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,000
Or your mom.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,530
You're not going to make
the same mistakes they did.

14
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,230
I'm proud that i'm your father.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,030
I'm glad I'm getting this chance.

16
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,590
ready for a cookie, darling?

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,490
We gotta go! Get out of here!

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,160
Leona!

19
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,810
Leona!

20
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,430
You've reached a number that has been
disconnected and is no longer in service.

21
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,810
If you feel you've reached this
recording in error, go with it, hang up.

22
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,950
On three. One, two--

23
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,000
House, pick up. I know it's your day off.

24
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,900
And you've no doubt got lots of exciting plans,

25
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,280
but I've got a case.

26
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,380
16-year-old girl presenting
with cardiogenic shock.

27
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,320
But no heart attack.

28
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,550
her heart looks fine. E. R.
Did a full cardiac work-up.

29
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,860
Tox screen's clean, blood shows no infection.

30
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,760
All on the top page. I'm a real good reader.

31
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,070
Personal chart hand-off means
there's something else.

32
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,070
I'm hoping it's not personal.

33
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,300
The guy who brought the girl
in says he knows you.

34
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,110
I thought I'd met all your friend.

35
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,690
I was also wondering if you could
take a look at these.

36
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,200
um, when you have a chance. No hurry.

37
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,720
It's just a couple of medical histories,
one with a minor cancer concern.

38
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,120
No problem.

39
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,100
G- man!

40
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,030
You thought I was gonna do it, didn't you?

41
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,650
Do I know you?

42
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,930
Come on, it's me. Crandall.

43
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,140
Doesn't ring a bell.

44
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,670
Man, I can't believe you've forgotten--

45
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,370
unless you mean dylan crandall,
the man who'll believe anything.

46
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,540
See, I just made you believe that I--

47
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,510
you haven't changed.

48
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,690
Heard about your leg.

49
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,040
Yeah, pulled a hamstring playing twister.
Just gonna walk it off.

50
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,440
So who's the girl?

51
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Jesse baker's granddaughter.

52
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,290
You always said you'd give your
right hand to play like him.

53
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,560
No, I said I'd give my right
hand to have his left.

54
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,130
Why is she with you?

55
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,910
She lost her mom in katrina.
Her home, everything.

56
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,060
And I'm her father.

57
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,090
Hmm. Yeah, she looks just like you.
Got the same 'fro.

58
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,990
I wrote a book about baker.
Hung out with him. And his daughter.

59
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,270
That is how babies are made.

60
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,620
I never knew. She never knew.

61
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,490
Her mom lied for 16 years.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,590
That's unbelievable.

63
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,860
Yeah.

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,150
No, seriously. I don't believe it.

65
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,650
Her mom was pissed at me about my book.
I trashed her and her dad.

66
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,270
She wouldn't talk to me.
Obviously she's not gonna tell leona that--

67
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,510
you're a sucker. You always were.

68
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,000
Does that mean you're not going to help her?

69
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,080
Why wouldn't I?

70
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,830
She's not scamming me.

71
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,040
acute myocardial infarction?

72
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,360
E. R. Said no. Retest.

73
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,770
Wolff-parkinson-white syndrome?

74
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,530
E. R. Said no. Retest. And read the damn file.

75
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,710
You just gave them to us.

76
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,110
Delta wave on the ekg-- it's all a no.

77
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,940
Everything about her heart is healthy.

78
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,020
She's a katrina victim.

79
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,830
She's better than crandall.
He's a katrina victim victim.

80
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,970
I don't think she was expecting yo sympathy.

81
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,010
I think her point was,
new orleans was a third-world country.

82
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,070
Toxins, molds, sewage in the streets.

83
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,350
What if her heart is like my bike?

84
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,420
Runs like crap when I'm by myself,
but if I take it to the mechanic, it runs great.

85
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,950
an arrhythmia. One-time event?

86
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,450
What are we going to do,
keep her in a room on a cardiac monitor until

87
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,610
she has another arrhythmia?
That could be weeks, months.

88
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,510
Relax. I happen to know
she's going to have one right after lunch.

89
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,950
We are golden.

90
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,560
You can't induce an arrhythmia on someone
whose heart nearly gave out 48 hours ago.

91
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Sure you can.

92
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,160
It's kind of technical, you stick all
these cool little wires inside r somehow.

93
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,790
I mean you shouldn'T.

94
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,500
Oh, right, because it would be much more ethical
to let it happen in an uncontrolled setting.

95
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,020
There's always a team of cardiologists
having lunch at the next table. This is jersey.

96
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,560
She's a minor. She's going to need consent.

97
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,690
I'll go talk to him.

98
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,400
Oh, that's an excellent plan.

99
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,560
Give him the form and tell him
it's wrong and dangerous.

100
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,720
I can handle a simple consent form.

101
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,750
Okay.

102
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,570
I'll be crandall.

103
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,270
Dr. Cameron!

104
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,520
House, from what you say,
this guy will trust-- are you in this scene?

105
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,090
Go.

106
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,120
I need to talk to you about a
procedure we'd like to do on leona.

107
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,570
Like to do?

108
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,250
Is this fun for you?

109
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,090
He's not you. He's not going to mock me--

110
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,650
stay in character.

111
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,210
I'm so scared. Hold me.

112
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,420
In order to figure out which
circuit is misfiring,

113
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,660
we need to map all the electrical
activity in her heart.

114
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,390
Swear to me on the bible
you'd do this if it was your kid.

115
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,350
Good-bye.

116
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,900
To map the electrical
pathways in her heart,

117
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,380
we send electricity through each,
one at a time, until one fails.

118
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,720
That sounds dangerous.

119
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,860
It's a risk i am prepared to take.

120
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,040
If she's got an electrical problem, couldn't
more electricity blow her whole system?

121
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,310
Well, look who's been watching
bill nye the science guy.

122
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,000
Test is perfectly safe. We do it every day.

123
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,950
And you believe me.

124
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,260
I shouldn't do the test?

125
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,590
It's crazy dangerous.

126
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,360
Just sign the damn form.

127
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,870
I'm not crying. I can handle this.

128
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,740
Then blow your nose.

129
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,730
I need dna from somewhere.

130
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,240
You're not running a paternity test.

131
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,110
She's gonna stay around just
long enough to get your bank account,

132
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,990
your credit card numbers, then she's
going to be off with her next daddy.

133
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,860
With what she's been through,
why would you assume--

134
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,280
because of what she's been through.

135
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,940
Because that's your default position.
Always has been.

136
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,960
Because she's still alive.

137
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,380
Raised by a junkie, living on the streets,
that tends to kick the sweetness out of you.

138
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,630
I figured you'd have mellowed.

139
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,770
Because you're an idiot.

140
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,350
If I let you do the test,
it means I don't trust her.

141
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,720
No, it means I don't trust her.

142
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,200
100,99,98...she's out.

143
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,080
heart rhythm's normal.
Insert the first catheter.

144
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,710
I'm in.

145
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,230
all heart rhythms still normal.

146
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,560
haven't zapped her yet.

147
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,860
send the first electrical pulse.

148
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,580
Sinoatrial node is normal.

149
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,870
Next.

150
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,850
I've got supraventricular tachycardia.
-- Stop the current.

151
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,820
Is she hallucinating?

152
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,990
I. V. Push stat,12.5 adenosine.

153
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,510
She's crashing. B. P.'S plummeting.

154
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,260
Foreman, is she hallucinating?

155
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,660
No, normal waves.

156
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,350
The av node is not the bad pathway.

157
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,140
All that was was a heart attack.

158
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,190
Reset her so we can find the real problem.

159
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,320
Charging.-- Clear.

160
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,400
normal rhythm.

161
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,890
Chase. High right atrium, please.

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,380
Her heart's fragile after that
last attack. Chances of tachycardia--

163
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,500
you have my permission to blame
foreman at any negligence trial.

164
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,980
send the electrical pulse.

165
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,920
That's the one. She's hallucinating.

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,060
It's near the coronary sinus.

167
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,690
Freeze it.

168
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,770
damaged heart muscle gone.
Cryoblation complete.

169
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,580
the eeg's back to normal.
No hallucinations.

170
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,420
She'll be fine by breakfast.

171
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,710
Interesting reading.

172
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,380
Those are my top two choices for sperm donors.

173
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,190
I wanted your medical opinion on genetics.

174
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,170
They're losers.

175
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,910
Uh, medically, or--

176
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,760
donor 1284 likes square dancing.

177
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,940
No one likes square dancing.

178
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,720
613's been practicing medicine for
five minutes. Calls himself a "healer."

179
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,020
Loves mozart.

180
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,750
I'm not going dancing with them,
I'm looking for healthy sperm.

181
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,870
He got four living grandparents.

182
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,340
Who they are, what they do-- that
doesn't matter?

183
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm leaning towards 613.

184
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,300
Oh, sure, go with the jewish number.

185
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,560
1284 has a cousin that tested
positive for the brca1 gene.

186
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,770
But his mother was negative,
which means so's your baby.

187
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,850
What about the-- mediterranean-dutch
factor on the dad's side? It's not a problem,

188
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,660
because his dad's mom didn't
carry the thalassemia gene.

189
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,420
The bigger issue is the jerk and poser genes.

190
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,770
This mozart lie-- people can't
like classical music?

191
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,080
You're designing a kid-- a loser kid.

192
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,370
He's already getting pummeled at recess.

193
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,710
Here. Knock yourself out.

194
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,360
Go find sperm that can beat up 613's kids.

195
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,790
And thanks for your help.

196
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,200
Pretentiousness is hereditary.

197
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,170
Just 'cause they haven't found the gene yet...

198
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,390
could I have some water, please?

199
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,940
Hello? I just need some water.

200
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,590
Is anyone there?

201
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,280
Mama?

202
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,860
No!

203
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,540
a second hallucination means we didn't
fix her heart. Maybe we missed something.

204
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,000
Her heart's fine. If she hallucinated,
it wasn't caused by her heart.

205
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,000
if? The screaming, the floundering?
It was a hallucination.

206
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,190
What if it wasn't a hallucination?

207
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,750
We covered-- not finished.

208
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,270
What if it was an atypical seizure?

209
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,320
seizure? She saw her mother. Mother's dead.
Ergo, hallucination.

210
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,320
Anyone want to explain that?

211
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,580
His leg hurts. Walking takes
his mind off of it.

212
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,710
A flashback.

213
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,090
All that wind and rain from the hurricane.
Post-traumatic stress syndrome.

214
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,560
Why are you so bent on her not
having a hallucination?

215
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,000
If she did have a hallucination,

216
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,910
then the heart problem that we predicted, found,
and fixed was just a gigantic coincidence.

217
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,250
His leg always hurts.-- It's getting worse.

218
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,870
What if the heart isn't a coincidence,

219
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,490
and isn't what caused the hallucination?

220
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,960
Arrhythmia hurts.

221
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,120
What if her hallucination was caused by pain?

222
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,780
What if she has a disease

223
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,260
that translates pain into a bizarre
physiological response, like a hallucination?

224
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,130
She has an autoimmune disease.
She needs a crp, a rheumatoid factor--

225
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
I can prove an autoimmune disease
in five minutes. She needs a pet scan.

226
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,610
You can't test for autoimmune in--

227
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,650
I'm proving that her hallucinations
are a consistent response to pain,

228
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,930
which proves that she has an autoimmune disease.

229
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,570
How do you test someone's response to pain?

230
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,230
Easy. Hurt them.

231
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,240
It's not going to hurt at all.

232
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,590
But we just need to make sure you don't move.

233
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,820
I won'T.

234
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,710
Okay, give me your arm.

235
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,920
I need to check your muscle responses.

236
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,440
Okay, turn it over. Palm upward.

237
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,840
Everything okay?

238
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,360
Yeah.

239
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,830
Ow!-- What the hell was that?

240
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,230
diagnostic test.

241
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,360
Cerebral cortex responded normally.
She's not hallucinating.

242
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,180
You know he's not your father, don't you?

243
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,310
He's my dad. Mama told me.

244
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

245
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,360
House, leave her alone.

246
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,810
Come on, we both know it's a hustle.

247
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,730
Are the walls closing in?

248
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,810
No. Why are you doing this?

249
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,260
Spiders coming out of my nose?

250
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,100
Let me out.

251
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,980
House, the test is over.
Dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex--

252
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,350
give me your hand.-- No!

253
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,000
Give me your hand.

254
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,930
Forget him.

255
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,660
He's not the perfect mark because
he was the perfect mark.

256
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,800
Plenty of people got there before you.

257
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,660
He's used up. Tainted. Pumped dry.

258
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,630
she's hallucinating.

259
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,290
she's lost everything. And you're
breaking fingers. A new low.

260
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,670
Diagnoically, she needed to be hurt.
I wanted to hurt her. Win-win.

261
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,500
What I didn't consider was a
threshold to trigger the hallucinations.

262
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,710
Otherwise, I'd have done the finger-bending first
instead of stabbing her twice. That was cruel.

263
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,600
If her autoimmune disease is this advanced,
usual treatment's not going to help.

264
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,690
We don't even know which
autoimmune disease she has.

265
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,830
Could be lambert-eaton, could be graves--

266
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,150
good point. Let's kill them all at once.

267
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,810
the only way to do that is to
replace her entire immune system.

268
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,970
Good point. Let's do that.

269
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,400
Bone marrow transplant requires an exact match.

270
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,930
Leona has no siblings.

271
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,320
Good point.

272
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,650
She's all alone, poor thing.
No one in the whole, wide world.

273
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,550
I asked for this tuned.
Did you get this instrument tuned?

274
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,650
If my daughter needs bone marrow, why are
you looking in a bone marrow registry?

275
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,960
Because that's where they keep the bone marrow.

276
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,380
I'm her father.

277
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,470
How does somebody who believes absolutely
anything become a nonfiction writer?

278
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,470
Test my bone marrow.

279
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,790
Here's how this is going to end.

280
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,870
One day, you'll be sitting at your computer,
writing one of your little music books,

281
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,930
and your daughter will come home with a big,
angry policemanwho'll throw you in jail

282
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,100
because,"daddy touched my poozle."

283
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,970
Test me.

284
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,680
Happy to.

285
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,920
Just my marrow.
I'm not authorizing a paternity test.

286
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,750
You're that afraid of the truth?

287
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,860
I know the truth.

288
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,980
Easy lay fay's truth was that she needed
a bus ticket home to see her sick grandma.

289
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,280
You gave her 100 bucks.

290
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,140
She bought weed.

291
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,960
I know, because I told her you'd
go for the sick grandma story.

292
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,240
If our friendship means anything to you--

293
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,370
oh, come on. Do you know me at all?

294
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,150
If you do the test, one of two things happens.
Either you're right or I'm right.

295
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,860
If you're right, I'll be miserable.

296
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:01,530
And if I'm right, I'll hate myself
'cause I didn't trust her. Either way, I lose.

297
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,010
They don't itch. Not raised.

298
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,340
He's had his mmr.

299
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,220
No one's sick at school.
His father took him camping.

300
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,090
We caught two spiders.

301
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,860
You didn't tell me about the spiders.

302
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,890
Did you get a new couch?

303
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,640
Do you think there might
be some sort of toxin?-- What color is it?

304
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,160
Red.

305
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,610
Is that where you watch your
cartoons after you take your bath?

306
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,340
Fall asleep sometimes?

307
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,710
Yes.-- Bless you.

308
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,220
Need you. Now.

309
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,050
Yes, mistress.

310
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,610
I'll write you a prescription for
one of these. Just wet and apply.

311
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,030
You didn't tell anyone else what I'm doing?

312
00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:59,820
Not a soul.

313
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,660
Wilson?

314
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,285
Cameron, maybe you mentioned it to her.

315
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,920
No, I'm a really good secret-keeper.

316
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,030
I never told anybody that wilson wets his bed.

317
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:15,305
Oh, you tricked me.

318
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:21,110
Part of the protocol for in vitro fertilization
is twice-daily injections of menotropins.

319
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,540
I can't do it myself.

320
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,030
Turn around.

321
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,770
No clever comments about bending over?

322
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:34,780
Not unless you want me to.

323
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,480
I'm just not used to house the professional.

324
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,905
I was just thinking about what
your mother looked like.

325
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,420
Since your father obviously chose
her for breeding purposes--

326
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:52,105
shut up.

327
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,760
Natural selection sucks.

328
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,465
We pick our mates based on breast size,
cars they drive.

329
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,170
They did autopsies on married couples.
Found a correlation in pancreas size.

330
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,980
We're hard-wired to pick for stupid reasons.
You have the chance to pick for smart reasons.

331
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:11,627
I think the germans had a similar
theory about 60 years ago.

332
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:15,205
I'm not advocating wiping out entire races.
I'm just saying,

333
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,350
you don't want to mate with
the first plastic cup that buys you a drink.

334
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,880
I'm pretty sure you got that.

335
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,690
Microbes can be sneaky.

336
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,850
Thanks.

337
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,400
Twice a day. This is going to be fun.

338
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,190
I got it.

339
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,890
So why were you friends with this guy?

340
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,920
We were 20 years old. He had a car.

341
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,560
If he'd been a woman, I would have married him.

342
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
- Is he a match?
- No.

343
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,540
Lying girl lucked out. We found
one in the registry.

344
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,860
Is he the dad?

345
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,000
- I don't think so.
- You didn't run the test?

346
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,700
Said I wouldn'T.

347
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,300
Okay. So either you lied, or he has...

348
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:43,360
pictures of you being nice.

349
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,970
Stop the radiation.

350
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,070
What the hell is that?

351
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,480
I have no idea.

352
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,340
Lab results on the black ooze.
You're not gonna believe it.

353
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,535
She pooped out of her mouth.

354
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,620
The sample contains stool
and digested blood. How did you guess?

355
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:15,495
Because it oozed.

356
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,155
If it was in her stomach, it would have sprayed.

357
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:22,160
If it was in her lungs, she would have coughed.
This oozed, as in squeezed, as in reverse peristalsis.

358
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:24,025
Who's hungry? Mexican takeout?

359
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,360
In order for digested blood to be in her
intestines, she had to have internal bleeding.

360
00:23:27,395 --> 00:23:30,625
Order for whatever was in her intestines
to come back up, there had to be a blockage.

361
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,100
liver failure. There'd be no proteins to clot the blood,
so it'd leak into her stomach, mess up her intestines.

362
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:39,440
Which means, oops, we were wrong. Because no
autoimmune disease shuts down an organ in two hours.

363
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:43,030
We need to do a liver biopsy,
find out what the real problem is.

364
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,380
Hey. Need to talk to you.

365
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,365
The good news is, she doesn't
have an autoimmune condition,

366
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,090
so she doesn't need a bone marrow transplant,
and we were able to stop the irradiation in time.

367
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,685
Bad news, she has potty mouth.

368
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,550
Her liver is failing, which has made
her digestive system go in reverse.

369
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,540
It's actually much worse than it sounds.

370
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,560
We need to do a liver biopsy.

371
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,330
I don't know what's going to happen
when we stick a needle into her liver.

372
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:40,340
She could die right then and there.

373
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,270
You need to tell me what to do.

374
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,000
No inside information on thione.

375
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,910
Crandall, three days ago,
you didn't even know this girl.

376
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,600
If she'd been hit by a bus,
you wouldn't lose a moment's sleep.

377
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,730
There are people all over this hospital in just
as much trouble, and just as not related to you.

378
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:07,420
You telling me i shouldn't care?

379
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,130
Prepping me to handle it for when she dies?

380
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,270
It's brown, it's lumpy.

381
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,470
I'm going to heave all over my desk.

382
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:44,285
Chicken mol?

383
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,040
21 herbs and spices.

384
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,785
I find it very comforting,

385
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,095
you defending a man you haven't seen in years.

386
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,120
To know my friend, no matter what,
will always be my champion. My protector.

387
00:25:58,155 --> 00:26:00,550
I'm not protecting him, I'm smacking her.

388
00:26:00,585 --> 00:26:01,945
The modesty of a true hero.

389
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,140
Push me and I'll let her die,
just so you'll stop annoying me.

390
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,785
Here's my theory. You're jealous.

391
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,630
He's maturing, he's accepting responsibility,
you're emotionally stuck at 17.

392
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:17,170
He's manufacturing responsibility,
he's not maturing.

393
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:19,750
He hasn't changed at all.

394
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,465
So then, why do you care?

395
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,805
That black ooze we saw?

396
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,110
That was a bowel movement.

397
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,145
Out of her mouth.

398
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,175
You're trying to end
this conversation by grossing me out?

399
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,980
I'm an oncologist.
Half my patients have their skin sloughing off.

400
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,780
Why are you so worried about this guy?

401
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,500
He was having a rough time with his girlfriend.

402
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,290
He was in love. He was always in love.

403
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,590
Wanted to marry her. I thought she was flaky.

404
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:56,215
She was sending mixed signals.

405
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,450
So you gave him advice and she dumped him.

406
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,390
No, I told him that i would talk to her.

407
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,935
And you blew it?

408
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,100
Technically...

409
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,550
I was doing him a favor. She was nuts.

410
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,060
Stop the biopsy.

411
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,900
I'm right at her liver.

412
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:22,910
It's house. He says stop.

413
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,860
Check it out.

414
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,610
Please tell me you didn't stop
the biopsy to play us some tunes.

415
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:39,070
The left hand. It's very subtle.
Very delicate.

416
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:40,795
This girl is dying.

417
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,690
Be dying a lot faster if I let you do
that obviously unnecessary biopsy. Now listen.

418
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:49,335
I asked for this tuned.
Did you get this tuned?

419
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,420
My god, grandpa was an angry drunk.
If only we'd known.

420
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,320
Here's how to become a great artist.

421
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:56,685
First, get miserable.

422
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,825
Misery drives you to become a great artist,

423
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,520
but the art does nothing for your misery,
which drives you to drugs,

424
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:04,760
which makes you a lousy artist.
And this is not lousy.

425
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,540
You saying he didn't do drugs?

426
00:29:07,575 --> 00:29:09,835
Not when he played this.

427
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,850
Something was screwing with his personality.

428
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:15,465
Yeah, drugs and alcohol don't do that?

429
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,455
And that note that he says is out of tune,
it's not.

430
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,265
Which means that something is screwing
with his aural perception too.

431
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,930
Now, what happens when you add all of that to
the liver disease which he supposedly died of?

432
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:28,930
Too much iron. He could have had hemochromatosis.
That's genetic.

433
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:31,560
Unless you can tell me miles
davis couldn't play stoned--

434
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,295
he played better when he wasn'T.

435
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,750
I think-- I mean, no one knows for sure.

436
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:38,170
I'll get leona a tibc and serum ferritin.

437
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:40,620
We can test this in three minutes.

438
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,955
So, what is she, foreman?

439
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,160
Light-skinned black chick or
dark-skinned white chick?

440
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,515
Not sure.
Can we hear the music again?

441
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,585
it's too early to see jaundice from her liver.

442
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,840
True-- this is a photograph of
leona when she was 13 years old.

443
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,235
She's darker now.

444
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,680
she's been living on
the streets for eight months.

445
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,430
No tan line, so unless those streets
she's been living on are indoor streets,

446
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:18,065
I'm thinking she's got iron
deposits and melanin.

447
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,200
Both by-products of hemochromatosis,
just like granddad used to make.

448
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,685
Squid exam to calculate the
amount of iron in her blood.

449
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,180
Then treat her with deferoxamine.
She'll be fine by lunch.

450
00:30:30,215 --> 00:30:34,620
See, I was wrong before,
about the breakfast.

451
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,840
there's the iron. Lots of it.

452
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,365
I'm not going to get this job, am I?

453
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,740
It's a done deal.
I knew it the moment I saw you.

454
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:11,090
Interview's just a formality.

455
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,735
house. What are you--

456
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,055
lisa cuddy, this is patrick linehan.

457
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,945
Patrick's going to be the new intern
rotating in my department.

458
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,800
I didn't even know you were looking for one.
Nice to meet you.

459
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,580
Sorry, I laugh when I'm nervous.

460
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,400
Bet you've been doing that your whole life,
huh?

461
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,500
What kind of medicine are you interested in,
patrick?

462
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:36,595
Cancer, infectious disease. The big devils.

463
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,745
I think that medicine has become
too institutionalized.

464
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,440
We need to send a message to our
patients that we're just like them.

465
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:47,410
I mean, we're all people.

466
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,400
"We're all people."I like that.

467
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,905
She's all hard science, facts.

468
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,980
I like to know a person's hopes and dreams.

469
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,020
What kind of music do you like, patrick?

470
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:03,807
- Actually, I--
- I'm a mozart man.

471
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:06,560
He says what I feel, but can't express.

472
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,815
I'm late for a meeting.

473
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,370
see, this is why the face-to-face
interview is so important.

474
00:32:14,405 --> 00:32:16,970
You gotta know who you're
getting in bed with.

475
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,120
Get him out of here.

476
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,100
Deferoxamine is a chelating agent.

477
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,345
It binds to the iron so that
her liver can get rid of it.

478
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,190
Once the iron's out of the liver, it's finally
evacuated by the body in the form of urine.

479
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,310
Should be quick and painless.

480
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,930
- Leona? Crash cart.
- What's happening?

481
00:33:10,965 --> 00:33:13,230
She's not getting any air.

482
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,855
ct showed her lungs are swiss cheese.

483
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,890
Ventilator's helping, but at this rate,
her time's basically up.

484
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,915
We developed a theory. Hemochromatosis.

485
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,410
Like good scientists, we tested that theory.
We proved that theory.

486
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:49,472
We acted based on that proof, and we treated her.

487
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:52,465
As a result of which, she is on the verge of death.

488
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,735
Is it just me, or have we discovered
a flaw in the scientific method?

489
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,310
Walk me through it, step by step. What is
supposed to happen when you give someone deferoxamine?

490
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:01,925
It's a chelating agent.

491
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,895
And what does the chelating do?

492
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,675
- Removes excess iron from the liver.--
- How?

493
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,420
The iron is heavy. It gets stuck.
Deferoxamine is like a lubricant.

494
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:11,070
It makes the iron slick so it
can move around again.

495
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:12,395
Moves around where?

496
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,530
It's supposed to be discharged through waste.

497
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:18,617
Her waste system is a little screwy right now.

498
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:21,670
Means the iron can't go where it wants to go.

499
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,745
What if it moved to her lungs?

500
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,580
and whatever's in her lungs likes iron,
bound with it, started poking holes.

501
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,205
What likes iron?

502
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,260
Oxygen attaches itself to iron,
which increases her chance of infection.

503
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:35,130
No, we started massive
antibiotics prior to the radiation.

504
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:37,187
Some neurodegenerative diseases like iron.

505
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:39,210
Mri was clean. No iron deposits on the brain.

506
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,570
Fungus likes iron.

507
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,955
No objections to that one?

508
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,945
if a fungus is doing all this, she's dead.

509
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,605
There are 25 antifungals.
If we don't know which fungus--

510
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,230
- when in doubt, go broad.
- The most common is aspergillus.

511
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:54,105
Continue to ventilate her lungs.

512
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:58,430
Get her on a voriconazole drip
and hope she has aspergillus.

513
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,050
The process is confidential.
You violated his privacy. How did you even--

514
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:12,930
I looked up "loser" in the cryobank.

515
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,680
You wouldn't go within 100 miles of that idiot,
and yet you're willing to have his baby.

516
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,750
I'm not looking for a date.
I'm tired of looking--

517
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,460
Cotton ball?

518
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,285
I don't care if you marry this guy,

519
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,450
date this guy, go through his garbage,
but you should know.

520
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:35,730
Genes matter. Who you are matters.

521
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:38,230
Find someone you trust.

522
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,450
Someone like you?

523
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,410
Someone you like.

524
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,590
Listen. Uh, sorry. Okay.

525
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,930
- It's not what you think.--
- I rub his leg.

526
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:00,220
Oh, ingrid. Hi.

527
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,155
Okay,

528
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:07,040
you feel guilty about stealing the guy's girl.
I get that, and I'm glad. It's a good thing.

529
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:09,515
But you did the paternity test.

530
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,840
And either the paternity test comes back
negative, and you shove it in the guy's face,

531
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:18,870
or it comes back positive, and you shut up,
and your leg starts hurting.

532
00:36:18,905 --> 00:36:21,400
Or I never ran the test.

533
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,350
- Not what you think.
- leona's lungs collapsed.

534
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,840
The treatment's not working.
We've got the wrong fungus.

535
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,520
You can stop. She ruined it.

536
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,805
Three rules for hunting fungus.
Location, location, location.

537
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,235
Crandall says she was living at
the children's shelter in ridgeland.

538
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,870
Okay, the one thing we know for sure is she was
not living at the children's shelter in ridgeland.

539
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:46,580
Why would he lie about that?

540
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:47,685
he wouldn'T.

541
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,670
But he'd believe her story about the sweet
little girl trying to do the right thing.

542
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:53,440
We can't ask leona where she was,
she's intubated.

543
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,055
Don't try to talk.

544
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,890
You've got a big medical thing in your mouth.

545
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:18,680
Just blink if you understand me.

546
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,045
Fantastic.

547
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,130
Blink if you lied to crandall about everything.

548
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,740
You picked up a fungus somewhere.

549
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,670
If you were living at the shelter,
like you told your new daddy,

550
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:41,870
then I got nothing to go on. And you will die.

551
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,340
So, did you lie to crandall?

552
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,360
You're a lousy con artist.

553
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,825
First rule of the game is know your mark.

554
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,435
Once you got crandall to bite
on the papa thing, you had him.

555
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,750
You could have told him that you were
servicing al-qaeda suicide bombers for crack,

556
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:08,460
and this guy would still have let
you pick out the colors in your new room.

557
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,640
Did you lie to crandall?

558
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,460
Where were you?

559
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,120
And the winner is...

560
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,310
oh, you read it.
I just get so nervous at these things.

561
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,440
- Recording studio.
- She read the book.

562
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,100
She knew how much crandall
hated that place, what went on there.

563
00:38:53,135 --> 00:38:54,805
She overplayed her hand.

564
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,730
she was desperate. If she didn't sell this,
she was stuck in hell.

565
00:38:57,765 --> 00:38:59,720
Recording studio doesn't help us medically.

566
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,435
recording studios.

567
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,500
Why are these buildings different
from all other buildings?

568
00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:07,637
Sound proofing.
Absorbs sound, also absorbs moisture.

569
00:39:07,672 --> 00:39:10,996
Where there's moisture,
a lot of it-- say, katrina moist--

570
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:14,285
zygomycosis. Only occurs at
the highest levels of mold.

571
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,450
Start her on an iv drip of
amphotericin b with colony-stimulating factors.

572
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:20,420
She'll be fine by...

573
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,330
dinner.

574
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,785
She's going to be fine.

575
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,490
She said she'd never go back there.

576
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,935
She lied to you.

577
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,340
She's your kid. Get used to it.

578
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,480
Thank you for the injections.

579
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,670
You're welcome.

580
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,150
You came all the way up here
just to tell me that?

581
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,100
No.

582
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,200
pretty much normal.
Liver function tests are good.

583
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,350
Thanks, g-man.

584
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,420
What makes you think you'd be a good father?

585
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,630
I don't know.

586
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,770
Feels right. Feels good.

587
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,410
Well, at least you've got a good reason.

588
00:41:06,445 --> 00:41:09,160
Feels good is a good enough reason.

589
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,205
What's happening?

590
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,330
She's choking. She can't breathe.
Get him out of here, will you?

591
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,500
Out.

592
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,290
Quick, the curtain.

593
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,390
You're breathing on your own.
Choking's normal.

594
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,565
I lied to him.

595
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,490
I ran a paternity test.

596
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,520
Your lie...

597
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,540
was a bad one.

598
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,680
He is your dad.

599
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,390
We're even.

600
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,200
Uh, your machine's broken.
There's not even a message.

601
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,460
House? Are you there?

602
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,360
Okay, see you monday, I guess.
