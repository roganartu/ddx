That one of
the more serious ones?
Yeah.

142
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,396
It's also possible
that this is just a symptom
of the fertility treatments.

143
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,164
And now that we know you're
not pregnant, we're gonna
start you on tamoxifen

to counteract the estrogen.

145
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,231
Will that undo
all the fertility treatments?

146
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,175
For the time being, yeah.
But it could cure you.

147

once we get you healthy.

Symptomatic
of Iunch with Cuddy?

now defines Huntington's.

156
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,142
Then what do you need me for?
Start her
on Huntington's meds.

157
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,943
Before we get
her test results back?

158
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,450
We start her on valproic acid,
it could destroy her Iiver.

159
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,780
Could stroke.
If we wait,

160
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,014
she could progress
to full-blown psychosis,

will never get the chance
to say goodbye.

how that feels?

What's happening?
She's having
a psychotic break.

169
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,443
No! She is not yours!
What do you want with her?

170
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,573
Calm down!
TED: Honey.

171
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,741
Margo,
you're gonna hurt someone.

172
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:45,977
No.

173
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,480
CHASE: Push two milligrams
of Ativan.

174
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,079
I want my daughter!

175
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,717
She's not yours!
I want my daughter!
No more experiments!

176
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,386
No!

177
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,198
CAMERON: How can
her Huntington's test
be negative?

178
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,299
FOREMAN: AII the signs
are there. Movement disorder,
psychosis.

179
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,741
It should be Huntington's.

180
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,803
Yeah.
It would certainly
make your job easier.

181
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,308
Well, good news for Margo,
it's not Huntington's.
Bad news for us,

182
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,784
her psychotic break
eliminates fertility meds.

183
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,289
Which means we have no idea
what's wrong with her.

184
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,690
We give you so much,
and you give us so Iittle.

185
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,161
You know, the patient
is prime age to develop
spontaneous schizophrenia.

186
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,256
AImost impossible.
No family history
of mental illness.

187
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,960
How about toxins?

188
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,969
None of her family members
are sick. Nobody at her
office, her volunteer group,

189
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,405
kid's classes,
and PTA members, all fine.

190
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:47,845
So she raises a daughter,
runs a business,
she does charity work,

191
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,812
she volunteers at school,
attends PTA.

192
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,851
What makes Mommy run?

193
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,046
You're thinking drugs?
Cocaine.

194
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,018
Explains the psychosis
and the flailing.

195
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,155
And the uncanny ability
to bring home the bacon,
fry it up in a pan,

196
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,823
and never ever Iet Teddy
forget that he's a man.

197
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,160
I'II go Iook for her stash.

198
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,495
Take Foreman.

199
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,797
There's gotta be a reason
for the stereotype.

200
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,815
I know you're in there.

201
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,784
I can hear you caring.

202
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,627
The door was Iocked.

203
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,192
It means
I didn't wanna see anyone.

204
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,571
High school reunion?

205
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,401
It's for a patient.
She can't roll.

206
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,609
Hey, I Iocked that door, too.

207
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,478
Paranoia.
Must be the good stuff.

208
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,120
Times Iike these,
I wish I had cancer.

209
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,882
So what did she say?

210
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,089
It depends. What did you do,
and who are we talking about?

211
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,559
We both know
that as soon as we talked,
you ran to Stacy

212
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,027
so you could gossip
and giggle.

213
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,394
I need to know what she said.

214
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,956
I have a crazy idea.
Why don't you go talk to her?

215
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,197
Because my bestest buddy
says that could
Iead to trouble.

216
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,335
She sounds confused,
but I don't think she is.

217
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,448
I think she's waiting for you
to do something,
show her you're serious.

218
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,043
Wow.

219
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,355
It's a big jump from
"infidelity is morally wrong"
to "do her."

220
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,892
I didn't say "do her."
I said do something.

221
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,951
What exactly did she say?

222
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,527
She didn't say
it was a mistake.

223
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,669
She's not gonna Ieave Mark
in the middle of his rehab.

224
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,294
Too much guilt.

225
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,871
She Ieft you.

226
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,002

229
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,303
I could've covered this.
You need to get
that test today.

230
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,101
I wish you guys would remember
my birthday
instead of my HIV test.

231
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,735
Forgive us
for being concerned.
I got a bet with House.

232
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,040
He says
you're too scared to get it.
I say you're too anal not to.

233
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,908
I'II cut you in.

234
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,918
CAMERON: That was
a colossal waste.

235
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,977
FOREMAN: Who would've known?

236
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:48,857
Searching a high-end family
home for illicit narcotics
was such an obvious choice.

237

Working moms practically
Iive in their cars.

Mama's Iittle helper.

241
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,037
House, Ritalin.

242
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,449
Cocaine with a PG rating.

243
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,146
Prescribed to her daughter.

244
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,918
Mommy does everything
for her family these days,
even swallows their pills.

245
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,516
It's possible the kid's meds
are the kid's meds.

246
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,585
Pop enough Ritalin,
it can explain everything.

247
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,187
Well, Ritalin maybe explains
some tics, some involuntary...

248
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,631
No, case reports
have referred to chorea.

249
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,192
She's been cut off
from her stash,
so the flailing's tapered off,

250
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,295
the psychosis hasn't returned.
It's perfect.

251
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,169
Tox screen will confirm that.

252
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,732
Half-Iife's 1 2 hours.
Drugs will be
out of her system.

253
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,005
We're done. Get rid of her.
We're not done.

254
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,072
We have to confirm the
diagnosis before we send her
home to die of something else.

00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,745
Oh, yes.

We've asked her three times
if she's on any meds.

00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,166
So we don't ask her.

such a good Iittle girl,

you're the reason
she needs a double martini?

Over here, kiddo.
I'm talking to you. Focus.

are medical pills inside.

A few months ago.

00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,689
What took you so Iong?
It's midnight.

338
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,126
Traffic. Cinco de Mayo.

339
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,187
You owe me $100.

340
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,863
You didn't take the test?

341
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,264
Fear trumps anal every time.

342
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,605
It's not a big deal.
I had the viral Ioad
and antibody test.

343
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,369
It's 99.9%
that I don't have HIV.

344
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,843
And if you have the test,
and it's negative,
you gain a tenth of a point.

345
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,348
But if it's positive you Iose
nearly 100, right?

346
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,649
No arrhythmia,
so Ritalin
isn't the big problem.

347
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,286
Something else is going on.

348
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,789
Fine, Iet's play doctors.

349
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,859
I removed the clot
which caused the stroke.

350
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,393
Problem is,
we don't know
where it came from.

351
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,055
Did ultrasounds of her heart,
arms and Iegs. AII clear.

352
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,688
Could be
a protein C deficiency.

353
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,733
Wouldn't explain
the movement disorder.

354
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,928
Nothing explains everything.

355
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,236
What if
it's a crime syndicate?

356
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,969
Let's say Ritalin
and the fertility meds
plotted a caper.

357
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,977
Ritalin takes care
of the psychosis,
the flailing.

358
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,479
I still don't think Ritalin...

359
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,073
HOUSE: Fertility meds
are competitive by nature.

360
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,017
They had to do
something bigger,
something really unexpected.

361
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,920
Fertility treatments
have been known
to cause endometrial cancer.

362
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,221
Which could cause clots,
which could have caused her
to stroke.

363
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,284
So ultrasound her uterus
this time.

364
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:08,026
See if there's something
growing in there that doesn't
Iook adorable in a onesie.

365
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,932
Cameron. I Iove you.

366
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,068
You'II get your test results
tomorrow.

367
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,954
The prescription
for my heart condition.

368
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,092
A bit on the cheesy side.

369
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,188
I was trying for romantic.

370
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,698
Still fits.

371
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,502
Did you tell Mark?

372
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,709
I told him I had to work Iate.

373
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,582
You gonna tell him?

374
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,021
How am I gonna tell him?

375
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,923
Still working
on that phrasing.
How about,

376
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,057
"You know all the stuff you
were worried about when we
first came here, honey?

377
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,191
"You were right."

378
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,428
Pithy.

379
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,663
Everything's easy
when you don't care
if you hurt anyone.

380
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,205
You already
did the hurting part.

381
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,073
He just doesn't know it yet.
If I never tell him,
it'II never hurt.

382
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,182
I want not to Iove Mark.
I wanna hate you.

383
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,311
I want all of this
to be simple,
but it's not.

384
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,085
You can either
have a Iife with me,

385
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,662
or you can have
a Iife with him.

386
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,693
It can't be both.

387
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,204
It's not easy,
but it is simple.

388
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,115
No endometrial thickening.
No masses.

389
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,247
FOREMAN: No cancer.

390
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,555
She's on fertility treatments.
She had a blood clot.
It's there.

391
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,721
Millions of women
are on fertility treatments
and they don't get cancer.

392
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,662
Right. They get babies.

393
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,723
She had a blood clot
and a stroke.

394
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,497
She'II get another one
and probably die,
if we don't find that tumor.

395
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,935
Do an endometrial biopsy.

396
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:30,907
Biopsy's painful
and unnecessary.
We just did an ultrasound.

397
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,438
What?

398
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:38,480
(HOUSE SHUSHING)
If you have a personal issue
that's interfering with...

399
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,121
What are we waiting for?

400
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,254
Your four weeks just expired.
Your reign of terror is over.

401
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,022
Mine has just begun.

402
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,759
Now go stick a needle
up her hoo-hoo
and find that cancer.

403
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,361
"Hoo-hoo"?

404
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,631
He went to Hopkins.

405
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,336
COMMENTATOR 1 : Pergasaurus
has got 1,500 horsepower blown
and injected with alcohol.

406
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,070
COMMENTATOR 2: Yeah,
that baby really moves.

407
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,045
COMMENTATOR 1 : Oh, yeah, and
the transmission, two-speed
Powerglide. Suspension...

408
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,014
What are you watching?

409
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,045
TV.

410
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,810
What are you doing here?

411
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,085
Ted's with my mom.
He asked the nurse
to watch me.

412
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,284
What nurse?

413
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,554
She's not really watching me.

414
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,694
I got that.

415
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,164
Do you still
have the balloons?

416
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,257
No.

417
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,763
Do you wanna play something?

418
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,099
Nope.

419
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,873
When can Mommy come home?

420
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,415
Don't know.

421
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,146
What's wrong with your foot?

422
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,278
War wound.

423
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:50,378
Does it hurt?

424
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,717
Every day.

425
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,350
Is that why you're so sad?

426
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,624
Oh, aren't you adorable?

427
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,696
I'm not sad, I'm complicated.
Chicks dig that.

428

One day you'II understand.

429
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,560
That's what my parents say
when they don't want me
to know something.

430
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,867
They say that a Iot?

431
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,467
Only when they're talking
about making babies and stuff.

432
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,875
When you catch them fighting?

433
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:15,935
They don't fight.

434
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,072
Not ever?

435
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,178
People who Iove each other
don't fight.

436
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,686
Right. Forgot that.

437
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,118
What floor was that nurse on
who was watching you?

438
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,284
Two.

439
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,159
Good talk.

440
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:38,268
At your age, the type of
uterine cancer that develops
is not Iikely to metastasize.

441
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,394
It's very treatable.

442
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,439
Okay, hold still, Margo.

Yeah.

after I Ieft?

Do you think he's capable
of having a real relationship?

Nothing.

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,158
You probably
just set your rehab
back three months.

510
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,353
Let go. Get off of me!

511
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,507
Liver tumor
doesn't make sense.

512
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,842
You saying the CT was wrong?

513
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:47,578
I'm saying the symptoms
don't add up. A plus B
does not equal Iiver tumor.

514
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,783
We gotta solve for X.

515
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,890
We gotta Iook at this
differently.

516
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,518
What do we know about her?

517
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,721
The side effects
of the Ritalin caused the...

518
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,528
No. We've examined the file
up and down.
Come on, give me that.

519
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,999
Why do you people
always overlook
the human element?

520
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,164
What do we know about her?
Margo...

521
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,576
Dalton. The woman.

522
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,212
She's a people-pleaser.
She doesn't Iike
to Iet people down.

523
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,749
Never fights with her husband.

524
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,218
She turned to drugs
instead of asking for help
to manage her Iife.

525
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,380
So if she can't manage now,

526
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,754
why does she want another kid?

527
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,226
Foreman,
I need your help here.

528
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,327
You wanna pull a bank job,
would you go it alone?

529
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,100
If you gonna rob a home, sure,
that's a one or two man crew.

530
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,574
But a bank,
you need a Iookout,
a getaway driver.

531
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,543
I'm not saying anything
until the metaphor
plays itself out.

532
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,479
So here's the caper.

533
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,610
Fertility meds
create a distraction.

534
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,047
Mommy had three refills
on Ritalin
in the Iast three weeks.

535
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,022
That team goes straight
for the top floor.

536
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:04,721
No trouble taking out
communications, but they need
the specialist, a safecracker.

537
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:08,562
AII he does is stroke,
blood clot, Iiver tumor.

538
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,334
Foreman was right.
This badass
even does flailing.

539
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,832
Come on.

540
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,740
There's only one guy I know
who does that kind of work.

541
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,607
Birth control pills?

542
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,787
While the surgeons
are cutting out
a chunk of your Iiver,

543
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,688
should I have them do
a hysterectomy, too?

544
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,488
A hysterectomy?

545
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,492
I'm trying to get pregnant.

546
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,623
You don't have to Iie to me.
We're not married.

547
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,189
You're Supermom.

548
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,428
You can do anything.

549
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,994
You work seven days a week,
you volunteer,
you raise a kid.

550
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,742
Yet you still
somehow find the time
to Iie to hubby number two

551
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,041
that you really, really wanna
give him a child with his chin
and pretty brown eyes.

552
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,581
What makes you think
that I would...

553
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,741
Because it fits.

554
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:02,479
Birth control pills caused
a hepatocellular adenoma.

555
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,618
Explains all your symptoms
that aren't explained
by your other Iies.

556
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,325
That's it?

557
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,492
AIso...

558
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,191
I'II have the tuna on rye.

559
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,331
Would you Iike
to Ieave my room now?

560
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,064
Your tumor is benign.

561
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,839
Stop taking the pill,
and it will go away
on its own.

562
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,345
I'm canceling the surgery.

563
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,745
What are you
gonna tell my husband?

564
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,079
That I'm canceling
the surgery.

565
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,176
You can do the explaining.

566
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,881
It's tricky, huh?

567
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,751
It's one thing to say
you can't have a baby.

568
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,384
It's another to say
you don't want one.

569
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,088
Personally, I'd make up
some other Iie.

570
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,524
Could...

571
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,590
Could I die on the table?

572
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,132
Could you die
if you tell him the truth?

573
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,172
I need this surgery.

574
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,309
I'm not on the pill.

575
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,475
You can't cancel the surgery.

576
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,385
If she goes off the pill,
the tumor
goes away on its own.

577
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,582
You have no proof
the birth control pills
caused this.

578
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,056
You have no proof
she's even taking them.

579
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,525
If we do the surgery
maybe we'II kill her
on the table.

580
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,357
Then I can prove
I'm right at the autopsy.

581
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,024
Or we can forget the surgery,
Iet the tumor grow,
and kill her.

582
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,264
Why don't you take it up
with Stacy, see which option
minimizes your risk?

583
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,306
Here's what I think
she's gonna say,
"Oh, I Iove Greg.

584
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,207
"But if you go against
the patient's wishes,
you're calling her a Iiar.

585
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,471
"And if something goes wrong,
I end up in court

586
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,912
"having to defend
the big mean doctor,
albeit with dreamy eyes,

587
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,177
"who wouldn't believe
the nice suburban mom.

588
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,051
"And even though
his cane makes me melt,
do the damn surgery."

589
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,749
HOUSE: Shocking.

590
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,255
It's benign.

591
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,255
People do
crazy things for Iove.

592
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:27,263
No, crazy is hanging out
in the park all day
talking to pigeons.

593
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,593
Margo knows what she's doing.

594
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,430
She gave up half her Iiver
to save her marriage.

595
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:37,133
No, she surgically removed her
fingerprints
to cover her pathetic Iie.

596
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,706
It's twisted and manipulative.
I get that. But it's also

597
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,345
romantic.

598
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,485
I'm barely willing
to put the seat down
after I pee.

599
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:52,916
Do we need to talk?

600
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,582
Nope. I'm fine.

601
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,597
So the surgeon
got the whole tumor,
and it was benign.

602
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:05,727
That's good, right?

603
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:06,861
Yeah, benign is good.

604
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,374
How could a benign tumor
have caused all the symptoms?

605
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,336
We believe
all your wife's symptoms
will go away now.

606
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,746
Oh, thank God.

607
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,174
Look,
I'm gonna pick up Stella.

608
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,118
I'II call you
after I get the babysitter.

609
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,386
Dr. Foreman,

610
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,691
you can help me.

611
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,962
You could tell my husband that

612
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,635
because of all this,

613
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,209
I can't take
any more fertility treatments.

614
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,375
Confidentiality rules stop me
from telling your husband
the truth.

615
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,111
But my obligation to Iie
ends there.

616
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,725
Are there...

617
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:09,325
Is there a birth control
method, something
that won't make me sick?

618
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,364
Margo,
you're gonna have risks
with everything,

619
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,200
especially
if you're not telling
your fertility doctor.

620
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:19,403
If you keep doing this,
it's gonna kill your marriage
and kill you.

621
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,736
You don't know.

622
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,206
In a few years,

623
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,908
we'II give up.

624
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,520
Stop trying to get pregnant.

625
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,752
We'II hug, cry.

626
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:40,328
Eventually Ted will stop
thinking about it, and he'II
appreciate Stella even more.

627
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,992
And we'II Iive
happily together
for the next 50 years.

628
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,748
Something you need to see.

629
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,662
Knowing is always better
than not knowing.

630
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,712
It's a referral request.

631
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,974
Right.

632
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,883
The HIV thing came in earlier.

633
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,885
You're fine.

634
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,655
You won't read your mail,
but you'II open mine?

635
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,591
It said "confidential,"
and I wanted to know.

636
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:47,061
The most important Ietter
of my Iife,
and you're still an ass.

637
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,195
Comforting, isn't it?

Hey.

00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,729
Hi.

641
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,476
I'm gonna talk to Mark
tonight, and I'm gonna
stay here with you.

642
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,289
Don't do it.

643
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,257
This isn't funny, Greg.

644
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,522
I know.

645
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,793
You

646
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,767
spent all these months
chasing me.

647
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,741
Now I'm here
and you start running?
What the hell changed?

648
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,672
Nothing.

649
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,571
Nothing changes.

650
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:12,809
I'm not gonna change.

651
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,510
Who asked you to?

652
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,283
Mark is willing to do
whatever it takes.

653
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,186
I'm not.

654
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,490
Never was.

655
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:28,120
Now you're introspective?
Weren't so analytical
the other night.

656
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,233
You were happy with Mark.
You'II be happy again.

657
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,497
Shut up about Mark.
What the hell
is wrong with you?

658
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,300
I can't make you happy!

659
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,465
What?

660
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,568
How do you think
this is gonna end?

661
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,772
We'II be happy, for what?
A few weeks? A few months?

662
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,513
And then I'II...

663
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,421
I'II say something insensitive
or I'II

664
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,125
start ignoring you.
And at first it'II be okay.

665
00:39:57,194 --> 00:40:00,220
It's just House being House.
And then,

666
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,925
at some point,
you will need something more.

667
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,467
You'II need someone
who can give you
something I can't.

668

00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,116
It doesn't have to be.

671
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,549
It does.

672
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:27,986
It does.

673
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,458
I don't wanna go there again.

674
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,598

00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,266
Six months, tops.

679
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:14,429
I'II take that bet.
It's the perfect marriage.

680
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:18,474
There's nothing to fight over
if you never
talk about anything.

681
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,505
What did you tell her?

682
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,611
I told her
she's better off without me.

683
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,978
That's probably true.

684
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,551
You're an idiot.

685
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,723
You don't think
she'd be better off
without you.

686
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,889
Right.
I sent her off on a whim.

687
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,900
You have no idea
why you sent her off!

688
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,903
Don't do this.
This was no great sacrifice!

689
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,405
You sent her away because
you've got to be miserable!

690
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,035
This kind of psycho-crap
help get your patients
through the Iong nights?

691
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,476
Or is it just for you?

692
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,414
Tough Iove make you feel good?
Helping people
feel their pain?

693
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,712
You don't Iike yourself.

694
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,288
But you do admire yourself.

695
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,520
It's all you've got,
so you cling to it.

696
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:48,929
You're so afraid
if you change, you'II Iose
what makes you special.

697
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:57,797
Being miserable
doesn't make you better
than anybody else, House.

698
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,169
It just makes you miserable.
