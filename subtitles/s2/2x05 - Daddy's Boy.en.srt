00:00:03,874 --> 00:00:08,693
Mr. Hall:
Ha ha ha...ha ha ha.
I oughta have this framed.

2
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:12,080
My last bill from Princeton.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,020
And I thought
we were celebrating the fact that
I actually graduated.

4
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:17,563
I always knew
you'd be able to graduate.

5
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:20,759
What I didn't know was whether
I would be able to pay for it.

6
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:21,910
[Chuckles]

7
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:23,478
Your mom...

8
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,883
She'd be so proud of you.

9
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:28,299
You always say that.

10
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:30,373
I'm so proud of you.

11
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,403
Always was.

12
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,509
Come on, Dad.
You're gonna cry.

13
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:39,703
[Laughs]
You wanna be embarrassed?

14
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,925
You got it. Ahhh.

15
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,448
[Chuckle]

16
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,349
Look, um, don't party
too hard tonight.

17
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,553
Your grandmother wants a picture
of you getting that sheepskin.

18
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,060
And it'd be nice if you didn't
look completely hung over.

19
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,348
Ooh, no, don't worry.

20
00:00:58,348 --> 00:01:01,739
I've had enough alcohol
in the past week to last me
another four years.

21
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:04,787
- Good...I think.
- [Laughs]

Whoo!

28
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:30,207
Right!

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,419
Carnell:
You are the man!

30
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:34,345
Tell me something
I don't know!

31
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:35,521
[Shock-like sound]
Ow! Ow, ow!

32
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:36,996
Ow.

33
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:39,571
- That's not funny, man.
- What?

34
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:40,812
Yeah right.
You shocked me.

35
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:42,538
With what?
I got nothing.

36
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,962
[Shock-like sound]

37
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:50,157
All right, whoever's doing that
better cut it out! Ow!

38
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:53,189
[Shock and sparkling  sounds]

39
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:55,219
Ow!

40
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,746
What the hell's going on?

41
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:01,342
Maybe there's a short somewhere.
The floor's covered with beer.

42
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:03,889
No way. The outlet's a GFI,
plus he's got rubber-soled shoes on.

43
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,500
[Short sound again]

44
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:06,617
Ow!

45
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:09,346
Taddy:
Somebody call 911!

00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:16,512
2x05 - Daddy's Boy

47
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,880
Original Airdate (FOX): 8-NOV-2005

48
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:54,233
Wilson:
Patient experiences
shock-like sensations

49
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,484
as well as headaches,
nausea, and drowsiness.

50
00:02:58,484 --> 00:02:59,758
Chase: Shocks?

51
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:01,948
Excruciatingly painful shocks.

52
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:06,323
ER docs referred him to a neurologist,
who referred him to five other doctors
in the last seven days.

53
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:09,213
Shocks could be Lhermitte's Sign,
early symptom of MS.

54
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:11,407
No, MRI showed
no white matter lesions, and

55
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,861
the shocks aren't
accompanied by neck flexing.

56
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:14,984
Good morning.

57
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:16,129
It's almost noon.

58
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:18,171
Really? That must be
why I'm so hungry.

59
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:19,361
Who's up for lunch?

60
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:20,798
What's with the jacket?

61
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:24,532
It keeps me warm and cool.
How does it know?

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,953
Wilson:
We're discussing your new patient.

63
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:28,989
It must be a boring discussion seeing
as I haven't accepted a new patient.

64
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,151
You accepted him
the moment I loaned you five grand.

65
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:33,939
Oh, wait, wait.

66
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,670
When I said
I'd do anything for the money,
obviously I didn't mean it.

67
00:03:36,754 --> 00:03:39,217
You're gonna like this.
The kid's getting shocked
every few minutes.

68
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:40,981
Cameron:
Why would you need $5,000?

69
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:43,772
Bad night at poker or
a great night with a hooker?

70
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:48,322
Thank you for saving me
the trouble of deflecting
that personal question with a joke.

71
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,577
College student?

72
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:52,963
Nitrous Oxide's fun at parties...

73
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:56,500
Can cause the shocks, and
drinking till you puke every night
can cause everything else.

74
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:57,430
Give him some B12.

75
00:03:57,514 --> 00:04:01,105
Been there, done that.
Also ruled out cancer,
MS, pyridoxine toxicity,

76
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:03,190
and all the popular neuropathies.

77
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,793
- Cervical spondylosis?
- Doesn't explain the low white count.

78
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:08,323
He's black.

79
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,446
I'm assuming
he's not just really dirty,
but is of African descent.

80
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,084
Which means
he'd have a lower white count.

81
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:15,351
- Not this low.
- He's a wrestler.

82
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,255
Probably uses
diuretics to cut weight.

83
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:18,633
It can also cause
low white count.

84
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,527
- Not this low.
- Not this low.

85
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:22,316
- Behcet's.
- No skin lesions.

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,072
- Cervical herpes roster myelitis.
- No external outbreak.

87
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:30,364
Something's missing.

88
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:31,542
Find out what it is.

89
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:33,696
Uh, I don't even know
what that means.

90
00:04:33,777 --> 00:04:38,030
Well, figure it out, find it out,
and then find me. I'll be at lunch.

91
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:39,811
Carnell:
No ideas?

92
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:41,447
Cameron:
Lots of ideas.

93
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,884
Too many ideas.
That's why so many tests.

94
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,377
Have you used
any recreational drugs?

95
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:51,402
What?

96
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:53,586
I'm gonna get mad at you
for getting stoned?

97
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:56,465
Not today. Not here.

98
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:02,195
Um, at Christmas
one of the guys had
some ecstasy, I mean,

99
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,062
it was...Ah!

100
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,153
Ah!

101
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:11,352
Son of a bitch. Ow.

102
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,713
ANA is negative
for lupus...again.

103
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:21,399
House wants more information,
not the same information
done over again.

104
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:22,500
"Find what's missing"?

105
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:25,146
For all we know
the kid is dying, and
he's giving us riddles?

106
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:27,691
Did a more detailed history,
went back three generations.

107
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:29,412
- And?
- His mom died in a car accident.

108
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:34,146
His mom's mom had arthritis,
His mom's mom's dad served in an
all-black tank battalion under Patton.

109
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,420
Fascinating.

110
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:36,859
If it's not a tumor,
it has to be MS.

111
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:37,944
Wilson already ruled out...

112
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:40,326
MRI can't rule out MS
100% of the time.

113
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:41,929
MS doesn't explain
a low white count.

114
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,403
Alcoholism does.

115
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:47,274
On admission his BAC was 2.0.
Liver enzymes off the chart.

116
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:48,471
It was graduation weekend.

117
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:50,181
He barely drank
in the weeks before that.

118
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:52,683
And he didn't drink at all
during his wrestling season.

119
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,830
- If you believe him.
- I did a tox screen...

120
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:57,512
It doesn't matter
if she believes him or not.
It's already in the chart.

121
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:59,494
We're supposed to
find out what's missing.

122
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:10,398
Well this...
this is perfect.

123
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:12,676
Invite me to dinner
Thursday night.

124
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:15,775
Come on.
We haven't had a nice meal
together since, oh...

125
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:19,489
Yesterday
when I loaned you
$5,000 to buy a new car.

126
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,661
My treat.

127
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:25,833
Two-wheeled vehicles that
travel 150 miles an hour...

128
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,023
don't really go well with
crippled irresponsible drug addicts.

129
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:32,569
Actually, two-wheeled vehicles
that go 180 miles an hour...

130
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,240
do not go well with
healthy, responsible architects

131
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:37,364
who don't know how to
separate braking and turning.

132
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:39,831
The good news is
it brings the price right down.

133
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:41,238
You're taking it back.

134
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:42,624
Mom.

135
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:45,005
How 'bout we talk
about this over dinner?

136
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:47,189
Forget dinner.
You're gonna kill yourself?

137
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:49,066
Chase:
Nice bike.

138
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,011
Thank you.
See, that's how you do it.

139
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:53,865
Compliments, dinner.

140
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:56,126
What do you with your cane?

141
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:58,413
He buys me dinner,
he'll find out.

142
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,909
Evel Knievel had
the same set up.

143
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:06,593
And he broke
every bone in his body.

144
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,929
We went through
all the imaging studies and
redid the blood cultures and...

145
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:11,417
[Starts the engine]
I don't want hand-me-downs.

146
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,117
I want brand new stuff.

147
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:15,009
There's nothing...
[Guns the motor]

148
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,004
There's nothing missing!

149
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,741
Sorry, I didn't
catch that last part.

150
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,006
There's n...

151
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:22,372
There's n...
[Guns the motor again]

152
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:29,891
There's nothing
else we can do.

153
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,032
- You check the police report?
- On what?

154
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:34,618
- On his mom's car accident.
- It was 15 years ago.

155
00:07:34,702 --> 00:07:36,029
The kid wasn't even in the car.

156
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:39,623
She veered off a straight,
dry road in broad daylight.
That doesn't seem odd  to you?

157
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:42,344
She probably
got distracted changing
radio stations or something.

158
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,794
That's what the police thought.

159
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:48,880
Of course they didn't know that
she has a family member who is frequently
incapacitated by shock-like sensations.

160
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,912
A genetic component
seems unlikely.

161
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,142
But it's interesting.

162
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:54,594
A type two neurofibromatosis
could cause the shock.

163
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:56,209
You knew this was missing?

164
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,771
I knew something was missing.
Maybe this. Maybe something else.

165
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:02,270
Get a DNA analysis of
the long arm of chromosome 22.

167

[Cut the engine]

168
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:08,639
You'd rather have dinner
with your wife?

169
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,032
Yes, I would...

170
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,998
if she were speaking to me.

171
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,480
Unlike her, I could
make it worth your while.

172
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:19,083
Fine.

173
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,140
Should I drive?

174
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,679
Ah... no.

175
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:27,772
And I'm not letting you in my car
until I see your wallet.

176
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,661
NF2,
it's an inherited disease.

177
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,776
It could cause
abnormal growths
on the cranial nerves.

178
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,718
It would explain
the shocks and other symptoms.

179
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:42,920
DNA analysis will show whether your son
has the specific chromosome mutation
which causes the disease.

180
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,849
But if it's inherited,
that means someone else
in our family would have it.

181
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,543
We think
your wife may have had it.

182
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,148
No, she never had
any sort of health problems.

183
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:52,651
No odd-looking freckles?
Nodules in the iris?

184
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,921
Nothing. I mean,
why would you think she was sick?

185
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:57,962
We think it may have been
what caused her car accident.

186
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:00,819
Wait, what do you mean?
My mom's car was hit
by a drunk driver.

187
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:03,753
That's not what
the police report indicated.

188
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:07,129
Well, you must have
gotten the wrong report.

189
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,267
No.

190
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:10,959
They didn't.

191
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:19,478
[Sighs]
When you started driving...

192
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,870
I, um...

193
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,493
You lied about
how mom died?

194
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:26,795
I figured if her death could
somehow mean something...

195
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,883
How's lying about it
mean something?

196
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,413
Carnell:
How could you
use her like that, dad?

197
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:32,342
Her death?

198
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:33,767
I was just trying
to protect you.

199
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:35,310
What else isn't true?

200
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,690
Carnell:
She wasn't a teacher.
You just wanted me to read?

201
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,256
What's that smell?

202
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:42,569
I don't smell...

203
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:47,603
We're gonna need a nurse.

204
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,036
- What the hell?
- It's okay.

205
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,826
We'll take care of it.

206
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,816
You didn't feel anything?

207
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,046
No.

208
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,618
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

209
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:00,452
But you didn't
feel any of this?

210
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,619
No.

211
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:17,784
Sphincter paralysis plus shocks
equals Miller Fisher Syndrome.

212
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,465
Not if you add the stool sample,
which is negative for C.jejuni.

213
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,647
He lied to his son
about how his mom died?

214
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:25,359
Cameron:
He was just protecting him.

215
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:26,793
Manipulating him.

216
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:27,859
That's what parents do.

217
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:29,556
They lie to us
because they love us.

218
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:30,793
Who's getting teary?

219
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:32,323
Mom's death is irrelevant.

220
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:35,754
DNA revealed no NF2 markers
or any other inherited disease.

221
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:38,379
Apparently, she really did fall asleep at the wheel.

222
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:41,214
So what exactly
are we talking about here?

223
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:45,151
A little peeker or
did the prairie dog
actually come out to play?

224
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:46,014
Excuse me?

225
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,792
We talking explosive?

226
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:51,011
The hemoccult was
negative for blood.
[Phone rings]

227
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:55,821
And I wouldn't say
he actually exploded.
More like gushed.

228
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:56,587
Good.

229
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:58,153
We're getting somewhere.

230
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,869
Yeah? Where?

231
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,745
[Phone rings again]
I have no idea.

232
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:02,451
Of course.

233
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:03,575
Love the riddles.

234
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:04,771
[On phone]
Hello? Hi, Mom.

235
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:09,378
Look, I have a business dinner
on Thursday night.
I can't get out of.

236
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:12,639
I know.
I really wanted to see you too.

237
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,367
Actually, can I call you back?
I'm in a meeting right now.

238
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:18,962
Okay, thanks.

239
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:21,753
Cameron:
Who was that?

240
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:23,364
Angelina Jolie.

241
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:24,515
I call her mom.

242
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:26,129
Who thinks that's sexy?

243
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:28,870
So explosive or gushing?

244
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,277
She never calls here.
Is everything okay?

245
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:34,071
Great. Yeah.

246
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:36,459
My dad's taking her to Europe.

247
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:38,998
They got a nine-hour layover
in Newark on Thursday.

248
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,231
If it's gastrointestinal...

249
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:42,422
You lied to avoid
seeing your own mom?

250
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:43,710
Are you kidding?

251
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:45,575
I can't lie to my mom.

252
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,226
Seriously, I can't.

253
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,726
Wilson's invited me to dinner.

254
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,233
It would be rude to stand up a guy
who just loaned me five grand.

255
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:52,907
Transverse myelitis?

256
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:55,653
It causes numbness,
anal sphincter dysfunction.

257
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:56,701
And the shocks.

258
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:59,424
Thank you for taking
no interest in my mother.

259
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:03,224
That begs the question,
what caused the transverse myelitis?

260
00:12:03,294 --> 00:12:05,621
We've ruled out
cancer and MS.

261
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:06,902
Leaves infection.

262
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:08,467
If there was infection,
there'd be a fever.

263
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:10,625
And his blood and CSF cultures
are already negative.

264
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,814
Maybe the infection's gone,
but the memory remains.

265
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:16,266
Molecular mimicry.

266
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,387
Nice.

267
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:21,561
Okay, get an immunoglobulin level
and electrophoresis.

268
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:27,082
You're good, my friend.

269
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,481
I'm sure we'll meet again.

270
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,395
You really think that was
his mom on the phone?

271
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:34,758
Probably, I don't know
why he'd lie about that.

272
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,238
Who cares?

273
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:38,815
You're not the least bit curious
what his parents are like?

274
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,332
I'm sure
his mom's a piece of work.

275
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,148
Only a mother could
do that much damage.

276
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:44,078
My bet's he was born
the way he is.

277
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:46,376
Probably tormented his parents,
not the other way around.

278
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,808
He was either a fast runner
or one hell of a fighter.

279
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,128
Where you going?

280
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:52,814
You guys handling
the test, right?

281
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:02,652
Is there something important
that you and House need
to discuss over dinner?

282
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:06,611
Other than the skyrocketing
interest rates on personal loans?

283
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:09,423
You know,
this is the fourth time
I've loaned him money.

284
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,637
Not lunch money...
money, money.

285
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,029
House's parents?

286
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,317
They have a layover
in Newark Thursday evening.

287
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:20,031
[Sighs]
I'm canceling dinner.

288
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:25,475
No, I thought
maybe you could just
invite a few more people.

289
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:29,878
Foreman:
An infectious agent's molecular structure
can resemble the spinal cord's.

290
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:34,240
When the immune system
attacks infection ends up
attacking spinal cords as well.

291
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,285
So he has an infection.

292
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:37,481
They just said I don't.

293
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:41,692
Even after the infection is gone,
it goes right on attacking
because the spinal cord is still there.

294
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:42,555
Is there a treatment?

295
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,868
Depends on
what the original infection was.

296
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:45,919
All right, you're done.

297
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,975
You need to lay flat
after a lumbar puncture
for about an hour.

298
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:51,476
I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

299
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,066
Hey Dad, can you
get me a coke please?

300
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,469
Yeah, that usually helps.

301
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:58,848
You're done.

302
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:01,368
If you're nauseous...

303
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:04,269
No, I'm not nauseous.
I just want him outta here.

304
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:06,309
He's your dad.
He's gonna be around.

305
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:08,440
Yeah, I know.

306
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:11,490
It's not that, it's...

307
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:16,411
Are these people
completely incapable of
telling the truth to each other?

308
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,206
He went to Jamaica
with his friends.

309
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,572
[Sighs]
No wonder he lied.

310
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:22,576
Children aren't supposed
to have good times.

311
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,502
One of his friends
flew them down.

312
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,073
Carnell's dad has
this thing about him
accepting stuff from rich friends.

313
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,902
Wants him to
remember who he is,
and where he came from.

314
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:31,893
Where have you been?

315
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:33,452
Making dinner plans.

316
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:34,566
What's up?

317
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:39,914
The boys have uncovered
the shocking fact that the patient has
a crappy relationship with his dad.

318
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:41,171
They seem to actually care.

319
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:44,755
Well, I don't.
There's only one reason
any kid with a plane flies to Jamaica.

320
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,033
It wasn't for marijuana.

321
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:47,160
He doesn't do
anything but drink.

322
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:48,549
He said that
to you or his pops?

323
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,459
Tox screen was
negative for THC.

324
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,920
Spring break was
over a month ago.

325
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,596
Even pot would have
washed out by now.

326
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:58,536
Even if he'd smoked,
no way marijuana causes
transverse myelitis?

327
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,292
True, but the stuff
that they put on it does.

328
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:02,924
Pesticides.

329
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,067
Why would he come
clean about the trip,
but lie about smoking pot?

330
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:08,798
He wouldn't necessarily
have to smoke to
get pesticide poisoning.

331
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:12,819
He could have eaten fruit that
had been sprayed or been exposed
through his skin on a hike.

332
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:14,358
Or he could have smoked it.

333
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:15,530
A lot of it.

334
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,040
And lied about it. Because
that's what this family does.

335
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:19,917
Start him on
IV pralidoxime.

336
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:23,388
Two grams per liter, then
one gram every eight hours
until you see some improvement.

337
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,411
You have no evidence to
support a poisoning diagnosis.

338
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:29,476
Which is why
it's gonna be so cool
when I turn out to be right.

339
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:33,549
Cameron.

340
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,340
Who are you making
dinner plans with?

341
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:38,724
No one.

342
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:45,264
House:
You bastard.

343
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:49,231
You invited
my parents to dinner.

344
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,144
Jeez, Cameron's
got a big mouth.

345
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:53,572
Ha, not as big as yours.

346
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:56,832
Hey, you used me to
avoid seeing your parents.

347
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:57,641
What do you care?

348
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:00,260
I don't,
I just thought it might be
interesting to find out why.

349
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:01,522
You could have just asked.

350
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:02,881
You would have lied.

351
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,436
And you would have believed me,
which would have kept us both happy.

352
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:10,122
You want your money back?
Is that what this is about?

353
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:11,174
No!

354
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,769
Wait...well...

355
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,636
have you got the money?

356
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:22,742
If you have the money, then
why did you need the loan?

357
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:23,512
I didn't.

358
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,221
I just wanted to
see if you'd give it to me.

359
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:29,499
I've been borrowing
increasing amounts ever since
you lent me $40 a year ago.

360
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,730
A little experiment
to see where you draw the line.

361
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:40,161
You're...you're trying to
objectively measure
how much I value our friendship?

362
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:41,223
It's five grand.

363
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,944
You got nothing
to be ashamed of.

364
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:44,030
So what do you say?

365
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:47,587
One little phone call,
one big check.

366
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:50,401
Fine.

367
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:53,004
Thanks.

368
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:57,564
Now be a grownup and
either tell mommy and daddy
you don't want to see them,

369
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:59,733
or I'm picking you up
at 7:00 for dinner.

370
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:01,683
What do you mean?

371
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:03,508
- You just said that...
- I lied.

372
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:08,905
I've been lying to you in
increasing amounts ever since I told you
you looked good unshaved a year ago.

373
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:13,294
It's a little experiment, you know,
see where you draw the line.

374
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:19,540
Cuddy:
How's the patient?

375
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:20,967
Haven't been in yet today.

376
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,099
As long as he hasn't
gotten any worse.

377
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:28,266
You're treating him
for pesticide poisoning
without any proof of pesticides.

378
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,987
We're gonna
have a hell of a time
explaining that to our lawyer.

379
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,028
I told House not to...

380
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,039
Wow.

381
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,199
Lawyer's not
gonna believe this.

382
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:43,521
Ha, ha, ha.
He's got his appetite back.

383
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,885
Whatever you did,
it's working.

384
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:49,008
He is healthy.
Swallow is forgiven.

385
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:50,327
Now I'm feeling nauseous.

386
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:51,956
He is not healthy.

387
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,171
Nausea and diarrhea
were not his only symptoms.

388
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:57,246
- Shocks have also decreased.
- But not disappeared.

389
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,905
And he's out of the diaper,
which is good news for everyone.

390
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:01,646
What about
his low white count?

391
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:04,415
The little buggers
need time to grow.

392
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,095
Don't worry,
our wrestling Rastafarian
will be back on his feet

393
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:11,310
and sneaking around
behind pop's back again in no time.

394
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,366
[Phone's ringing]
Yeah.

395
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,120
Check it again.

396
00:18:19,035 --> 00:18:20,321
I'll be right there.

397
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:21,877
What happened?

398
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:26,257
Apparently I can save
money by switching to
another long-distance carrier.

399
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:27,652
Oh, I was right, wasn't I?

400
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:30,851
Oh yeah, it's always
about you, isn't it?

401
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,314
Cameron:
He has the chills and
his temperature is spiking.

402
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:34,496
It's nearly 106.

403
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:36,755
What's that mean?
I mean, what's happened?

404
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:40,350
You want the truth?
Do you want me to make
something up to protect you?

405
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:42,223
We think a drunk driver
broke into his room.

406
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:43,895
What's happening to my son?

407
00:18:46,397 --> 00:18:49,242
The truth is I have no idea.

408
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:01,464
There's the fever that
Cameron was looking for.

409
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,810
We knew if it was myelitis
there had to be an "itis."

410
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:05,689
This must be the infection
that set it off.

411
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,068
Yeah,
except in this universe
effect follows cause.

412
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:10,071
I've complained about it, but...

413
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:12,594
- Maybe the tests were wrong.
- No, the tests were right.

414
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:14,773
Yesterday he had
no fever, no infection.

415
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:18,074
So he just happened to
catch a bug while he was here?
That's all this is?

416
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,513
Yeah, because his
white blood cell count was down,
he was vulnerable.

417
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:24,894
Because it's really down,
it might kill him,
but that's all this is.

418
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:26,757
Is he still pooping his pants?

419
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:28,319
He just started again.

420
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:29,315
Again?

421
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:31,255
It stopped when
he was getting better.

422
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:33,988
He was feeling better.

423
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,540
He was never getting better.

424
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:39,139
So all we have to answer is
what causes a 22-year-old kid

425
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:42,320
to become immuno-compromised
with GI involvement and shocks?

426
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:44,140
That stop and start
for no apparent reason.

427
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:46,645
We need to find an answer
before this infection kills him.

428
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,311
Yeah, that'd be the ideal.

429
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,099
You, intravenous broad
spectrum antibiotics.

430
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:54,870
You get a cervical thoracic
and lumbar T2 weighted
fast spin echo MRIs.

431
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:58,058
And you, track down
all those Richie Riches
who went to Jamaica.

432
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:01,448
See if any of them got
the shocks, the trots, or the hots.

433
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:04,750
The hots, it's fever.

434
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,342
[Elevator dings]

435
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:08,581
You guys gonna join us
for dinner Thursday?

436
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,785
Um, gotta do my laundry.

437
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,658
You're not curious?

438
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:15,847
Curious about crocs, but I don't
stick my head in their mouths.

439
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,322
I'm out too.

440
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,784
House is a freak.

441
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:21,616
There's no virus
that causes that,
no DNA mutation.

442
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,294
You're gonna have
one dinner with two people.

443
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:26,500
60 minutes,
most of it spent chewing,
talking about the weather.

444
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:27,872
Unless they something like,

445
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:32,876
"Do you prefer the Chardonnay or
the Merlot...we kept Greg locked
in the closet for 17 years",

446
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,482
you're not gonna
learn anything.

447
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,693
Cameron: Okay.

448
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:39,659
We'd like to talk to some of your friends,
see if they have any similar symptoms.

449
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:42,215
The doctors in the ER
already asked me that.

450
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,495
Cameron:
We understand.

451
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,837
But they didn't have all
the information that we have now.

452
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,362
What kind of information?

453
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:53,338
Would you mind if I spoke
with Carnell alone for a minute?

454
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:56,158
- Is this bad news?
- No.

455
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:58,021
It's just confidential.

456
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,876
Why is something
suddenly confidential?

457
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,191
I mean, if you know
something about my son,
I need to know what's going on.

458
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:06,813
I'm sorry.
I have to insist.

459
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:08,198
I'm his father.

460
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,948
And if I'm going to
take care of him,
I need to know the truth.

461
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:12,379
Dad.

462
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,609
She wants to know
who I went to Jamaica with.

463
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:18,418
You never been to Jamaica.

464
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:21,634
Taddy's dad flew a bunch of us
down over spring break.

465
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:27,411
You told me
you had two papers to
write over the break.

466
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:31,124
'Cause I didn't
wanna come home
and work my ass off.

467
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:35,429
I wanted to
take an actual break
during the break for once.

468
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,277
I shouldn't have lied to you.

469
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:44,243
No, what you shoulda done is
come home instead of
partying with your rich friends.

470
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,002
I'm sorry.
We need those names.

471
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:53,983
Cuddy:
What do you want?

472
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,190
To apologize.

473
00:21:56,442 --> 00:22:01,572
I realize that my attention to the clinic
has been somewhat lax of late,
and I want to make amends.

474
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,293
How 'bout tomorrow night?
I take the night shift.

475
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,026
The clinic's closed at night.

476
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:08,678
Yeah, but I'm sure there's
plenty of things to be done.

477
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,398
There's charts to be reviewed,
supplies inventoried...

478
00:22:11,482 --> 00:22:12,775
Dinners avoided.

479
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:16,133
- You're going too?
- I love their Cobb salad.

480
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:19,238
[Sighs]
Give me a reason
to get out of this,

481
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:22,919
and I'll tell you
who started the rumor
about you being a transsexual.

482
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:24,760
There is no such rumor.

483
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,437
There will be unless you
get me out of this dinner.

484
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:28,987
No one's making you
do this, House.

485
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:32,063
Just do what everybody else does,
lie to them.

486
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:34,518
- You lie to your mother?
- Only since I was 12.

487
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:36,664
My mom's a human polygraph.

488
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:39,146
My dad should be taking her
to Vegas, not the Louvre.

489
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,285
Trust me, your mom would
much rather think you have a
business meeting than you hate her.

490
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:46,308
I don't hate her.

491
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,136
I hate HIM.

492
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,792
Taddy:
We all had headaches,
nausea, vomiting.

493
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:55,866
You know, we figured
it was connected to the
massive amounts of drinking.

494
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,330
Or you think
what happened to Carnell has
something to do with the trip?

495
00:22:59,473 --> 00:23:00,427
Don't know.

496
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:03,790
You haven't had any
unexplained pain or strange feelings
since you got back?

497
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:06,448
Nope, except for a little
athlete's foot, I'm fine.

498
00:23:06,938 --> 00:23:08,159
Can I see it?

499
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:10,774
- See what?
- Your feet.

500
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:17,137
There's a common parasite
in Jamaica that can
resemble foot fungus.

501
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:19,903
It's not really my feet.

502
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:22,875
You know, I figured
fungus is fungus.

503
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:26,420
It's my groin.

504
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:30,240
I'm going to need
to take a look at that.

505
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:31,383
Now?

506
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:33,331
Unless you wanna come down
to the hospital with me.

507
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:35,821
No, I can't, I mean,
I just started two days ago,

508
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:38,400
- and we're right in the
middle of a big merg...
-Then drop your pants.

509
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:55,239
[Door opens]
Reilly, I need the...

510
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:57,115
What the hell's going on here?

511
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:58,120
She's a doctor.

512
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,631
I'm a doctor.
He has a rash.

513
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:00,894
- And a friend of his...
- Right.

514
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:03,130
Well, as soon as she's
done treating your rash,

515
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:04,747
I need the numbers
on D-Port Technology.

516
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:05,737
Yes, Sir.

517
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:09,627
And Doctor, why don't you
leave a card on your way out?

518
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,628
Except for one guy with a rash
no one else on the trip has any health issues.

519
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:22,435
What kind of rash?

520
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,846
I don't know.
I took some scrapings.
It doesn't appear to be ringworm.

521
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,768
What did it look like?
Aside from not ringworm.

522
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,536
Basically like diaper rash.

523
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,732
He's been working
around the clock.

524
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:33,613
Said he hasn't changed
his clothes in three days.

525
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,667
Kaposi's sarcoma can
look like diaper rash.

526
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:37,380
Any discoloration
around the edges?

527
00:24:37,464 --> 00:24:39,584
Get him in here.
We all wanna take a look.

528
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:41,453
Even if it is Kaposi's,
it's not related.

529
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,178
The patient doesn't have
any skin symptoms, and

530
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:44,703
we've already
ruled out cancer.

531
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:48,197
What are the odds of
two friends who've just returned
from a trip outside the country

532
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:51,522
coming down with
unexplained, but unrelated illnesses?
Get him in here.

533
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:53,873
He won't come.
Just started a new job
after graduation.

534
00:24:53,957 --> 00:24:55,185
They're working
on some big merger.

535
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,420
Tell him his friend's life
hangs in the balance.

536
00:24:57,504 --> 00:24:59,237
That's what I told him
the first time.

537
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:01,408
Still wound up
driving into Manhattan.

538
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:04,073
Tell him his life
hangs in the balance.

539
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:05,930
Tell him the rash
is flesh-eating,

540
00:25:06,014 --> 00:25:09,254
and the next course on the menu
is his frank and beans.

541
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:13,907
Where is Stacy?

542
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,413
Uh, speaking at a
conference in Baltimore.

543
00:25:16,497 --> 00:25:17,188
Why? What do you need?

544
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:18,367
Can I subpoena a patient.

545
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:20,638
House wants me to lie
to the kid to get him in here.

546
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:22,865
Well, then you'll be
the one getting the subpoena.

547
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:25,399
Well, we do need him
to diagnose his friend.

548
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:26,632
Take the test to the kid.

549
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:29,095
There is no test.
House just wants to look at it.

550
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:30,803
Then take House to it.

551
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:32,702
Yeah, like that's
gonna happen.

552
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,513
Tell House
his parents called.

553
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,924
Said they were
coming in early.

554
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:40,611
He'll go anywhere
just to avoid them.

555
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:45,910
So it's okay to lie to House,
but not to a patient?

556
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:48,410
Yep.
[Beeper goes off]

557
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:53,424
- Ahh! - What's wrong?
- His stomach's getting a lot worse.

558
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:54,299
Ahh!

559
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:55,558
He's rigid.

560
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:02,148
- Ahh!
- He's bleeding into his abdomen.

561
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:03,126
- Ahh!
- Cameron: What's going on?

562
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,883
- We need a surgeon
and an O.R., stat.
- On it.

563
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:06,885
Ah!

564
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,204
Try to hang in there, Carnell.

565
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:10,553
Ahh!

566
00:26:18,498 --> 00:26:21,453
Infection caused a perforation
in his sigmoid colon.

567
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:22,463
It's repairable.

568
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,496
It means the antibiotics
aren't working.

569
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,055
Double the dose.
And add Tygacil to the list.

570
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,483
As soon as he's
out of surgery.

571
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:29,785
Where's Richie Rich?

572
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:31,523
He said he can't leave work.

573
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:33,659
Yeah, you told me that
two hours ago.

574
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:35,043
I'm not gonna lie.

575
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:36,603
Why? Because it's wrong?

576
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:38,383
Or because you're a coward?

577
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:39,737
Hmm, tough choice.

578
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:42,210
You'd be wasting
two hours of the kid's time.

579
00:26:42,556 --> 00:26:45,422
Is that deeply and unforgivably
morally wrong? No.

580
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:47,355
Because it's not
a waste of his time.

581
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:48,959
Unless we're wrong.

582
00:26:49,144 --> 00:26:51,881
Unless his condition's got
nothing to do with his friend's.

583
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:54,833
You're just afraid
of being wrong.

584
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:00,561
Your parents called.

585
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,333
- They had to catch an earlier...
- You don't have to lie to him.

586
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,116
Kid's on his way here.

587
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,282
- He got off work?
- Yeah. By vomitting blood.

588
00:27:09,543 --> 00:27:11,687
Ambulance is
ten minutes out.

589
00:27:18,573 --> 00:27:20,413
- You Taddy?
- What?

590
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:23,498
I love the name.
I never had a dog...

591
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:24,928
Take off his pants.

592
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,873
Taddy: Hey.

593
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:27,206
Don't talk to her.
Listen to me.

594
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:30,245
He's vomited in excess
of three units of blood.
He needs to be admitted before...

595
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:33,995
If you wanted to be a doctor,
maybe you should have buckled down
a little more in high school.

596
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:34,909
Bite me.

597
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:37,256
- What are you doing?
- Exactly how close were
you and Carnell?

598
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,295
Not so close.

599
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:41,234
Spend a lot of time
together in Jamaica?
Share a room?

600
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:44,281
Wait, you don't think...
Look, we're not gay.

601
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:46,838
I'm not saying you're gay.
I'm saying you had sex.

602
00:27:47,724 --> 00:27:49,757
Look, we're not gay.
We hardly even hung out.

603
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:52,586
Right, you flew him
down to Jamaica
because he won a contest.

604
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,950
No, he's in my frat.

605
00:27:54,228 --> 00:27:58,450
Between school and wrestling
and going home every break
to work at his father's junkyard,

606
00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:00,588
Carnell didn't have any time
to hang out with anybody.

607
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,008
House:
It's not fungus.

608
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:03,374
Cameron:
I already told you that.

609
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:06,185
There's no pustules.
It's not staph.

610
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,485
His dad's what?

611
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:11,868
His dad owns a
scrap metal salvage yard.

612
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:14,257
Carnell worked there
during breaks.

613
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:22,049
You lied.

614
00:28:22,238 --> 00:28:23,284
What are you talking about?

615
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,637
Oh yeah, of course, in this family
you probably need more specifics.

616
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:31,003
You told us you owned
a construction company,
not a salvage yard.

617
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:32,560
I know the way things work.

618
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,068
The better my job,
the better my son gets treated.

619
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:36,683
Right, that's why I'm mad.

620
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,336
We wasted all that
filet mignon on you.

621
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,777
Did your kid find anything unusual
the last time he worked for you?

622
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:43,941
- No.
- Braided wire?

623
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:46,947
Metal weights on each end,
a lead canister, maybe just the lid.

624
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:48,999
He probably used it
as a doorstop or a paperweight.

625
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,462
Why would he wanna...

626
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:54,586
Okay, here it comes.

627
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:58,872
I gave him an early graduation gift,
an old plumb I found.
It looks like a fishing weight.

628
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:02,313
I put it on a keychain,
so he'd always remember
where he came from.

629
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:04,217
So he can lie about it later.

630
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,317
- Where's the keychain?
- I don't know.

631
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:08,621
He never used it.
Just kept it as a good luck charm.

632
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,045
- Kept it where?
- I don't know.

633
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:12,468
Why?

634
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:14,425
Why does it matter?

635
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:16,566
Where are the
kid's clothes?

636
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,512
In the bureau back
in his regular room.

637
00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:20,037
You two,
get it to radiology.

638
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:20,892
His clothes?

639
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,793
The bureau.
Don't open it.

640
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,659
You, come with me.

641
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:32,160
Set it down there.

642
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,242
Now get out of here.
This thing is radioactive.

643
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:41,387
The chances of radiation
causing CNS symptoms...

644
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:46,777
Foreman: Wow.

645
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,501
[Radiation detector reacts harder]

646
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,279
Call the boys in the lead pajamas.

647
00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:12,033
Radiation measurements weren't
high enough to cause
central nervous system damage.

648
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:16,085
It might not have caused
nerve damage, but it definitely
destroyed his immune system.

649
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:17,556
And caused tumors.

650
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,594
We don't know that.
None of the MRIs showed anything.

651
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,951
Do a Pet Scan.

652
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:26,142
Check his cervical spine.

653
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:29,348
It's not gonna be good news.

654
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,593
Mr. Hall,
it's not good news.

655
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:41,118
The piece of metal
you gave Carnell was from an
industrial device used to test wells.

656
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:43,841
People aren't supposed to
just dump radioactive material.

657
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,142
But they do.

658
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:52,880
So what now?
I mean, what do you do?

659
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,166
Anyone who has had
contact with the source...

660
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:58,370
will have to immediately get
treatment for Radiation Sickness.

661
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,556
Taddy carried it
on his lap on a flight.

662
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:02,419
So there is a treatment?

663
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:04,295
Transfusions.

664
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:07,354
And we try to get the fluids
and the electrolytes balanced.

665
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:12,479
Carnell...he's had
much more exposure.

666
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:16,079
The equivalent of
about 70,000 chest x-rays.

667
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:20,424
His ability to create
white blood cells has been
completely destroyed.

668
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,967
That's why he can't
fight off this infection?

669
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:27,060
He's gonna need a
bone marrow transplant.

670
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:28,855
[Sighs]

671
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:31,783
And we did...
we did another Pet Scan.

672
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:36,147
There's a cavernous angioma
within his spinal cord. It's a tumor.

673
00:31:36,314 --> 00:31:39,354
That's what's been causing
the shocks and CNS symptoms.

674
00:31:40,337 --> 00:31:44,570
He has a tumor
inside of his spinal cord?

675
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:51,378
The cord is-is made of
strands put together,
sort of like a kite string.

676
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:56,354
The surgeon should
be able to pull the strands apart
and excise the tumor. But...

677
00:31:56,455 --> 00:32:04,275
Surgery on someone who's
as hemopoetically compromised
as your son is...extremely risky.

678
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,829
And, uh...

679
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:20,010
if you don't
do the surgery, I mean...

680
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:23,348
The tumor could cause
his breathing to stop.

681
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:25,290
Possibly his heart as well.

682
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,192
[Sobs]

683
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,568
There's no way
you could have known.

684
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,353
[Mr. Hall sighs]

685
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:45,666
You're gonna have to
come with us.

686
00:32:45,737 --> 00:32:47,123
You need to start
treatment yourself.

687
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:48,969
No, no, no, no, no, no.

688
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:51,846
I can start
my treatment later.

689
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,889
But he can't.

690
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:58,857
He needs to be
in a sterile isolation room
to prevent further infections.

691
00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:07,032
- Mom.
- We're early.

692
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:10,828
- It's great to see you.
- Oh, Greg, don't lie.

693
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,299
We came at a
bad time, didn't we?

694
00:33:15,383 --> 00:33:17,379
Actually, yeah. I...

695
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,482
I have to take a rain check.

696
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:21,415
Aw, plans have been made.

697
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,104
Wilson made 'em.

698
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:24,481
I asked him to cancel.

699
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:27,058
I'm dealing with kind of
a complicated case right now. So...

700
00:33:27,142 --> 00:33:31,710
Well, we'll just come back
when things aren't so out of control.

701
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:33,318
My team is busy.

702
00:33:33,434 --> 00:33:34,477
You don't wanna see us.

703
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:36,409
Mom, don't make me feel guilty.

704
00:33:36,493 --> 00:33:38,381
No, no.
Of course not, sorry.

705
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:41,523
I've got a patient
who's probably gonna
die of radiation poisoning.

706
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:43,801
So that means you can't eat.

707
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,129
Come on, let's grab a bite
in the cafeteria.

708
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:50,119
I'll buy you a Reuben.

709
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:54,958
I guess I got time
for a sandwich.

710
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:56,087
Good.

711
00:34:00,363 --> 00:34:00,861
Yeah?

712
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:03,864
I just wanted to let you know
Carnell's prepped for surgery.

713
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,196
Thank you.

714
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:09,712
Hi, I'm Allison Cameron.

715
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:11,270
I work with your son.

716
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:13,156
Greg's told us all about you.

717
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,493
Really?

718
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:18,355
- New, huh?
- Nope, just gullible.

719
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:21,489
I'm sorry. I was just
making fun of my son.

720
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,944
Not of you.

721
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:26,945
We were just about to go
to get something to eat.
Would you care to join us?

722
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,863
You don't have
a lot of time with your son.

723
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:34,732
Cameron:
Maybe another time.

724
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:46,095
Dr. Fedler:
Do you like the Beatles?

725
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:47,718
They're all right.

726
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:51,476
My 12-year-old just
turned me back onto them.

727
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:57,178
Dr. Fedler:
McCartney's gotta have
more money than God.

728
00:34:58,336 --> 00:35:01,155
Dr. Fedler:
I think that's all of it.
Reverse him.

729
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,419
How's he doing?

730
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,813
Looks pretty good down here.

731
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:09,005
Do I rock, or what?

732
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:11,179
[Monitor beeps]
Nurse:
His pressure's dropping.

733
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,184
- Give him another two units.
- I did already.

734
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:14,946
His heart rate's falling.

735
00:35:15,202 --> 00:35:16,549
Chase:
He's hemorrhaging.

736
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,810
They're talking about
mom's last trip to the dentist.

737
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:32,464
Grown children
talking to their parents,
nothing gets talked about.

738
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:34,758
Trust me.
You're not missing anything.

739
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:39,267
So besides work,
what you been up to?

740
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,160
Not much.

741
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,169
John:
You always say that.
Not much.

742
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:44,981
It's always the answer.

743
00:35:45,149 --> 00:35:47,527
Any new babes
you might wanna tell me about?

744
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:49,510
Leave him alone, John.

745
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:52,252
I got a new motorcycle.

746
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:57,961
You might have seen it out front.
It's orange with a gigantic scrape.

747
00:35:58,045 --> 00:36:00,419
Is it the one in the
handicapped parking?

748
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,415
Yeah.

749
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,013
Looks like crap,
but it drives great.

750
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:05,899
Well, you'll be careful, right?

751
00:36:06,281 --> 00:36:08,881
Last I checked
you still have two legs.

752
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:10,426
Actually three.

753
00:36:11,351 --> 00:36:13,077
You know what
your problem is, Greg?

754
00:36:13,161 --> 00:36:14,655
Shifting gears?

755
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,934
You just don't know
how lucky you are.

756
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:22,726
Where's the head?

757
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:32,107
Good thing
we got that cleared up.

758
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,210
He was just trying to help.

759
00:36:34,262 --> 00:36:35,743
I don't need help.

760
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:37,002
I know.

761
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,651
You're absolutely perfect
just the way you are.

762
00:36:57,895 --> 00:36:58,997
Thank you.

763
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:08,000
So how much longer
do you think he'll be in surgery?

764
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:09,817
It's hard to say.

765
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:15,128
Hmm...hmm.

766
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:20,438
[Chuckles]

767
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:24,357
You know, he just
started school when Ann died.

768
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:27,186
I was a mess. Hmm.

769
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:33,460
Still adjusting to being a parent,
much less a single parent.

770
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:38,919
You know, I used to put
cold pancakes in his lunch box.

771
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:43,880
[Laughs] I mean,
that was the only thing
I could make that he would eat.

772
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:46,999
You did okay.
He's a good kid.

773
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,155
Mr. Hall: Yah.

774
00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:55,890
Hey. So how is he?

775
00:37:56,842 --> 00:38:01,640
Well, the surgeon
has removed the tumor
without damaging the spinal cord.

776
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:07,018
But the infection has caused
another intestinal perforation.

777
00:38:07,903 --> 00:38:11,296
We stopped the bleeding,
but his white count keeps falling.

778
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,344
Okay. Um...

779
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,474
So what now?
Another drug?
Antibiotics? What?

780
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,408
I'm sorry.

781
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:26,990
The reality is no matter
what we give him, it's...

782
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:30,856
unlikely he's gonna be able
to fight off the infections.

783
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:57,478
Okay. Okay.

784
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,065
The father and the friend are
responding well to treatment.

785
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:08,866
Things aren't looking
so good for Carnell.

786
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:14,938
Thank you...
for not eating.

787
00:39:17,027 --> 00:39:19,215
It was none of my business.

788
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:23,670
They seem perfectly
pleasant, don't they?

789
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:25,255
They are.

790
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:27,693
He was a Marine pilot.

791
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:29,878
She was a housewife.

792
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:32,273
Married 47 years.

793
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,372
They had one child.

794
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:36,588
My mom is just
like everyone else.

795
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:39,352
She's nice enough.

796
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:42,326
Great sense of humor.
Hates confrontation.

797
00:39:43,953 --> 00:39:46,221
My dad's just like you.

798
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:49,870
Not the caring-till-
your-eyes pop-out part.

799
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:54,853
Just the insane moral compass
that won't let you lie
to anybody about anything.

800
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:58,406
It's a great quality for
boy scouts and police witnesses.

801
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,749
Crappy quality for a dad.

802
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:18,541
Hey.

803
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,086
How you doing?

804
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:23,690
I'm hanging in there.

805
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,205
I'm sorry
I lied to you about mom.

806
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,569
I'm sorry
I lied to you too.

807
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:40,689
There was nothing good
that came out of her dying.

808
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:42,796
I'm not mad.

809
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:45,816
I know why you did it.

810
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:49,654
It worked.

811
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:52,946
I never drink and drive.

812
00:40:59,305 --> 00:41:01,521
I'm scared, Dad.

813
00:41:05,555 --> 00:41:06,732
Come on.

814
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,744
There's nothing to be scared of.

815
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:13,205
You're gonna be just fine.

816
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:15,299
Don't play me.

817
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:18,562
I wanna know the truth.

818
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:22,374
I'm telling you the truth.

819
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,925
You're gonna be fine.

820
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:26,800
I swear.

821
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:34,577
I love you, dad.

822
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:38,808
I love you too.

823
00:41:54,183 --> 00:41:56,736
Why does he hate
seeing his parents?

824
00:41:57,203 --> 00:42:00,623
So his dad tells the truth,
he can't handle that?

825
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:03,472
He hates
being a disappointment.

826
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:06,814
He's a doctor.
World famous.

827
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:09,674
How disappointed can they be?

828
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:14,949
You know what I figure
is worse than watching
your son become crippled,

829
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:17,766
watching him be miserable.

830
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,808
